Summary


Short Ideas Consumer China


The stock looks cheap at 5x earnings but in reality, the stock deserves a 2x multiple
at best because, in our opinion, it is uninvestable.


A recent "acquisition" of a factory has put $77.5 million in SORL cash into the
coffers of the chairman and CEO's own company. SORL still awaits documents
showing actual ownership.


The CEO and family are using SORL as their own personal piggy bank, securing
over $140 million in loans with guarantees and cash deposits made by SORL
shareholders.


Investors in SORL have no legal recourse in China and are minority shareholders.
In effect, the CEO can do whatever he wants with the cash.


From auditors, to bankers, to China frauds, SORL has many associations that put it
in bad company. Where there's smoke, there's fire.

SORL Auto Parts, Inc. (NASDAQ:SORL) is a China-based manufacturer of automotive
brake systems and other parts for commercial vehicles, including heavy-duty trucks and
buses, passenger vehicles and rail. The company came public in 2004 via a reverse
takeout (RTO) of a US-listed shell company along with a slew of other China-based
companies.


During the period between 2004 and 2009, many Chinese companies came public in the
US using this reverse merger method which allowed for quicker listing and fewer
regulatory hurdles. It turns out that many of these companies were straight-up frauds.
So when SORL suddenly had a pop and its valuation doubled in a few months, our
interest was peaked.


Post our review of its business, it appears investors in SORL are ignoring several
significant risks. Since there is no legal recourse for US investors and there is a high
probability of fraudulent activity within these companies, we believe Chinese RTOs are
simply uninvestable. In our opinion, SORL is rightfully included in this list of uninvestable
securities.


Cheap For A Reason:


SORL is guiding to $14.5 million in net income for 2016, or about 75c per share. At
current valuation, the stock is trading about 5x earnings. On the surface, this may seem
cheap, but cheap relative to what? For most of the year, the stock has been trading for
2-3x trailing 2015 earnings of 69c.


First, we should point out that legitimate companies very rarely, if ever, trade at these
kind of low multiples. The same way you should know a company likely has a problem
when it pays a 20% dividend, you should also know that it likely has a problem when t
trades 2x earnings. That said, if the stock were to trade with a 2.5x P/E on 2016 EPS
the stock would be $1.88, or roughly 50% lower.


It would be easy to compare SORL to a US auto supplier but this would be a mistake
because a US company it is not. When you look at other micro-cap US-listed Chinese
companies you realize that they are pretty much all perennially cheap, and for good
reason. As the old saying goes, when something appears too good to be true, it usually
is. The truth is, as cheap as SORL appears to be, it's actually very expensive in
comparison to recent history.

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-china-fraud-boom-nasdaq-steps-up-scrutiny-of-shady-listings-2016-06-20
There are several reasons why US-listed micro cap Chinese companies are perennially
cheap but we'll focus on three main reasons.


Complex ownership structure1.


No legal recourse2.


High risk of fraudulence3.


One of the oddities of US-listed Chinese companies that makes them much different
from their US counterparts is their complex ownership structures. China does not allow
direct foreign investment in Chinese companies. However, this has not stopped
investors from attempting to invest in them. Foreigners have worked with Chinese
companies for years devising ways to gain access to the cash flows of those companies
in exchange for capital. China has largely allowed this to happen with a watchful eye. It
is not uncommon for Chinese companies to create joint ventures based in Hong Kong,
the Cayman or Virgin Islands for the purpose of allowing direct foreign "ownership" in
them. The result is complex and confusing ownership structures that are typically best
left to the most astute investors. Even then these investments are not without significant
risk.


Foreign investment in Chinese companies ignores the obvious. China doesn't want
foreigners to actual have ownership rights in Chinese companies. This means you
effectively have no legal recourse. Additionally, we doubt the current political
environment likely increases China's concern for US investors in Chinese companies.
This gets to the heart of what it is that you actually "own" when you invest in SORL and
it also applies to any US-listed Chinese company. If you cannot enforce your rights as a
shareholder than what do you really own? Ownership is based on control. If you have no
control, you have no ownership.



http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/11/13/why-chinese-stocks-leave-us-investors-vulnerable

http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/us-investors-lose-billions-alleged-chinese-stock-schemes/story?id=18164787
With this legal vacuum in place aside complex and confusing ownership structures, the
door to fraud has been left wide open and executives of these companies have been all
too willing to step on through. US investors have willingly handed over billions of dollars
to these companies. They're half a world away and protected by a government who
couldn't care less about the rights of US investors. In the past five years, dozens of US-
listed Chinese companies have been accused of fraud and in retrospect, it makes total
sense. The phrase "taking candy from a baby" comes to mind. As we said earlier,
ownership is about control. So let's see what investors in SORL control.


The company was original founded by current Chairman and CEO Xiao Ping Zhang and
his brother Xiao Feng Zhang in 1987. Xiao Feng Zhang is currently a member of the
board and was the COO from 2004-2010. The Chairman/CEO's wife Shu Ping Chi is
also a member of the board of SORL. Combined, these three individuals own 58.8% of
SORL stock. Another 10% minority holding is held by the Ruili Group. The Zhang family
is the controlling shareholder of the Ruili Group. Combined, this puts the Zhang family in
control of 68.8% of SORL. This puts them in complete control of SORL as a majority
shareholder and effectively makes US shareholder voting rights meaningless. The family
can choose to do whatever they like with SORL shareholder money.

Where's The Money?


As any investor knows, investing is about making money. SORL currently only has $7.5
million in cash on its books. It claims to be a highly profitable, high cash flow company
so where did all the money go? It certainly has not gone to investors. Between 2009 and
2016, SORL made approximately $117.3 million from operating activities.

We won't hold you in suspense any longer. The vast majority of the cash has gone back
to Chairman and CEO Xiao Ping Zhang and his family. In 2010, they spent $25 million to
acquire business assets from the Ruili Group. Remember, Ruili Group = Xiao Ping
Zhang and family.


On August 31, 2010, the company, through the Joint Venture, executed an
Agreement to acquire the assets of the hydraulic brake, power steering, and
automotive electrical operations of the Ruili Group (the "Seller", a related party under
common control)...the purchase price was RMB 170 million, or approximately
USD$25 million.


~SORL 10-K, 3/29/11, pg. 27


This year, they spent another $77.5 million in cash to purchase another Ruili Group
asset.


On May 5, 2016, the company entered into a Purchase Agreement (the "Purchase
Agreement") with the Ruili Group through Ruian, a related party under common
control, pursuant to which the company agreed to purchase the land use rights and
factory facilities located at No. 2666 Kaifaqu Avenue, Rui'an Economic Development
Zone, Rui'an City, Zhejiang Province, the People's Republic of China (the
"Development Zone Facility"). In exchange for the Development Zone Facility, the
company will transfer to the Ruili Group the land use rights and factory facilities of the
Dongshan Facility that Ruian currently owns, plus RMB501,000,000 (approximately
$77,540,000) in cash. The total floor areas of the Dongshan Facility and the
Development Zone Facility are 58,714 square meters and 157,619 square meters,
respectively.


~SORL 10-Q, 5/16/16, pg. 20


These two transactions, along with some other purchases of capital equipment, have
exhausted most of SORL's cash balance, leaving SORL with a paltry $7.5 million
currently on its balance sheet. We took a closer look at exactly what it is that SORL
shareholders accomplished with the acquisition of these assets, and in our opinion, it's
not a great deal for them.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420411017962/v216304_10k.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420416102493/v438718_10q.htm
To better understand the situation, we reviewed SORL's SEC filings back to 2004. In
September 2007, the company purchased a factory from the Ruili Group for ~$20
million.


On September 28, 2007, Ruili Group Ruian Auto Parts Co. Ltd., a subsidiary of the
company purchased land rights, a manufacturing plant, and an office building from
Ruili Group Co. Ltd., a related party, for an aggregate purchase price of
approximately RMB152 million (approximately US$20.2 million).


~SORL 10-K, 3/27/08, pg. 36


Based on our research, we believe that the property purchased in 2007 is the
"Dongshan Facility" noted above that was just sold back to Ruili Group. The Dongshan
Facility has a floor area of 58,714 square meters. This property was sold back to Ruili
Group for $19.1 million as part of the "Development Zone Facility" purchase. That along
with an additional $77.5 million in cash was used to purchase the 157,619 square meter
Development Zone Facility for a total purchase price of $95.6 million. This appears to
add production capacity of about 100,000 square meters, but it turns out to be a lot less.
SORL was already leasing over 89k square meters of the Development Zone Facility.


The company is currently leasing 89,229 square meters of the Development Zone
Facility from Ruili Group for its brake systems business...


~SORL 10Q, 5/16/16, pg. 20


The production capacity of SORL prior to the acquisition was the Dongshan Facility
consisting of 58,714 square meters and 89,229 square meters of the Development Zone
Facility that SORL leased from Ruili Group.


Total square meters of production capacity prior to acquisition of the Development Zone
Facility = 58,714 + 89,229 = 147,943 square meters.


By purchasing the Development Zone Facility they added less than 10k square
meters of production capacity.


157,619 - 147,943 = 9,676 square meters of added production capacity post acquisition
of the Development Zone Facility.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420408017663/v108230_10-k.htm
The acquisition of the Development Zone Facility from Ruili Group (controlled by the
CEO) added very little net capacity to SORL but it was a very efficient way to transfer
$77.5 million in SORL shareholder cash into the coffers of Ruili Group, a firm
privately controlled by CEO and Chairman Xiao Ping Zhang and his family.


SORL The Piggy Bank:


We believe Chairman Xiao Ping Zhang, his brother Xiao Feng Zhang and his wife Shu
Ping Chi are using SORL shareholder money as their own personal piggy bank. Below
is a list of guarantees and cash deposits made by SORL on behalf of Ruili Group and
associated entities beginning in 2013. To date, SORL shareholders have been on the
hook for a total of $140.5 million for loans made to either the Ruili Group or to a relative
of the chairman's wife.


We believe this kind of activity would be unacceptable for a US-based company. We
consider these transactions highly unethical and at an absolute minimum, they are
cause for serious conflicts of interest. Unfortunately, since the company is located in
China and controlled by the chairman there appears to be very little SORL shareholders
can do about the situation. This is a good example of why no matter how "cheap" SORL
appears, it's never really cheap when considering the potential for an entire loss on
investment. Chinese reverse merger companies are simply uninvestable. If this stock
were such a bargain, than certainly professional money managers would want to own it.
SORL has no meaningful institutional ownership.
Auditor Problems:


Up until July 2013, SORL was audited by EFP Rotenberg, LLP. EFP was banned from
auditing US-listed Chinese companies in 2014 based on audits of Universal Travel
Group. UTG was another Chinese reverse merger company that has since been
delisted from the NYSE. In the SEC's administrative proceeding against SORL's former
auditor it said the following:


Rotenberg did not have adequate policies and procedures as to client acceptance at
the time it approved UTG as a client, which allowed the final acceptance of the UTG
engagement without attempting to make any inquiries of the Predecessor Auditor.


and this...


Rotenberg's...failure to abide by PCAOB standards in the UTG audit... involved
repeated instances of unreasonable conduct.


and this...


Rotenberg shall not issue any audit report, accept any audit engagement, or play a
substantial role in the preparation or furnishing of any audit report for any issuer or
registrant, U.S. or foreign, that files with the Commission

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2014/33-9608.pdf
The SEC also stated that Rotenberg "Failed to obtain sufficient competent evidence,
exercise due professional care, exhibit heightened professional skepticism, and control
the confirmation process." Additionally the firm was fined $50k. Other firms audited by
EFP Rotenberg are all trading on the OTC now.


China Gengsheng Minerals (NYSEMKT:OTC:CHGS)


China Internet Cafe Holdings Group (OTCQB:CICC)


China Digital Animation Development (OTC:CHDA)


Tanke Biosciences (OTCPK:TNBI)


First China Pharmaceutical (OTC:FCPG)


Universal Travel Group (OTCPK:UTRA)


We wondered if the SEC proceeding against Rotenberg's audit of UTG was a company
specific issue. Perhaps the case was an isolated incident. We dug further and found that
this is highly unlikely. In 2011 the PCAOB conducted an inspection of EFP Rotenberg. In
that inspection, the PCAOB found that the firm had deficiencies related to identifying
proper GAAP accounting and proper revenue audit procedures.


The inspection team identified what it considered to be audit deficiencies. The
deficiencies identified in the audit reviewed included deficiencies of such significance
that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm did not obtain sufficient
competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the issuer's financial statements.
Those deficiencies were -  
(1) the Firm's failure to identify, or to address appropriately, a departure from GAAP
that related to a potentially material misstatement in the audited financial statements
concerning a subsidy; and


(2) the failure to perform sufficient audit procedures related to revenue.


These appear to be issues that the PCAOB was well aware of. It notes in this
inspection, that in a prior inspection from 2006 it had warned Rotenberg of the potential
for fraud.

During an inspection of the Firm conducted in 2006, the PCAOB inspection team
brought to the Firm's attention that the Firm's procedures appeared not to provide
sufficient assurance that the Firm performed audit procedures to test journal entries
and other adjustments for evidence of possible material misstatements due to fraud.
An appropriate approach to monitoring would have resulted in the Firm avoiding this
deficiency in audits performed after they were brought to the Firm's attention, yet the
same deficiency was noted in this inspection.


SORL's new auditor, MaloneBailey isn't much better. MaloneBailey has stated that in its
audits it is basically taking the word of management in regards to internal controls over
financial reporting.


We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board(United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. The Company is not required to have,
nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial
reporting. Our audits included consideration of internal control over financial reporting
as a basis for designing audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances,
but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Company's internal control over financial reporting.


~SORL 10-K, 3/31/15, pg. 33


Not to be outdone by Rotenberg, in the PCAOB's inspection of MaloneBailey in 2014 it
also had some harsh comments regarding deficient accounting standards at
MaloneBailey.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420415019698/v405073_10k.htm
Certain of the deficiencies identified were of such significance that it appeared to the
inspection team that the Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained
sufficient appropriate audit evidence to support its opinion that the financial
statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with
applicable financial reporting framework and/or its opinion about whether the issuer
had maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial
reporting ("ICFR"). In other words, in these audits, the auditor issued an opinion
without satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements were free of material misstatement and/or the issuer
maintained effective ICFR.


Whether or not associated with a disclosed financial reporting misstatement, an
auditor's failure to obtain the reasonable assurance that the auditor is required to
obtain is a serious matter. It is a failure to accomplish the essential purpose of the
audit, and it means that, based on the audit work performed, the audit opinion should
not have been issued.


Audit A 
■ The Firm failed to perform sufficient procedures to test the issuer's acquisition of
substantially all of the assets and certain liabilities of a related party 
■ The Firm failed to perform sufficient procedures to test the occurrence and
valuation of revenue.


Audit B 
■ The Firm failed to perform sufficient procedures to test the occurrence and
valuation of revenue by haphazardly selecting a sample of revenue transactions to
test these assertions. 
■ The Firm failed to perform sufficient procedures to test the valuation of inventory

Incredibly, much of the same language was used in describing accounting deficiencies
by MaloneBailey in the inspection that took place just one year before in 2013. So it
would appear it was unable to make improvements in audit procedures over the course
of the year between inspections.

SORL originally was brought public via reverse merger with a shell company called
Enchanted Village, Inc. The shell was supplied by a firm called Keating Investments,
LLC owned and operated by Timothy J. Keating. In a piece of marketing material from
2005, Keating proudly displays that it was also the firm that provided the shell for now
infamous Puda Coal, Inc. (OTC:PUDA).

In 2011 Puda Coal was exposed as a massive fraud when the chairman of the company,
Ming Zhao, essentially stole all the operating assets of the company by transferring
ownership of the company to himself without shareholder approval. He then proceeded
to sell off the operating assets and recklessly levered up the company with $530 million
in debt. In 2015, the SEC won a $250 million judgment against Chairman Ming Zhao
and CEO Liping Zhu. "Here, defendants came into the U.S. public markets to raise
capital for their coal mining venture and then absconded with the proceeds, leaving the
shareholders of Puda with an empty shell," the SEC wrote. "In short, they stole the coal
company for their own purposes and fraudulently used the U.S. capital markets to
finance their expansion plans."


In Puda Coal's very first quarterly conference call with US investors as a public
company, the call was led by a "T. Keating." We presume this is the same T. Keating of
Keating Investments, LLC. We were also able to connect Puda directly to SORL. In
September of 2005, Puda and SORL traveled together for nearly three weeks on a
whirlwind tour of the US and Canada. Keating Investments sponsored the roadshow.

Keating found the shell for SORL but they weren't the bankers. SORL was taken public
by Maxim Group as sole bookrunner and Chardan Capital Markets as co-manager.
Ellenoff Grossman & Schole acted as counsel to the underwriter. Besides SORL, all the
other companies Ellenoff Grossman & Schole have been involved with are delisted,
bankrupt, or have gone dark.


Chardan Capital Markets has had a particularly controversial and troubling past. Kerry
Propper is the former CEO of Chardan (now non-executive chairman). His father Dr.
Richard Propper runs a similarly named venture capital group, Chardan Capital, in
California. In the 1990s, Dr. Propper settled with the SEC over disclosure problems, and
in 2005 and 2007 he was sued by the federal government for defrauding the Small
Business Administration out of $32 million. He ended up with a fine. Kerry Propper also
received a small fine.


Dr. Propper and son were also sued by investors of a Chinese firm called Huiheng
Medical. The CFO of that company stated on a call with investors that the company was
"spending substantial amounts of money paying bribes to officials in control of the
Chinese hospitals," according to the suit. The lawsuit also alleged that Huiheng prepaid
firms controlled by its CEO, who holds most of Huiheng's stock, for material that was
never delivered. Later, it would write off the debts. The case was later settled.

SORL is a China based manufacturer of automotive brake systems and other parts for
commercial vehicles including heavy-duty trucks and buses, passenger vehicles and
rail. 81.7% of sales are to the commercial vehicle industry and the majority of these
sales are to the heavy-duty truck segment. 18.3% of sales are to the passenger vehicle
industry. Over 80% of sales come from braking systems while "other parts" includes
power steering, air controlling systems and automotive electrical parts. SORL sells parts
into three main supplier categories including Chinese original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs), Chinese aftermarket and international markets, according to the company.


Below are pictures of SORL's factory. The equipment looks old and outdated. Note the
areas near the floor. Most of the equipment is banged up with scratches, dents and
years of neglect. The bright yellow caution lines along the floor denoting various
sections have nearly worn away. The word that immediately came to mind when we first
saw these photos was "grimey."


Grimey: From "grime;" something very dirty or filthy, caked with dirt. Marked by
abjectness stemming from neglect.

Note the station to the left and the barely visible yellow caution lines along the floor.
Most of this equipment looks 20 years old.


Signage in the upper left corner confirms this is SORL.

In comparison, here is what some of its competitors' factories look like.


Guangxi Yuchai
The equipment looks far cleaner and newer.


Shanxi Fashite


Clean equipment and floors. Note the bright yellow caution line is clearly visible.
Haerbing Dongan Automobile


Again, very clean floors and equipment. Highly professional attire.


US Factories:


Nexteer
Equipment looks new and well organized.


Delphi (DLPH)

Floors you could eat off.


What's clear from these pictures is that to get SORL equipment standards up to the
standards of the competition, it would take several millions of dollars in capex. This is
money it no longer has post the acquisition of the Development Zone Facility from Ruili.


SORL's a Top 100 Supplier?


In every press release in the "about" section SORL claims, it is a top 100 auto
component supplier in China.


SORL is listed among the top 100 auto component suppliers in China


~8-K, 11/15/16


SORL was a top 100 supplier in China from 2007 to 2009. After 2009, we could find no
evidence to support the claim that SORL is a top 100 auto component supplier in China.
In 2009, the company supposedly produced revenue of $141 million and that
supposedly increased to $219 million in 2015. Despite the increase, our review of top
100 auto suppliers in China yielded no results for SORL after 2009.


In 2007 SORL was ranked 37th...

We were unable to find the top 100 China component supplier list for the years 2012
and 2014. That said, we are fairly confident that if it wasn't on the list in any other year
since 2009, it is unlikely it made the list in these other years.


In 2012 China's Quality Inspection Bureau produced a list of companies that exhibited
"severe misconduct" by forging, altering, or buying/selling inspection certificates for the
product they produced. SORL is the second name on the list.


Slowly Going Dark:


Over time, SORL appears to be communicating and engaging with US investors less
and less. As it does so, it becomes more difficult to conduct proper analysis of the
business. For example, when the company first came public, Chairman and CEO Xiao
Ping Zhang was present on quarterly earnings calls. The last call on which we could
confirm his attendance was in Q3 2008. We could find no example of any other call he
has attended since that time. In fact, neither the CEO or CFO Ms. Zong Yun Zhou
attend conference calls. The calls are hosted by COO Jinrui Yu and Accounting
Manager Min Kan Lin. We believe the company has disengaged from SORL investors.

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SORL/earnings/transcripts?source=content_type%3Areact%7Csection%3Amain_content%7Cbutton%3Abody_link
We found more evidence of this in reviewing the company's websites. The company has
spent very little time or effort maintaining its websites. The US investor relations website
has been poorly maintained as can be seen below. Several copyright dates haven't
been updated in years.



http://www.sorl.cn/?p=83

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/17/47406777-14819962988783715_origin.png
SORL's been traded on Nasdaq since 2006. Apparently 10 years isn't enough time to
add disclaimer, privacy policy and terms of use date to its US website.


SORL Doesn't Own The Factory:


Investors in SORL don't own the factory or the property that the factory is on that they
just paid $96.5 million for and in our opinion, they never will. In China you can't "own"
property in the traditional sense that we are accustomed to in the US. The government
ultimately owns all the property and buildings. What you can own in China are land use
rights. When SORL purchased the Development Zone Facility from the CEO's Ruili
Group it paid $96.5 million for the factory and the land use rights. Seven months later,
ownership and land use rights have not been transferred from Ruili Group to SORL
despite the fact that the transaction was completed and most of the cash has been
transferred to Ruili.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2016/12/17/47406777-14819967862778125_origin.png

http://www.sorl.cn/
On May 5, 2016, the Company entered into a Purchase Agreement with the Ruili
Group through Ruian, pursuant to which the company agreed to exchange the
Dongshan Facility plus RMB501 million (approximately $76.5 million) in cash for
Development Zone Facility...as of September 30, 2016, total amount of RMB481
million (approximately $73.5 million) was paid to the Ruili Group...as of the filing
date, the company has not obtained the land use right certificate nor the
property ownership certificate of the buildings of the Development Zone
Facility. (emphasis added)


10-Q, 11/14/16, pg. 14


In our opinion, it is highly unlikely that SORL will ever own the building and land use
rights. Our confidence stems from the fact that SORL has never owned any building or
land use rights. Since SORL's founding in 2004, it has mainly operated out of two
facilities. Those facilities are:


The Dongshan Facility1.


The Development Zone Facility2.


Both of these facilities were bought from Ruili Group. The Dongshan Facility was
purchased, from Ruili Group in 2007 for approximately $20 million. SORL was leasing
space in the Development Zone Facility prior to purchase. In this recent transaction, in
exchange for the Development Zone Facility SORL sold the Dongshan Facility back to
Ruili Group for $19.1 million and paid an additional $77.5 million in cash. However, what
is very clearly stated in SEC filings is that SORL technically never owned the Dongshan
Facility or the land use rights for that property.


The company has never obtained the land use right certificate nor the property
ownership certificate of the building for the Dongshan Facility.


10-Q, 11/14/16, pg. 19



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420416133965/v452495_10q.htm
Again, the Dongshan Facility was purchased in 2007. Nine years later SORL still didn't
technically own a factory and land use rights that it paid $20 million for with investor
cash! So the obvious question is, why is it taking so long to transfer the ownership rights
from Ruili Group to SORL? According to the company's SEC filings, it was negotiating
taxes owed on the transaction with the Chinese government.


The company has been negotiating with the government for a reduction in or
exemption from the tax being sought by the government in connection with the
transfer of the land use rights, and pending resolution of that issue, we have deferred
accrual or payment of the tax. Due to the lack of resolution of that issue, the land use
right certificate and the property ownership certificate have not been issued to the
company. There is no assurance that we can conclude the negotiations with the
government and obtain a favorable result. We plan to conclude negotiations with the
government and to obtain the land use rights certificate as soon as practicable.


10-K, 3/31/14, pg. 30


So it was in negotiations over taxes for nine years and never resolved the issue. Then it
sold the property back to Ruili Group. This seems like an awfully long time for a
negotiation. After allowing SORL to slide with this explanation for several years, the
SEC was getting curious too beginning back in 2011.


We note your disclosure that you have not yet obtained the land use right certificate
however, you have applied to obtain the land use right certificate. In light of this fact,
please explain to us why you believe that it is appropriate to record an asset for this
land use right as of December 31, 2010 and 2009. As part of your response, please
explain to us why you believe that the amount of the asset is recoverable at
December 31, 2010.


~SEC letter to SORL, 8/22/11


Post this letter, SORL began providing more detail about the Dongshan Facility
transaction. In a letter to the SEC in 2014 responding to more questions about the
transaction, we learn that the amount of taxes owed under dispute is at most 3% of the
transaction or $724,580. Below is an excerpt of SORL's response to the SEC regarding
the Dongshan Facility.



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420414019189/v371893_10k.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000000000011050482/filename1.pdf
Specifically, the company reserved the relevant tax amount of RMB 4,560,000
(approximately $724,580). This amount was determined based on a 3% tax rate on
the consideration paid for the land use right in the transaction, which the company
considered as the most probable amount of tax liability.


~SORL response to SEC, 9/11/14


It spent nine years "negotiating" over what it claims in its own correspondence with the
SEC what they consider to be an "immaterial amount." We agree that it is an immaterial
amount, so why did it fight paying it for nine years? By refusing to pay taxes on the
Dongshan facility, the company was unable to obtain paperwork showing SORL as the
rightful owner of the factory and land use rights. Rights conveniently owned by the CEO
over this period.


We have a theory for what we believe is happening here. Since the CEO and his family
are the controlling shareholders of both Ruili Group and SORL, he sees the transaction
as an intercompany transaction. It is our opinion that essentially, he feels to pay taxes to
the government for a transfer of ownership from one of his entities, to another of his
entities is a waste of his money. In other words, in his mind he owns the property
whether the paperwork is in the name of Ruili Group or SORL, so why pay taxes on it?


What this obviously ignores is the legal rights of SORL shareholders. Without paperwork
showing SORL as the rightful owner of the property, they have no legal claim on it.
Forget the unwillingness of the Chinese government to help foreign shareholders.
Forget the fact that in effect SORL shareholder votes don't count. Forget that these
companies are beyond the SEC's reach. Even if they weren't, SORL shareholders still
wouldn't have any paperwork showing they own any factory, ever. This again highlights
why this company is uninvestable and deserves a severely depressed multiple. As we
stated earlier, you don't own what you can't control.


How Can You Trust Its Financials?



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420414055424/filename1.htm
When reviewing the list of executive officers and directors from the most recent proxy
statement it wasn't hard to see that something wasn't right. Ms. Yu Hong Li is missing
from the list. Ms Yu Hong Li has been a member of the board for two years and been
the chairperson of the Audit Committee since June 2015. According to her profile she
has more than 25 years of experience in accounting and auditing. The company claims
"Ms. Li qualifies as an audit committee financial expert under Nasdaq rules and SEC
rules and regulations," yet somehow she and the rest of the board apparently failed to
recognize she is not listed as a director in the list below.


In addition, the share sum for Xiao Ping Zhang, Xiao Feng Zhang and Shu Ping Chi is
incorrect. The total sum should be 11,359,403. These errors have been left uncorrected
for two years. We find this extremely disturbing. If the company can't even put together a
proper list of its executives and directors and the number of shares owned by those
individuals, how can we trust the rest of its financials? This lack of attention to detail is
yet another example of a management that appears to have disengaged from the
investor base. Who knows what other "errors" may lurk in its financial statements?


In Conclusion:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420416097674/v438324_def14a.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/714284/000114420415061963/v423313_sc13d.htm

SORL is amongst a slew of US listed Chinese reverse merger stocks that came public
between 2004 and 2009, a period brimming with fraudulent activity in the category. The
reverse merger structure allowed Chinese companies to list in the US with lower
regulatory hurdles. In addition, the amount of fraudulent activity clearly shows that very
little due diligence was performed on many of these companies. These factors in
combination with complex ownership structures and a lack of legal recourse exacerbate
a situation ripe with fraud.


As a result, SORL has been lumped-in with this group and its valuation reflects this. The
stock looks perennially cheap, typically trading between 2-3x earnings just earlier this
year. Recently investors have driven the stock closer to 5x earnings despite the fact that
the risks associated with the company have not changed. In our opinion the company is
simply uninvestable.


To own shares in SORL, one must ignore the fact that in addition to a lack of legal
recourse, they are minority shareholders. As a result, their voting rights simply do not
count. The company can do, and does do, whatever they like with minority shareholder
cash. Recently the company unilaterally decided to spend $96.5 million to buy a factory
that is owned by the Chairman & CEO and his family. $77.5 million of the transaction
was in cash, conveniently transferring the cash out of SORL and into the coffers of the
Ruili Group, a company controlled by the Chairman.


In exchange the company gained control of a factory (Development Zone Facility) and
the accompanying land use rights. However, to date the certificates and documents
showing SORL as the legal owner of this facility have not been transferred to SORL
despite the fact that Ruili Group has received the majority of the cash. In effect, SORL
shareholders have paid $96.5 million for a promise by the CEO and his family to honor
SORL shareholder rights of ownership on the facility.


Based on a very similar situation with the Dongshan Facility, we believe it is highly likely
that SORL shareholders will never technically own the Development Zone Facility. We
find this an extremely disturbing development for minority SORL shareholders and
highly unethical. Unfortunately, these types of risks are all too common amongst
Chinese RTO's involving related party transactions.
It's important to point out that in October of last year, a group consisting of the CEO, his
brother and wife proposed an offer to take the company private at $2.84 per share. The
stock rallied but in January of this year. It withdrew the offer. It claimed to withdraw the
offer due to "market conditions." The stock quickly dropped and languished below $2 per
share up until August.


At any point from January to August of this year it could have renewed the offer since
"market conditions" vastly improved, but it never did. It also could have offered to buy
the company at a lower price since the stock was consistently near all-time lows, still it
never did. In our opinion, the only likely "asset" worth acquiring would have been the
cash on the balance sheet but it figured out another way to access that cash with the
Development Zone Facility acquisition while essentially sacrificing nothing.


In addition, the chairman and his family appear to be using SORL as their own personal
piggy bank as they use the company's cash to guarantee loans and make actual cash
deposits to secure loans to Ruili Group and associated entities. The loan guarantees
and cash deposits in total are over $140 million in recent years. We find this type of
behavior unethical and believe the company is able to perpetrate this type of activity
specifically due to their corporate structure. It is hard to imagine a US based counterpart
getting away with this type of activity without repercussions. This again highlights why
SORL deserves a very low multiple.


A look inside its factory shows the equipment is old, outdated and "grimey," especially
when compared to its competitors based in both China and the US. It is clear that to
maintain the facilities they will need to spend millions in capex upgrades to stay
competitive. Unfortunately, the vast majority of its cash is now in the coffers of Ruili
Group.


SORL's previous auditor, EFP Rotenberg, was banned from auditing Chinese
companies by the SEC. Their current auditor, MaloneBailey, also has had several
problems involving proper audits of Chinese companies. This in combination with a
string of individuals with either personal run-ins with the law, or connections to other
Chinese frauds like in the case of PUDA Coal, ad plenty of speculation to the situation.
As the old saying goes, "where there's smoke, there's fire."

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136% And through July 15 his portfolio is up 23% YTD and is beating the market


It appears based on our research, that the company is dishonestly claiming that it is a
"top 100 supplier" of auto parts in China. The last time we can confirm it the top 100 list
was in 2009. It appears to have not made the list since. The Chinese government has
also cited the company for "severe misconduct" for forging, altering and buying/selling
inspection certificates.


Over time, the company appears to be "going dark." In the early years of being a public
company, Chairman and CEO Xiao Ping Zhang regularly attended quarterly conference
calls. Beginning around 2013 he no longer attends the calls. The CFO also does not
attend quarterly calls. The corporate website(s) are not being properly updated or
maintained. The investor relations site is not updated with the latest information for
shareholders. SEC files reporting a list of the executives and directors and how many
shares are owned between them are inaccurate. Their auditor has admitted it has not
performed an audit of the company's financial controls. If they can't provide accuracy on
these basic elements, how can we trust that their financials are being accurately
reported?


Our review of SORL has exposed several risks investors in the company are exposed to
that we feel are not being reflected in current valuation. Ultimately, we believe Chinese
RTO's are uninvestable, giving them a value of zero. In our opinion this is completely
justified because as an investor in these companies, you have no shareholder control
and you have no legal recourse to enforce control.


That said, we are willing to consider how investors have, rightly or wrongly, valued the
company in the past to determine a price target. In our opinion, SORL deserves a
valuation at the lowest end of its historical trading range which is approximately 2x
earnings. The company has guided to earnings of $14.5 million for this year or
approximately 75c per share. Therefore we believe the company deserves a valuation of
2x 75c per share, or $1.50 for approximately 55% downside.
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market
by 47%.
