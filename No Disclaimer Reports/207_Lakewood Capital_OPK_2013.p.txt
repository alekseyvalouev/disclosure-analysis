OPKO HEALTH:  THE PLACEBO EFFECT 


The view expressed below is the opinion of Lakewood Capital Management.  Lakewood currently 


has a short position in the security discussed herein.  Lakewood may change its view or position 


at any time.  Please do your own research. 


“Oh what a tangled web we weave, when first we practice to deceive.” 


–  Sir Walter Scott 


A.)  Executive Summary 


We will show below why we believe Opko shareholders have unknowingly been fed a placebo 


and why we believe the shares are worth 75% to 100% less than where they are currently trading. 


Opko is a development stage pharmaceutical company that was formed in 2007 via a reverse 


merger engineered by the acclaimed Dr. Phillip Frost (Chairman of Teva Pharmaceuticals and 


investment bank Ladenburg Thalmann).  We believe shares in Opko Health (OPK) (“Opko” or 


the “Company”) are grossly overvalued, and at a $5 billion fully-diluted market capitalization, 


the shares are as disconnected from reality as any company we have ever seen.   


The Company’s $5 billion fully-diluted market capitalization completely ignores:  


 the Company’s history of failures, disappointments and overhyped opportunities;  


 the low likelihood of meaningful commercial success in any of the Company’s products 


as well as the associated limitations and risks; 


 the Company’s dismal financial performance; 


 unrealistically bullish and perennially incorrect analyst forecasts from related and biased 


parties; 


 concerning affiliations between the Company’s management and what we believe are 


serial stock promoters; and  


 a cult-like following in the stock largely based on regular insider purchases that we 


believe are a red herring to drum up retail investor buying.   


We make the following assertions: 


1. Opko has a history of overpromising and under-delivering:  nearly every legacy 


opportunity Opko has pursued over its history has ended in delay or failure despite 


much initial hype.   As shown below, since its formation until the end of 2012, we have 


found 30 products or investments that Opko has claimed to be working on and 25 of 


those appear to have ended in delay, disappointment or total failure.  Only 5 relatively 



http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/opk?source=search_general&s=opk
2 





minor products appear to be on track.  Opko has engaged in so many highly touted 


random deals and acquisitions that it must be nearly impossible for shareholders to even 


know what they own any more.  Seemingly every year, the Company comes up with a 


brand new product or drug opportunity to capture investors’ interest and keep the story 


going. 


2. The Company’s Latin American drug distribution business is practically worthless 


to Opko shareholders.  Opko acquired two Latin American generic drug distribution 


companies for $20 million ($0.04 per Opko share), forming the basis for this business.
1
  


Although it has historically accounted for the majority of Opko’s revenues, it is tiny and 


appears to be challenged, with an annualized gross profit of only around $10 million.
2
  


After a reasonable allocation of SG&A, it is unlikely this business even makes a profit. 


3. The Company’s Alzheimer’s Test (licensed for no upfront payment in 2009), which 


was nearly the entire basis for the Company’s value one year ago, isn’t working as 


hoped and is highly unlikely to ever be commercialized.   This test essentially was the 


source of all investor interest in Opko in 2012 with the analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann 


predicting a market opportunity that could “approach $3 billion annually.”
3
  A license to 


the test was acquired for what appears to have been essentially no upfront consideration 


from the University of Texas-Southwestern in 2009.  The basic idea was a blood test that 


could diagnose Alzheimer’s (currently the only definitive diagnosis is autopsy).  As it 


turns out, the Alzheimer’s test has not proven to be as good as the initial study (which 


was based on just six Alzheimer’s patients in advanced stages of the disease).  Today, 


Opko appears to have moved on, downplaying the test’s significance and making just a 


brief mention of it at the back of recent investor presentations.  The Jefferies analyst had 


assigned $3 per share ($1 billion at the time) to this business just last year.
4
  Today, it has 


been removed from her net asset value calculations given the test’s apparent failure.
5
 


4. Claros Diagnostics (acquired for $30 million in 2011), which was repeatedly hyped 


by the Company, makes one product and it doesn’t work.   The basic concept was to 


have a small blood test system that can be used to run tests in-house during a visit to the 


doctor without having to wait for results from a lab.  There are considerable challenges to 


broad adoption for this system.  Our research has indicated that a lot of doctors do not 


want to deal with the paperwork associated with in-house lab testing.  Also, as one doctor

told us, “the reimbursement needs to be more lucrative to spend 10 minutes on lab work 


vs. 10 minutes with another patient.”
6
   


The timeline for commercialization has been repeatedly delayed from “end of year 2012” 


to “2013” to “2014”
 
and now as late as “Q3 2015.”


7,8,9,10
  According to our discussions 


with the Company and a physician closely tracking the progress of Claros, the product 


isn’t working as it has a high failure rate.
11


  Even if they could fix the problems, one 


physician tracking Claros did not see a huge market opportunity, estimating the 


probability Claros ultimately gets to $20 million in sales at around 50% with “maybe a 


5% chance they could get to $100 million in sales.”
12


  He also thought that if it were “a 


big market opportunity, people would have jumped on this a long time ago.”  It is now 


rather clear to us how Opko acquired this technology for just $30 million in a competitive 


auction.  Even if they managed to one day get the machine working, it is hard to see how 


it would have material value in the context of a $5 billion market capitalization company. 


5. Opko’s 4Kscore™ exploratory prostate cancer screening test (licensed for no 


upfront payment in 2012) has serious issues, has seen numerous delays and is 


unlikely to amount to much revenue.  In January 2012, Opko acquired a license to an 


exploratory prostate cancer screening test called 4Kscore™ from a small group out of 


Finland called Arctic Partners for no upfront payment.  The basis for excitement in this 


test was data presented in a journal by individuals associated with Arctic Partners 


showing the test’s ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies.  However, an accompanying 


editorial in the same issue raised serious questions around the value of such a test, 


pointing out that “…24% of all cancers and 14% of high-grade cancers would be 


missed.”  The test has been significantly delayed and after a 2012 launch in the U.K. and 


promises of a 2013 launch in the U.S., the test has not produced any material revenues.  


Furthermore, Opko is planning to launch the test out of a small lab it acquired in the U.S. 


with a tiny sales force and any patients using the test will likely have to pay out of pocket 


given insurance reimbursement issues. 


6. Rayaldy (aka CTAP101), the lead candidate of Cytochroma (acquired for $100 


million in stock in 2013), faces serious obstacles and is unlikely to generate enough 


sales to result in material value for Opko shareholders.  Rayaldy is targeting patients 


with secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) in Stages 3 and 4 of chronic kidney disease 


(CKD).  Patients are currently treated with over-the-counter vitamin D which can cost

just $5 per bottle or vitamin D analogs like Hectorol and Zemplar that both go generic 


next year and will likely see their price plummet. 


We have spoken with numerous nephrologists who treat patients with SHPT and the tone 


was skeptical.  For example, Dr. Jeffrey Giullian, a veteran nephrologist who has about 


500 CKD patients in his clinic, had the following to say when we discussed Rayaldy 


(CTAP101) and its market potential with him:
13





“In Stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease, you don’t really see the side effects of giving 


OTC vitamin D … there’s the rub ... you can give OTC or calciferol without the side 


effects.  It’s later when the kidney is struggling that the nutritional vitamin D causes the 


side effects, but at that point we’re switching over to the analogs [such as Zemplar or 


Hectorol].  So it’s hard for me to see a niche for CTAP101 … in early stages of treatment 


you can use nutritional vitamin D and in later stages you want to use Zemplar or 


Hectorol…  I would think they [Cytochroma] are overstating the market opportunity…  I 


have probably 500 [CKD] patients in my clinic … maybe 4 or 5 of them could benefit 


from switching to CTAP101. The issue is this is a new drug that is just barely better than 


existing treatments that are over-the-counter and cheap. So would it justify a huge 


difference in cost, probably not.” 


Even the bullish Jefferies analyst concluded after speaking with nephrologists there was 


not a “significant unmet need” in treating SHPT patients:   


“Nephrologists note that for vitamin D insufficiency, patients with SHPT can easily take 


OTC vitamin D supplements, along with generic vitamin D analog, rather than paying a 


premium for new vitamin D analogs.”
 14





We believe Rayaldy is worth at most $500 million or just $1 per Opko share, and at this 


aggressive valuation, it would represent a value of five times what Opko paid to acquire 


Cytochroma just a few months ago. 


7. Prolor Biotech’s (acquired in 2013 for $480 million in stock) lead drug candidate 


will likely be beaten to market by LG Life Sciences and its own financial advisors 


valued the company below Opko’s purchase price.
15


  In April 2013, Opko announced 


the acquisition of a Frost-backed public company called Prolor Biotech (“Prolor”) for 


$480 million in stock.  Prolor’s lead product is a Phase 3 long-acting human growth 


hormone.  Unfortunately for Opko, Prolor has been beaten to the punch by LG Life 


Sciences, who will likely have a nearly identical drug on the market next year, before 


Prolor even hopes to complete its studies.  A read of the merger proxy reveals that 


                                                           
13


 Per discussion on November 6, 2013 
14


 See Jefferies note from March 19, 2013 (page 3) 
15


 Oppenheimer valued Prolor at $3.32-4.23 per share (~40-53% discount to Opko’s $7.00 per share purchase price);

another company (likely Teva) passed on an acquisition of Prolor after conducting due 


diligence.
16


  Furthermore, the proxy shows that Prolor’s own financial advisors valued 


the company at roughly half of Opko’s purchase price and valued the lead Phase 3 drug at 


only $131 million to $174 million, or just 2.6% to 3.4% of Opko’s current fully-diluted 


market capitalization.
17





8. Opko’s CEO, Dr. Phillip Frost, has a history of close financial ties with what we 


believe are two serial stock promoters, who have both been the subject of several 


lawsuits, and the Company’s former CFO curiously was the Treasurer of a Frost-


backed penny stock (while he was CFO at Opko), which went on to merge with a 


Chinese company that turned out to be a fraud.  While Dr. Frost has earned the 


admiration of the investment community after selling two companies (Key 


Pharmaceuticals and Ivax Corporation) for incredibly large gains, we think there is 


another side of his career that should be of great concern anyone investing in Opko.  Dr. 


Frost has a disturbingly large number of connections to what we believe are two serial 


stock promoters that have each been the subject of multiple lawsuits, Barry Honig and 


Michael Brauser (who together run an entity called Marlin Capital).  We have counted 16 


different penny stocks in which Frost, Honig and Brauser have invested together in recent 


years, including entities in which Opko is directly involved.  In fact, the business address 


listed for Honig and Brauser, 4400 Biscayne Blvd., is owned by Dr. Frost and is also the 


offices of Opko Health, Ladenburg Thalmann (where Dr. Frost is Chairman) and 


numerous other companies in which Frost, Honig and/or Brauser are involved (including 


MusclePharm, BioZone, SafeStitch Medical, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems and 


others).   In fact, Barry Honig’s office is listed as being in the exact same suite (Suite 


850) of 4400 Biscayne Blvd. as Dr. Frost’s Frost Gamma Investments Trust.
18





Dr. Frost has also been involved in plenty of other penny stocks beyond those with any 


apparent Honig or Brauser involvement.  Perhaps the most remarkable situation is that of 


Protalix BioTherapeutics (PLX), which was merged with Orthodontix (traded on the pink 


sheets under OTIX) in August 2006.  Simultaneously, Frost and Glenn Halpryn (who 


together owned a majority of Orthodontix) agreed to invest $15 million in Protalix.  At 


that time, Frost and his trusted lieutenant, Dr. Jane Hsiao (who is the current Vice 


Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Opko) joined the Protalix board.  Interestingly, 


Eli Hurvitz was the Chairman of Protalix at the time and was also the Chairman of Teva 


at that point.  Amazingly, on October 24, 2007, Protalix announced a 10 million share 


offering at $5 per share vs. the prior close of $36.06 per share, an astounding 86% 


discount.  The next day, the stock fell 83%, “wiping away $2.07 billion in market value.”

Dr. Frost and Hsiao, who had joined the board on 12/31/06, quit the Protalix board after 


the company’s implosion, with the press release citing “personal reasons.”   


If all of this is not concerning enough, consider the following facts related to Opko’s 


former CFO.  On July 16, 2012, long-time Frost colleague Rao Uppaluri retired from his 


role as CFO of Opko and was replaced by Juan Rodriguez.  We find it strange that 


Uppaluri was listed as Treasurer and Director of Ideation Acquisition Corp, a publicly-


traded company, as recently as a 10-K filed on March 20, 2009 when at that same time, 


he was the CFO of Opko.
19


  But, Uppaluri’s bio in the Opko 10-K filed around the same 


time only discloses that he was on the board of Ideation (not that he was Treasurer).
20





Also, Dr. Frost served as the Chairman of the Board for Ideation at that time.  Ideation 


ultimately merged with a company in China, changing its name to SearchMedia.  


SearchMedia was ultimately discovered to be a fraud, with its auditor KPMG resigning 


from the account. 


9. The only significant sell-side Opko research coverage comes from Ladenburg 


Thalmann (Dr. Frost’s company) and Jefferies (the Company’s lead underwriter 


and M&A advisor), both of which have repeatedly been way too aggressive.  


Ladenburg’s initiation report in 2011 claimed the market opportunity for Opko’s 


Alzheimer’s test “could approach $3 billion annually.”
21


  We now know this test appears 


to be a failure.  The same analyst projected Opko will be cash flow positive in 2014 and 


may not need additional capital (of course, Opko losses have mounted since and the 


Company has already raised capital through convertible notes).   


The Jefferies analyst valued Claros at $1 billion in her price target calculation despite 


Opko having just bought Claros a month earlier for $30 million in a competitive 


auction.
22


  Even after acknowledging delays in key programs (including the Alzheimer’s 


test which she said could generate more than $800 million in sales), she did not make any 


changes to her price target (upping the value of other projects to make up the difference). 


In subsequent reports, she pointed out delays in 4Kscore™ and Claros, yet she actually 


increased her price target. 


10. Opko’s CEO regularly purchases shares in Opko (which is commonly stated as the 


predominant reason to buy the stock), but we believe this is a red herring.  Dr. Frost 


has consistently purchased Opko shares in the open market and many investors seem to 


be buying the stock at any price based on this fact alone.  The logic seems to go, “if Phil 


is buying, surely he must know something.”  Investors have been trained to follow insider 


buying, and we believe Dr. Frost has likely taken advantage of that fact to draw in

unsuspecting retail buyers who don’t fully understand what they own.  We imagine Dr. 


Frost at this point realizes he is effectively “pot committed” in Opko, and if he stops 


buying shares in the open market, confidence would likely disappear and the stock could 


plummet (his stake is also worth an astonishing $1.9 billion, which is a lot for anyone to 


fight hard to hold on to… not to mention what must be a keen interest in maintaining the 


support and trust of his followers).
23





Consider this:  Frost has engaged in insider purchases at Opko for years going back to 


2007, and it is rather obvious now in hindsight that he didn’t “know something” after all, 


since nearly everything the Company was working on throughout that period has been a 


failure or disappointment (the Company’s main assets today were mostly acquired just in 


the past year).  Perhaps even more importantly, shareholders might want to consider that 


for every share that Dr. Frost has purchased in the open market, the Company has issued 


nearly six more to finance acquisitions and raise capital over the years (fully-diluted 


shares have increased from 201 million in 2007 to 470 million today) – not the behavior 


we would expect from a company that believes its shares are a good value. 


11. After years of shareholder dilution, Opko’s market capitalization has swelled to $5 


billion despite all of the above issues.  Opko’s fully-diluted share count has expanded 


from 201 million fully-diluted shares immediately following the Company’s formation in 


2007 to 470 million fully-diluted shares (the calculation is provided later in this report).   


As Opko’s share price has increased from around $4 per share two years ago to over $11 


per share today, the Company’s market capitalization has soared from under $1 billion to 


$5 billion in just two years. 


We draw the following conclusions from the foregoing assertions: 


1. With a run-rate operating loss now exceeding $100 million annually (with Prolor 


Biotech losses included), we believe it is unlikely shareholders will ever see a profit 


out of Opko.  For six straight years, Opko has lost money despite having worked on over 


twenty projects that were supposed to deliver financial results over that time frame.  In 


recent years, the losses have increased sharply as the Company has continued to ratchet 


up its acquisition efforts.  The realistic revenue opportunities of Opko (please see our 


individual discussions on each product) are unlikely to cover its ever-mounting losses. 


2. We believe the shares are worth 75% to 100% less than where they are currently 


trading.  It is our belief that Opko will never report a profit, which would render an 


ultimate price for the stock of $0 per share.  Even under an incredibly optimistic scenario 


whereby the 4Kscore™, Cytochroma and Prolor Biotech were each worth $500 million 


                                                           
23


 Based on an estimated 172.8mm diluted shares beneficially owned by Frost, The Frost Group, LLC and Frost 


Gamma Investments Trust, pro forma for the Prolor acquisition and including all warrants, options and convertible 


debt based on the treasury method; based on latest 13D plus subsequent open market share purchases 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312513368065/d599643dsc13da.htm
8 





and all other assets generated enough money to cover operating losses (thereby netting to 


a value of zero), the stock would only be worth $3 per share, or nearly 75% below the 


current price. 


3. We believe Opko’s stock has become little more than a day trading vehicle.  Opko’s 


stock has over 100 message board postings on Yahoo! Finance daily… that is five times 


more than Johnson & Johnson, Pfizer, Merck and Eli Lily combined.  The stock is 


frequently cited on CNBC’s Mad Money (which is widely watched by retail investors) 


and there have been 32 positive write-ups posted on Seeking Alpha in 2013 alone.   No 


institution owns more than 3% of the stock and the largest institutional shareholders 


(Vanguard and Blackrock) appear to be index funds.  Our experience with stocks 


possessing these characteristics indicates they are very fragile and quite frequently 


expose shareholders to large, sudden price declines. 


4. Opko’s float has expanded considerably in recent months, making it less likely that 


the shares will be artificially inflated in the future.  We estimate the free float of Opko 


has expanded from $650 million one year ago to $2.5 billion today due to (1) the all-


stock acquisitions of Cytochroma, Prost-Data and Prolor Biotech, (2) the partial early 


conversion of convertible debt into equity and (3) the sharp rise in the share price.  


Furthermore, the stock has been added to the TASE 25 index (Tel Aviv) and saw its 


weighting in the Russell 2000 increase at the end of August, which in turn have increased 


the shares that are available for borrow (as index funds generally lend out their shares).   


As a result, Opko shares can now be borrowed by short sellers at a current annual rate of 


<10% whereas they were nearly impossible to borrow over the course of the past year.   


Historically, Opko’s stock was fairly easy to impact with insider share purchases and 


retail investor influence given its tiny float.  We believe Dr. Frost’s buying combined 


with intense retail buying and unrealistically bullish analyst research had an outsized 


impact on Opko’s stock price historically, but now with the current free float having 


more than tripled in value over the past year, we believe it is much more likely that 


Opko’s shares will reflect reality in the future. 


B.)  A Dizzying History Of Deals And Disappointment: Other Than Stock 


Promotion, We Can’t Find Much Opko Has Done Well 


As shown below, since its formation until the end of 2012, we have found 30 products or 


investments that Opko has claimed to be working on and 25 of those appear to have ended in 


delay, disappointment or total failure.  Only 5 relatively minor products appear to be on track.  


Opko has engaged in so many random deals and acquisitions that it must be nearly impossible 


for shareholders to even know what they own any more.

Below is a year-by-year account of all the deals in which Opko has been involved (to our 


knowledge).  In nearly every case, the opportunity initially sounded exciting, but the vast 


majority ended in utter disappointment.  Astonishingly, nearly all of the recent investor 


excitement seems directed at assets that were only acquired in the last year for a fairly modest 


sum… $5 billion of market capitalization for a company that produced nothing for five years and 


then made a few relatively minor deals in late 2012 and 2013. 


2007 


Opko was formed in 2007 via a reverse merger engineered by Dr. Phillip Frost (Chairman of 


Teva Pharmaceuticals and investment bank Ladenburg Thalmann) involving three companies 


called Froptix, Acuity and eXegenics.  Froptix and Acuity were both working on certain 


treatments for eye disease and eXegenics was a public shell with no operations.   On June 8, 


2007, the Company changed its name to Opko Health.  From the time of the merger until 2009,

Opko was focused on the eye market, pursuing more than ten different compounds, none of 


which met with any success.  In the spring of 2007, Opko acquired a 33% stake in a company 


called Ophthalmic Technologies (OTI) for $5 million in cash.  In November, they acquired the 


remaining 67% for $10 million in stock.
24


  Four years later, in September 2011, Opko would 


ultimately sell the business for $17.5 million.  


In December 2007, the Frost Group (controlled by Dr. Frost) invested $20 million into Opko’s 


stock at a 40% discount to the 5-day average share price.  “We are pleased to make this 


investment during this important Phase of Opko's product development efforts, with our lead 


drug candidate bevasiranib in Phase III trials and the recent launch of our breakthrough 


diagnostic imaging system," Dr. Frost said at the time.  Those important product development 


efforts ultimately resulted in the complete failure of bevasiranib with Opko’s decision to 


terminate the Phase III trial in March 2009.   


In addition to the products discussed above, at the time of its 2007 10-K, Opko was working on 


numerous other products.  Here is a list of those products and where each one currently stands:
25





 Civamide, a phase I/II treatment for dry eye  Never commercialized; last mentioned by 


the Company in an investor presentation in November 2009 


 ACU-HHY-011, a pre-clinical treatment for Wet AMD and Diabetic Retinopathy/DME 


 Not mentioned again after the 2009 10-K 


 ACU-XSP-001, a pre-clinical treatment for Allergy and Inflammation  Not mentioned 


again after the 2008 10-K 


 Wound Dressing, late-stage research for post-surgical wound healing  Not mentioned 


again after the 2008 10-K 


 ACU-HTR-028, a pre-clinical wound-healing-Antifrobtic  Not mentioned again after 


the 2008 10-K 


 Dry-AMD compound, a pre-clinical treatment for AMD  Not mentioned again after the 


2009 10-K 


2008 


In February 2008, Opko and a now-defunct penny stock named Pathogenics (PTGN) announced 


the publication of preclinical data demonstrating the potential utility of their formulation for the 


treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis, a serious eye infection.  After this press release and the 


2007 10-K filed in March 2008, Opko never mentions this treatment again.  In fact, the 8-K filed

in February 2008 for this press release was the last SEC filing ever made by Pathogenics and the 


company’s website doesn’t even appear to exist anymore.  


In March 2008, Opko announced it had received a warning letter from the FDA finding 


deficiencies in record-keeping and reporting systems for OTI (which it acquired in 2007).  In 


May 2008, Opko acquired a company called Vidus Ocular for $1.3 million in stock that was 


developing a glaucoma drainage device called Aquashunt.  A clinical trial began in January 2009 


but nothing appears to have ever come of it.  In June 2008, Opko acquired a license to a “novel” 


small molecule for the treatment of viral conjunctivitis called Doxovir (subsequently, this 


product has not been mentioned in any SEC filing since mid-2010).  In August 2008, Frost 


Group made a $15 million investment in Opko, again at a 40% discount to the 5-day average 


share price.  In October 2008, Opko acquired exclusive rights for the treatments of allergic 


conditions of the eye called Budesonide.  That drug was not even mentioned in a single SEC 


filing after the 2008 10-K and appears to have quietly failed to make any progress.   


In addition to the previously discussed opportunities, at the time of its 2008 10-K, Opko was 


working on two additional products.  Here is the list and where each currently stands:
26





 OPK-HVB-004, a pre-clinical treatment for wet AMD/DR/DME   Not mentioned again 


after the 2009 10-K 


 OPK-HVB-010, a pre-clinical treatment for wet AMD/DR/DME  Not mentioned again 


after the 2009 10-K 


2009 


In March 2009, the Company’s main product, bevasiranib (a treatment for macular 


degeneration), failed to reach feasibility and Opko’s stock fell to just $0.60 and its market 


capitalization fell from a peak of roughly $600 million down to a low of $200 million.
27


  In June 


2009, Opko completed a private placement at $1 per share (prior close was $1.20 per share).  


None of the original main eye treatments were ever to be heard from again. 


Opko then shifted strategies and began acquiring a large number of early stage medical 


companies.  In June 2009, Opko invested in a private company called Sorrento Therapeutics 


(SRNE) with a technology for the generation of fully human monoclonal antibodies.  "The 


therapeutic antibody market is experiencing a significant growth phase and is one of the fastest 


growing pharmaceutical market segments," said Dr. Frost at the time. "Opko is pleased to secure 


a stake in this cutting edge company.”  After the Opko investment, the thinly-traded Sorrento 


saw its stock rise as high as $75 per share in April of 2010 before crashing back down to its 


current price below $9 per share (with Opko selling shares regularly since August 2013).  In June 


2009, Opko invested in a company called Cocrystal Discovery that was focused on antiviral

drugs.   "Cocrystal… is moving quickly to fill an important void in the therapeutic 


armamentarium," said Dr. Frost at the time. "Opko is pleased to work with Cocrystal's world-


class scientific team to create a new key player in the world of pharmaceuticals."  In the more 


than four years since Opko made its investment, there has been little apparent progress at 


Cocrystal as disclosed by Opko and the book value of the investment is just $2.5 million.
28





In June 2009, Opko acquired a license for a new platform that could possibly be used to diagnose 


Alzheimer’s disease.  This became the Company’s lead asset in 2011 and 2012 and is discussed 


in detail later below.   In July 2009, Opko entered into a license with Academia Sinica in Taipei 


to develop proteins against influenza.  "The entire Opko team is excited to be working with 


Academia Sinica and Dr. Wong to develop products which deal with important unmet medical 


needs," said Phillip Frost, M.D., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Opko. "Academia 


Sinica has long enjoyed a reputation for being the most prestigious academic institution in 


Taiwan and we, at Opko, are honored to have been selected to help translate the fruits of its 


scientific work into products to prevent and treat serious medical problems,” said Dr. Frost at the 


time.  In the more than four years since this announcement, there has been no apparent progress 


on this program.   


In October 2009, Opko acquired a Chilean pharmaceutical distribution company for $16 million 


in cash.  In October 2009, Opko acquired a compound from Schering-Plough called 


Rolapitant.  The product was subsequently sold to Tesaro (TSRO) in December 2010 for an 


upfront payment of $6 million (plus milestones and royalties).
29


  Phase 3 data for Rolapitant is 


scheduled to be released soon.  However, Rolapitant would face other competing treatments and 


our discussions with physicians indicate that there might not be a need for this product.   


The 2009 Opko 10-K also mentioned a treatment for chronic cough called SCH 900978 that was 


in Phase II development.
30


  After not being mentioned by Opko since a June 2011 investor 


presentation, the product has suddenly re-emerged in Opko’s June 2013 investor presentation as 


part of its clinical pipeline with indications for not only chronic cough, but overactive bladder 


and major depression too (but then was once again removed in Opko’s September 2013 investor 


presentation). 


2010 


In February 2010, Opko acquired a Mexican pharmaceutical distribution company and 


announced a collaboration with a Mexican research center to develop vaccines for flu, dengue 


fever and West Nile virus (there has been no further mention of these efforts for the past 2.5 


years).  In November 2010, Opko invested in an antibody drug discovery biotech company called 


Fabrus LLC.  “Fabrus is using its proprietary antibody screening and engineering approach to

discover promising lead compounds against several important oncology targets,” said Dr. Frost 


at the time.  “We believe the Fabrus discovery approach is novel, rapid, provides valuable data at 


very early discovery stages, and can screen multiple targets or pathways in parallel. We are 


pleased to secure a stake in this cutting edge company, and we look forward to rapidly 


developing important drug candidates."  It has now been three years and Fabrus does not appear 


to have “rapidly” developed anything and the carrying value of Opko’s investment equals just 


$650,000.
31





2011 


In January 2011, Opko announced it was collaborating with Bristol Myers Squibb on its blood 


test for Alzheimer’s.  In Opko’s 2011 10-K, it described the Alzheimer’s test as its “most 


advanced molecular diagnostic test” for its “lead program.”
32


  While we will later discuss in 


detail the history of this test, this program about which the Company was most excited has been 


a complete failure and is barely even discussed today.  Then, in February 2011, Opko acquired a 


company called CURNA for $11 million that was working on the discovery of new drugs for a 


variety of illnesses.
33


  "Opko is pleased to acquire CURNA," said Dr. Frost at the time. "We 


believe CURNA's unique technology may be important for treating diseases in which increased 


levels of specific proteins are important, such as APOA1 to increase HDL levels to prevent heart 


disease, and genetic disorders in which higher levels of specific enzymes or other proteins may 


be beneficial or curative."  This acquisition appears to be making limited progress, with Opko’s 


most recent investor presentation describing its AntagoNAT platform as “preclinical.”   


In March 2011, Opko completed a public offering at $3.75 per share, raising net proceeds of 


$104.8 million with Jefferies as the lead bookrunner (Jefferies would subsequently initiate 


coverage of Opko with a Buy rating in November 2011).
34


  In August 2011, Opko invested in a 


company called Neovasc (TSXV:  NVC) to develop “unique” devices to treat cardiovascular 


disease.  So far in 2013, Neovasc has generated operating losses of C$4.8 million and has a book 


value of just C$7.4 million.
35


  In October 2011, Opko acquired Claros Diagnostics, a company 


working on a small blood analyzer.  This has become one of Opko’s main assets and is discussed 


further below.  In December 2011, Opko acquired FineTech, an Israeli manufacturer of active 


pharmaceutical ingredients that are then sold to other drug companies.  This business had book 


value of $10.9 million and was generating around $8 million in annual revenues at the time of 


acquisition.

2012 


In January 2012, Opko acquired a license (for no upfront payment) from a group out of Finland 


called Arctic Partners for an exploratory prostate cancer screening test.  This has also become 


one of Opko’s main assets and will be discussed further below.  Also in January 2012, Opko 


acquired a second Chilean pharmaceutical distribution business for $4 million.  In February 


2012, Opko invested in a small cap stock called ChromaDex (CDXC) and acquired a license for 


the distribution of its products in Latin America.  Also in February 2012, Opko invested in a 


small cap stock called BioZone Pharmaceuticals (BZNE).  Since that time, BioZone’s stock has 


fallen by more than 80%.
37


  In March 2012, Opko and the Scripps Institute announced a license 


agreement for a “novel” compound that blocks brain cell destruction in Parkinson’s Disease that 


at this point does not seem to be making much progress.  In June 2012, Opko acquired a stake in 


a private Israeli company producing a hepatitis B vaccine.  In July 2012, Opko entered into a 


license agreement with a Mexican professor of ophthalmology to treat macular edema, an 


opportunity that was never again mentioned by Opko.  In August 2012, Opko acquired a Spanish 


company called Farmadiet Group for a total of $16 million.
38


  In October 2012, Opko acquired 


Prost-Data for $40 million, a CLIA lab to support the launch of the test acquired from Arctic 


Partners.
39


  In December 2012, Opko acquired a Brazilian pharmaceutical company, which the 


Company believed would help facilitate “the near-term commercialization in the Brazilian 


market of our 4Kscore™ [test].”  One year has passed and the “near-term” Brazilian launch of 


the 4Kscore™ test has yet to happen. 


2013   


In January 2013, Opko acquired Cytochroma whose lead drug, Rayaldy, is seeking to treat 


secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney disease.  This has become one of 


Opko’s main assets and is discussed further below.  In March 2013, Opko invested in a microcap 


public company called RXi (RXII) that is working on RNAi-targeted technologies and also sold 


certain assets to RXi.  Since the transaction was announced, RXi’s share price has fallen almost 


30% and the company’s market cap is below $40 million.
40


  In April 2013, Opko acquired a 


stake in OAO Pharmsynthez (MICEX: LIFE), a small Russian life science company.  In April 


2013, Opko announced the acquisition of Prolor Biotech, a Frost-backed public company 


working on a Phase 3 long-acting human growth hormone.  This also is considered one of 


Opko’s main assets today and will be discussed further below.  Most recently, in October 2013, 


Opko made an investment in a private company called Zebra Biologics, where Dr. Richard 


Lerner (an Opko board member) is also a director and founder of the company.

C.)  Poor Financial Results… Yet A Soaring Market Capitalization 


Opko has lost money every year since it was formed, with losses increasing to $44 million in the 


first nine months of 2013. 


OPERATING LOSSES 





Other than the cash raised from investors, Opko has no net tangible assets.  Tangible book value, 


excluding cash, amounted to negative $0.41 per share as of September 30, 2013: 


9/30/13 Shareholders’ Equity $871 million  


Less:  Goodwill - $222 million  


Less:  Other Intangibles (including in-process R&D) - $871 million  


Plus: Carrying Value of Convertible Notes + $209 million 


Less: Cash Raised from Investors - $181 million 


Tangible Book Value Excluding Cash Raised - $194 million

As a result of the significant increase in shares outstanding and the sharp recent rise in Opko’s 


shares, the Company’s fully-diluted market capitalization has increased from under $1 billion 


just two years ago to a current level of $5 billion (470 million shares x $11.10 per share price). 


FULLY-DILUTED MARKET CAPITALIZATION 





D.)  Latin American Drug Distribution:  The Majority Of Revenues… But No 


Profit And No Real Value 


In 2009 and 2010, Opko acquired two Latin American generic drug distribution companies for 


$20 million ($0.04 per Opko share), forming the basis for this business.
41


  The base Opko 


business saw organic revenue growth of less than 1% in 2012, with gross profit dollars declining 


over 3%.
42,43


  Although this business has historically accounted for the majority of Opko’s 


revenues, it is tiny and appears to be challenged, with an annualized gross profit of only around 


$10 million.
44


  After a reasonable allocation of SG&A, it is unlikely this business even makes a 


profit.   


No matter how one views Opko’s distribution business, it does not have any material value to 


Opko’s shareholders in the context of 470 million fully-diluted shares outstanding and a $5 


billion fully-diluted market capitalization. 


                                                           
41


 Mexico operations acquired in February 2010 for $3.5mm ($1.5mm cash and $2mm stock); Chile operations 


acquired in October 2009 for $16mm cash (see page 60-61 of 2010 10-K) 
42


 Calculated as 2012 revenues of $47.0mm less $6.1mm from Farmadiet acquisition less $7.1mm for FineTech 


acquisition less $5.0mm from ALS acquisition and $0.6mm from SciGen acquisition (June 2012) for 2012 “organic” 


revenues of $28.2mm vs 2011 reported revenues of $28mm (see 2012 10-K, page 56) 
43


 Calculated as 2012 gross profit of $19.2mm less $3.4mm from Farmadiet acquisition less $5.4mm from FineTech 


acquisition for “organic” gross profit of $10.4mm vs 2011 reported gross profit of $10.7mm (2012 10-K, page 56) 
44


 Estimated 2012 gross profit for “core” business of $10.4mm based on total Opko 2012 gross profit of $19.2mm 


less $3.4mm contribution from Farmadiet acquisition less $5.4mm contribution from FineTech acquisition (see 


pages 56 and 68 of 2012 10-K)

E.)  Exploratory Alzheimer’s Diagnostic Test: The Mostly Highly Touted 


Opko Asset Just One Year Ago! 


The Alzheimer’s Test essentially was the source of all investor interest in Opko in 2012 with the 


analyst at Ladenburg Thalmann predicting that the market could “approach $3 billion 


annually.”
45


  This test was acquired for what appears to have been essentially no upfront 


consideration in a license agreement with the University of Texas-Southwestern in 2009.  The 


basic idea was a blood test that could diagnose Alzheimer’s (currently the only definitive 


diagnosis is autopsy).  Dr. Thomas Kodadek, originally at the University of Texas-Southwestern, 


but now at the Scripps Institute (where he devotes 20% of his time to Opko as a consultant), 


developed the idea from a study he conducted of six patients with advanced Alzheimer’s and six 


healthy patients.  He found specific antibodies that were prevalent in the Alzheimer’s group only, 


which would conceivably allow for the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s. 


We have always doubted that the Alzheimer’s test would ever have significant commercial 


value.  The study done by Dr. Kodadek was very preliminary and importantly, did not measure 


Alzheimer’s patients without clinical symptoms.  It is very unclear whether the antibodies 


discovered even exist during earlier stages of the disease (if not, the test would be rendered fairly 


useless).  Further, intellectual property remains uncertain, with a similar study conducted by a 


doctor at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey.  Even if the test were 


successful, there are likely other antibodies associated with Alzheimer’s that could be used as the 


basis of competing tests.  As stated by a spokesman for the Alzheimer’s Association in August 


2011, “Many labs are looking at this. They are all in the very preliminary, very early stages.”  


Also, the test’s value would likely be limited in the absence of an effective treatment for 


Alzheimer’s disease.  By Dr. Kodadek’s own admission in a January 2011 interview, “it’s 


unclear whether people would want to know a couple of years ahead of time they are going to get 


Alzheimer’s if they can’t do anything about it.” 


As recently as the 2011 10-K, the Company called the Alzheimer’s test its “lead program” and 


stated the following regarding commercialization:  “We are currently conducting a broader 


validation study that we expect to be completed by mid-2012 and we expect to begin marketing 


our test for Alzheimer’s disease in 2013.”
 46,47


  As it turns out, the Alzheimer’s test has not 


proven to be as good as the initial study (which, as mentioned, was based on just six Alzheimer’s 


patients).  The Company continued touting the test and in a September 2012 article, Frost argued 


they are still working to improve the sensitivity “in various ways” and think they will have a 


“valuable test.”  Today, the Company appears to have moved on, downplaying the test’s 


significance.  Again, this was basically the whole company one year ago.

The Jefferies analyst recently noted the Company “maintains its work on Alzheimer’s disease 


and cancer … however, there does not appear to be significant progress for potential launches of 


the Dx as previously expected.”
48


   Previously, the Jefferies analyst assigned $3 per share ($1 


billion at the time) to this business.
49


  Today, it has been removed from her net asset value 


calculation given the test’s apparent failure (and the value has been made up by increasing the 


value of the other businesses).

F.)  Claros Diagnostics:  Coming To A Doctor’s Office Near You In 2012… 


No, 2013… Make That 2014… Just Wait Until Q3 2015  


Opko acquired Claros Diagnostics in October 2011 in an auction process for $30 million ($10 


million in cash, $20 million in stock and up to an additional $19 million in stock subject to 


achievement of certain milestones).
51


  Per its financial statements as of December 31, 2010, 


Claros had total assets of just $557,151 and had spent a cumulative $4.9 million on R&D since 


inception.  


The basic concept was to have a small blood test system that can be used to run tests in-house 


during a visit to the doctor without having to wait for results from a lab.  There are considerable 


challenges to broad adoption for this system.  Our research has indicated that a lot of doctors do 


not want to deal with the paperwork associated with in-house lab testing.  Also, as one doctor 


told us, “the reimbursement needs to be more lucrative to spend 10 minutes on lab work vs. 10 


minutes with another patient.”
52


  Another problem is having a large enough test offering in order 


to incentivize people to invest in your platform.  According to a different doctor we spoke with, 


you “absolutely need to get a lot of tests on these things before people will adopt. They could 


launch with just the PSA [prostate specific antigen] but won’t get a lot of uptake.”
53





Two full years since it was acquired, the product seems to be going nowhere.  In June 2010 (even 


before the acquisition by Opko), Claros was “preparing for the European launch” of its point-of-


care prostate test but it has generated no sales at this point.  In December 2011, Opko put out a 


press release stating that they were commencing a multi-center clinical study of point-of-care test 


for PSA. They also stated “Opko intends to submit its application to the U.S. Food and Drug 


Administration for approval of the assay in 2012.”  At a Lazard conference in November 2011, 


former Claros CEO Mike Magliochetti (who has since left Opko), stated that they would launch 


the product in Q1 2012 in Europe and hopefully by end of year 2012 in the U.S.

As soon as the 2011 10-K was released, the timing began to slip: 


“…we intend to launch the PSA test in Europe in the second half of 2012… We intend to 


submit our application to the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for clearance 


of the PSA test in 2012 and expect to begin marketing the test in the U.S. in 2013.”
55





And then one year later, things slipped again… in the 2012 10-K, Opko includes a complete cut 


and paste of the prior year’s language but with all of the dates pushed back exactly one year: 


“…we intend to launch the PSA test in Europe in the second half of 2013. We intend to 


submit our application to the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) for clearance 


of the PSA test and expect to begin marketing the test in the U.S. in 2014.”
56





At an appearance on CNBC’s Mad Money on January 28, 2013, Jim Cramer asked Dr. Frost 


about the Claros PSA test, to which he responded, “We’re further along but we want to get it 


perfect because it’s so big so we’re going to do another trial and I would predict, trying to be a 


little more conservative, that it will come to market at the end of the year.”
57


  It is now the end of 


the year and there is no test on the market so this proved to not be “conservative” enough. 


The Company’s September 2013 presentation discussed initial Claros product offerings and said 


that for the PSA test that “U.S. FDA expected 2014,” which would seem to imply a 2015 U.S. 


launch: 





A later slide in the presentation seemed to show the PSA launch in the U.S. ranging anywhere 


from Q4 2014 to Q3 2015:

And these September slides seemed to be later than what was indicated in the June slides 


presented at the Jefferies conference, which would indicate a Q2 2014 PSA test launch for 


Claros: 





So what has happened that has led to these problems? According to our discussions with the 


Company and a physician closely tracking the progress of Claros,
 
the product isn’t working as it 


has a high failure rate.

cases, you simply get an “error” reading with no result at all.  Even the Company admitted that 


they stopped the PSA trial on the Claros due to error messages and stated that they “need more 


robust manufacturing.”  In June 2013, they said they would start a new, six-month trial in the 


“next few months.”
60





Even assuming they can fix the problems with the Claros machine, one physician close to Claros 


did not see a huge market opportunity.  He believed the probability Claros ultimately gets to $20 


million in sales is around 50% and that there is “maybe a 5% chance they could get to $100 


million in sales.”  He also thought that if it were “a big market opportunity, people would have 


jumped on this a long time ago.”
61





It is now rather clear to us how Opko acquired this technology for just $30 million in a 


competitive auction.  Even if they managed to one day get the machine working, it is hard to see 


how it would have material value in the context of a $5 billion market capitalization company. 


G.)  4Kscore™ Exploratory Prostate Cancer Screening Test:  “…24% Of All 


Cancers And 14% Of High-Grade Cancers Would Be Missed” 


In January 2012, Opko put out a press release announcing the “acquisition of an exclusive 


license from a small group called Arctic Partners Ab Oy (Turku, Finland) for two biomarkers in 


the kallikrein family which, used together with prostate specific antigen (PSA), can reduce the 


need for prostate biopsies by over 50%.”  Then in March 2012, there was another press release 


where the Company announced the exercise of a right of first refusal “to secure additional 


proprietary information, patents, know-how, property and technology associated with time-


resolved fluorescence detection technology, which is directly applicable to the novel prostate 


cancer biomarkers.”  


Opko appears to have paid nothing upfront for this license.  As background on the technology, 


individuals associated with Arctic Partners presented data in May of 2010 (roughly two years 


before it was acquired by Opko) showing the so-called Four-Kallikrein panel’s (hence 4K) 


ability to reduce unnecessary biopsies.  However, an accompanying editorial in the same issue 


raised serious questions around the value of such a test.  Key arguments of the editorial include:  


 “while use of the kallikrein panel advocated in the study may reduce the number of 


biopsies performed, it also seems to reduce overall cancer detection”; 


 “…24% of all cancers and 14% of high-grade cancers would be missed”; 


 “…high-grade cancers might actually be missed with more frequency than the authors 


estimate”; and 


 “…it seems unlikely that a strategy which misses some high-grade and potentially 


aggressive tumors would actually optimize screening.”

From a more common sense standpoint, one may want to ask:  if this test is such an incredible 


breakthrough, then why did no one attempt to commercialize it for two years after the study was 


published?  And, why was Opko able to sign a licensing deal for seemingly no consideration? 


In May 2012, Opko signed an agreement with International Health Technology (IHT) to offer the 


4Kscore™ test in the UK, Ireland, Sweden and Denmark.  In October 2012, Opko issued a press 


release announcing that IHT had “launched the Opko 4Kscore™ in Europe as part of IHT's 


ProstateCheck™ program.” While technically correct, Opko appears to be overstating the true 


market coverage.  Opko’s 2012 10-K indicates that the test was only launched in the UK (not all 


of Europe):  “In October 2012, our strategic partner, International Health Technology, Ltd. 


(“IHT”), launched sales of lab services using this novel panel of biomarkers in the United 


Kingdom as part of IHT’s ProstateCheck™ program.”
62





The test has now been on the market for one full year and there has been no disclosure in Opko’s 


10-K or subsequent 10-Q’s regarding initial sales in the UK.  Given that Opko specifically 


breaks out revenue contributions from several recent acquisitions, including one that contributed 


as little as $600,000 in revenues during 2012, we think this highlights a fairly limited interest in 


this test.
63


  In fact, our discussions with physicians in the UK confirmed a low level of interest 


and we only heard mention of some use in a few London private practices.  


Also in October 2012, Opko announced that it was acquiring Prost-Data (OURLab) a CLIA lab. 


At the time, Dr Frost stated, "The addition of OURLab to the Opko family will support the early 


launch of the important 4Kscore™ prostate test as a laboratory-developed test in the U.S. and 


complements the Company's recent European commercial launch of the 4Kscore™ through its 


UK-based partner, International Health Technology, as part of its ProstateCheck™ early prostate 


cancer detection service." A year since talk of this “early launch,” we have seen no sales out of 


the U.S. and apparently no material sales in Europe.  Prost-Data’s sole shareholder was Dr. 


Jonathan Oppenheimer (OURLab stands for Oppenheimer Urologic Reference Laboratory), who 


according to the Opko press release, was to become CEO of Opko’s diagnostics division.  We 


have some concerns related to Dr. Oppenheimer’s past.  In late 2000, he lost a lawsuit in what 


the New York Times reported “…may well represent the first time in the United States that a 


jury imposed a substantial libel award against a defendant who published an anonymous Internet 


message.”  The jury’s verdict awarded Dr. Sam Graham $675,000 in compensatory and punitive 


damages after Dr. Oppenheimer posted a message on a Yahoo! Message Board under the name 


“fbiinformant” accusing Dr. Graham of taking a kickback from Urocor, a company that provides 


pathology services to hospitals (Dr. Oppenheimer used to work at Urocor).  According to a 


Forbes article published at the time, “It wasn’t true, and Oppenheimer had never even met 


Graham.  Nor did he have anything against Graham.  But Oppenheimer was trying to get 


business for his own laboratory and spreading the rumor about Graham was his way of

disparaging Urocor, a competitor.  Graham, who has since moved on to a private practice in 


Virginia, simply got in the way, according to Alan Rudlin, Graham’s lawyer.”  And according to 


an ABC news article from the time, the judge in the case “called the anonymous attack ‘about as 


despicable as any course of conduct that one could engage in.’” 


On November 7, 2012, Dr. Frost appeared on Mad Money to discuss the 4Kscore™ test.  Even 


host Jim Cramer acknowledged that “Opko is only for speculation.  It's very risky.”  During the 


interview, Dr. Frost claimed that “we can be on the market within months.”  At that point Cramer 


asked, “this is a 2013 product, right Dr. Frost,” to which he responded, “It could be very early 


2013, yes.”  Dr. Frost then stated, “by the way, it’s already on the market in the UK.  We just 


introduced it a month ago or so and now we’re going to have all of our subsidiaries in Spain and 


Latin America start to market in those locations so this is a major effort on our behalf now.”
64





We have heard nothing since then on the launches in Spain and Latin America.   It’s been a year 


and they appear to be nowhere on any of the claims from that interview. 


In December 2012, Opko acquired a Brazilian pharmaceutical company that, according to Dr. 


Frost, “…facilitates the near-term commercialization in the Brazilian market of our 4Kscore™, a 


novel panel of biomarkers and associated algorithm to more accurately detect and grade possible 


prostate cancers." One year later, we have heard nothing about any Brazilian 4Kscore™ 


revenues. 


Also, on January 28, 2013, Dr. Frost again appeared on CNBC’s Mad Money and stated, “we’re 


going to be marketing [the 4Kscore™ test] within the next two to three months in the United 


States.”
65


  It has now been ten months and there is no test being marketed in the U.S.   


In May 2013, Opko announced its Q1 operating and financial highlights.  In the press release, 


Opko claimed to be “Preparing for 4Kscore™ Commercial Launch” and stated that 


“development work toward the U.S. commercial launch of the Opko 4Kscore™ prostate cancer 


test as a laboratory developed test through our CLIA-certified laboratory based in Nashville, TN, 


remains on track for a 2013 launch.”  However, just three months later, in August 2013, the 


Opko Q2 operating and financial highlights section stated: “the U.S. commercial launch of the 


Opko 4Kscore™ prostate cancer test as a laboratory developed test will be through our CLIA-


certified laboratory based in Nashville, TN.”  Note that the language is almost identical except 


for the removal of the “remains on track for a 2013 launch” language.  


We believe reimbursement will also be a large problem with Opko’s strategy as they are trying to 


launch the test initially as a laboratory developed test (LDT).  Laboratory developed tests are 


regulated under federal laws known as the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments 


(CLIA).  They are overseen not by the FDA, but by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 


Services (CMS).  Therefore, these tests are not FDA approved and federal law doesn’t even

require that labs provide validation studies for laboratory developed tests to CMS, allowing these 


tests to get to market with a much less rigorous process.  


The government is considering stronger oversight of these tests given examples of problematic 


LDTs.  Laboratory developed tests are typically brought to market to satisfy a testing niche that 


is not served by a commercially available test.  There are currently two ways to bring an LDT to 


market: 


 The manufacturer sets up its own CLIA-certified lab.  The company then develops its test 


kits and performs all testing within that lab; or 


 The manufacturer pursues premarket approval or 510(k) notification in order to offer the 


LDT kits for sale outside of the lab in which they were developed.  Once the FDA has 


approved an LDT via this process, that test can then be assigned a CLIA classification, 


assembled into a kit and sold to labs with matching CLIA accreditation. 


So, the near-term hope for the 4Kscore™ test is that Opko will design the test out of its recently 


acquired CLIA lab in Nashville.  They will then have the small sales force that is employed by 


the lab go out and try to get urologists to use the 4Kscore™ test which will be processed at the 


Opko lab.   Developing an LDT with no real clinical data will make it very difficult to get 


insurance coverage.  They will be limited to people who will pay out of pocket which severely 


reduces the market opportunity (and likely the price that can be charged for the test). 


Here is a June 2013 investor presentation (Jefferies conference) that highlights “U.S. LDT in 


2013” for the 4Kscore™ test:

Here is a September 2013 investor presentation that claims a Q4 2013 launch as LDT (though the 


2013 language had already been removed from August 2013 press release as noted above) and 


point-of-care test “4-5 years” later: 





In summary, the 4Kscore™ test: 


 was acquired from a small, obscure group out of Finland for no upfront payment; 


 has gone over three years without anyone commercializing it; 


 has been significantly delayed; 


 has been launched in the UK but is apparently not really seeing any traction; 


 is based on questionable science (see editorial); 


 is supposed to be launched out of a small lab in the U.S. with a tiny sales force that will 


likely have a hard time canvassing a large population of urologists; and 


 patients will most likely need to pay out of pocket for the test.   


H.)  Rayaldy:  “I have probably 500 [CKD] patients in my clinic… maybe 4 or 


5 of them could benefit from switching to CTAP101” 


In January 2013, Opko announced the acquisition of a company called Cytochroma for $100 


million in stock and certain milestone payments. Cytochroma has two main products in 


development: 



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000119312513363824/d596458dex991.htm

http://investor.opko.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=732319

 CTAP101 (renamed Rayaldy): a vitamin D prohormone to treat secondary 


hyperparathyroidism in patients with Stage 3 or 4 chronic kidney disease and vitamin D 


insufficiency (Phase 3 results are expected in the first half of 2014)
66





 Alpharen (Fermagate Tablets): a non-absorbed phosphate binder to treat 


hyperphosphatemia in dialysis patients (Phase 3 results in the first half of 2017)
67





The most important drug and main focus of Opko at this point is Rayaldy.  According to 


Cytochroma’s presentation at the time of the Opko acquisition, they believed the drug could 


enter the market in 2016.   Rayaldy is targeting patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism 


(SHPT) in Stages 3 and 4 of chronic kidney disease (CKD).  In the U.S., there are an estimated 


7.6 million people with Stage 3 (moderate) chronic kidney disease (of which roughly 34% are 


believed to have SHPT).  Many patients are not even aware that they have CKD and symptoms 


are normally subtle until later in the course of the disease.  There are also roughly 400,000 Stage 


4 CKD patients (severe) and about 300,000 stage 5 patients (kidney failure). 


Many CKD patients develop secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT), which results from the 


increased production of parathyroid hormone (PTH) and develops primarily during Stages 3 


through 5.  SHPT develops in these patients when declining kidney function lowers phosphorous 


excretion, causing phosphorous levels to increase while calcium and vitamin D levels 


decline.  As the kidneys are not converting sufficient amounts of vitamin D to its active form and 


are not adequately excreting phosphate, this leads to hypocalcemia and increases in PTH 


secretion (in an attempt to increase calcium levels).  This process both weakens the bones and 


puts extra pressure on the blood vessels, with the potential for bone disease and cardiovascular 


problems in the patients. 


To treat these patients, physicians generally start with dietary changes.  After that, they will 


primarily use nutritional vitamin D and phosphorous binders.  Vitamin D helps bring down the 


parathyroid hormone (PTH), with inexpensive over-the-counter and generic prescription 


products (such as ergocalciferol or calcitriol) both widely used.  The side effect of vitamin D is 


that it can raise calcium and phosphorous too much, which can become a problem in later stages 


of CKD (when the kidneys are really struggling).  So in more advanced stages of treatment, 


physicians switch patients to other vitamin D analogs such as Zemplar and Hectorol.  These 


treatments have the beneficial effect of bringing down PTH without bringing up calcium levels. 


The following are the existing treatments on the market for treating SHPT: 


 Over-the-counter vitamin D for early treatment in Stages 3 and 4 CKD 


 Hectorol (Genzyme/Sanofi), which comes off patent in 2014

 Zemplar (Abbott), which also comes off patent in 2014 (Teva has already launched a 


generic zemplar capsule)  


 Calcitriol (a generic product) and off-label usage of another generic product called 


Drisdol (generic is ergocalciferol)  


Even if Rayaldy is approved and commercially launched in 2016, we believe there is limited 


need for new SHPT treatments.  Rayaldy will need to compete with both OTC vitamin D and 


generic vitamin D analogs when Hectorol and Zemplar come off patent next year (before Opko 


even hopes to complete its studies). 


We have spoken with numerous nephrologists who treat patients with SHPT and the tone was 


skeptical.  For example, Dr. Jeffrey Giullian, a veteran nephrologist who has about 500 CKD 


patients in his clinic, had the following to say when we discussed Rayaldy/CTAP101 and its 


market potential with him:
69





“In Stage 3 and 4 chronic kidney disease, you don’t really see the side effects of giving 


OTC vitamin D … there’s the rub ... you can give OTC or calciferol without the side 


effects.  It’s later when the kidney is struggling that the nutritional vitamin D causes the 


side effects, but at that point we’re switching over to the analogs [such as Zemplar or 


Hectorol].  So it’s hard for me to see a niche for CTAP101 … in early stages of treatment 


you can use nutritional vitamin D and in later stages you want to use Zemplar or Hectorol. 


I would think they [Cytochroma] are overstating the market opportunity…  I probably have 


500 [CKD] patients in my clinic … maybe 4 or 5 of them could benefit from switching to 


CTAP101. 


The issue is this is a new drug that is just barely better than existing treatments that are 


over-the-counter and cheap.  So would it justify a huge difference in cost, probably not.” 


When asked about the likelihood of getting nephrologists to switch patients to 


Rayaldy/CTAP101: 


“A non-inferiority trial isn’t going to get CTAP101 any traction … why would I want 


something 10x more expensive that simply isn’t inferior? Would need to demonstrate 


superiority vs. an active control.” 


And when asked whether his peers are excited about Rayaldy/CTAP101, “No, they’re not really 


talking about it.”

In total, we surveyed 51 nephrologists to gauge the market opportunity for Rayaldy.
70


  Based on 


the responses we received, the surveyed nephrologists would switch just 9% of their patients to a 


therapy like Rayaldy if it were approved.  At an annual cost of $1,500 per year, we believe the 


true sales opportunity for Rayaldy is below $150 million per year (~1 million estimated SHPT 


patients that are treated x 9% switched to Rayaldy x $1,500 annually).
71


  After selling and 


marketing expenses, we would not expect Rayaldy to ever be a major profit contributor to Opko. 


You don’t have to take our word for it as even the perpetually bullish Jefferies analyst has her 


doubts on the market potential for Rayaldy.  In her March 19, 2013 research note, she noted: 


“According to nephrologists that we talked to, it appears that there is not significant unmet 


need in treating SHPT patients currently… 


Cytochroma estimates ~$295M annual sales for oral Hectorol and Zemplar in predialysis 


settings. With Hectorol and Zemplar going generic in 2014, any new vitamin D analog with 


premium pricing would need to be far superior to capture significant market share, in our 


view…   


Our nephrologists discussions indicate a majority of patients only with vitamin D 


insufficiency would be adequately treated with OTC vitamin D supplements…  


Nephrologists note that for vitamin D insufficiency, patients with SHPT can easily take 


OTC vitamin D supplements, along with generic vitamin D analog, rather than paying a 


premium for new vitamin D analogs… 


…given that both Hectorol and Zemplar are going generic in 2014, our estimates could be 


viewed as aggressive.” 


The Jefferies analyst estimated peak sales potential for Rayaldy at ~$350 million, well short of 


the patently absurd $12 billion market size that Opko touted in a recent investor presentation.  


And we believe the $350 million estimate is based on very aggressive pricing assumptions of 


$3,500 per patient for Rayaldy, even though Hectorol and Zemplar currently cost around $3,000 


to $3,300 per year and that price will likely fall dramatically next year (before Opko even hopes 


to have completed Rayaldy trials) when both drugs go generic (as shown in the excerpts above, 


she acknowledges her estimates could be “aggressive”).  For comparison, generic treatments 


such as calcitriol and ergocalciferol generally cost a few hundred dollars per year.  Additionally, 


if approved, Rayaldy would have to compete with OTC vitamin D that can be bought at your 


local drugstore for around $5 per bottle ($50 to $60 per year).

 Calculated based on 8mm stage 3 + 4 CKD patients, of which 36% are assumed to have SHPT (34% of stage 3 


and 74% of stage 4, per zemplar website).  Estimated 1mm diagnosed prevalence for SHPT per GlobalData report 


titled “Hyperparathyroidism – Analysis and Market Forecasts to 2019” which implies 34% of stage 3+4 patients 


with SHPT are treated.

At our estimate of peak sales of no more than $150 million per year, we believe Rayaldy is worth 


at most $500 million or just $1 per Opko share.  Even at this aggressive valuation, it would still 


represent a value of five times what Opko paid to acquire Cytochroma just a few months ago. 


I.)  Prolor Biotech:  Even Their Management And Financial Advisors Are 


Skeptical 


In April 2013, Opko announced the acquisition of Prolor Biotech (“Prolor”) for $480 million in 


stock.  Prolor was a Frost-backed publicly-traded company that went public via reverse merger 


in May 2007.  The company was originally formed as LDG Inc. in August 2003 and, on May 9, 


2007, LDG Inc entered into an agreement and plan of merger/reorganization with Modigene.  


Also in May 2007, the company completed a private placement of 8.7 million shares and 


warrants (concurrent with the closing of the merger).  An additional 5.4 million shares plus 


warrants were sold to four strategic investors led by Dr. Frost for a total consideration of $2 


million (Frost and Hsiao were then appointed to the board upon closing of the transactions).  


Then, on May 21, 2007, an additional 155,673 shares of stock were issued to the Frost-led 


investor group for no additional consideration.
72


  The company’s name was changed to Prolor 


Biotech in June 2009.  Additional capital raises occurred in March 2010, with a $24.4 million 


private placement (10.4 million shares at 17% discount to average 30-day closing price) and in 


May 2012 with the issuance of 7.5 million shares at $5 per share, raising $35 million. 


The core technology for Prolor is its “CTP technology” (carboxyl terminal peptide) that can be 


attached to an array of existing therapeutic proteins to allow for a long-acting formulation (and 


therefore, once per week injections instead of daily).  Prolor has an exclusive license to the 


technology, which was developed at Washington University in St. Louis, in all but four 


endocrine proteins: FSH, LH, TSH and hCG (these are licensed to a company now owned by 


Merck).  Merck markets a drug branded Elonva (follicle-stimulating hormone, FSH, used as a 


fertility treatment) based on the technology.
73





In a May 2012 investor presentation, Prolor claimed it was going to initiate a Phase 3 study for 


hGH-CTP by December 2012.
74


 However, by a December 2012 investor presentation, they 


indicated that they were on track for a Q1 2013 filing for adult Phase 3 trial program and that this 


was “only 3 months delay compared to original plan.”
75


  Per Opko’s Q2 2013 10-Q, “in June 


2013, Prolor initiated a pivotal Phase III clinical trial for its long-acting version of human growth 


hormone, hGH-CTP, for treatment in adults with growth hormone deficiency (GHD).”
76


  So they 


finally got the trial launched, but seven months behind the mid-2012 expectations.

The Phase 3 trial for adults consists of 189 patients in U.S., EU and Israel.  Phase 3 results are 


expected in H2 2015 (per Opko’s September 2013 investor presentation).
77


  For pediatric use, a 


Phase 2 trial is ongoing with Phase 3 results expected in H1 2018.
78





Unfortunately for Opko, Prolor has been beaten to the punch by LG Life Sciences, who will 


likely have a nearly identical drug on the market next year, before Prolor will even complete its 


trials.  LG Life Sciences has been producing growth hormone Declage since 2007.  Per LG’s Q2 


2013 investor presentation, you can see that they have completed Phase 3 trials in their SR-hGH 


(slow-release human growth hormone) and have filed an NDA: 





Additionally, LG and partner BioPartners received EU approval for the drug in August 2013 and 


announced they were “…the first company to receive a marketing authorisation in the EU, 


Norway and Iceland for a prolonged-release formulation of recombinant human growth hormone 


(rhGH) which will cut the number of self-administered injections from once-a-day to once-a-


week - a major breakthrough in rhGH treatment.” 


While further behind, even Teva Pharmaceuticals appears to be focused on the long-acting 


market, having moved into Phase 2 for a long-acting human growth hormone (Teva also 


produces Tev-Tropin, a short-acting HGH drug currently on the market).

A read of the Prolor/Opko merger proxy reveals how little interest the Prolor assets seemed to 


generate in the marketplace.  In the “Background of the Merger” section, Prolor disclosed that it 


was “engaged in extensive discussions and negotiations with a pharmaceutical company, which 


we refer to as ‘Bidder A,’ regarding a potential acquisition of Prolor by Bidder A.
80


  Dr. Frost is 


a director of and deemed an affiliate of Bidder A.”  These discussions took place between 


October and December 2012 and given that they disclosed Frost was a board member of “Bidder 


A,” it is almost assuredly Teva.
81





According to the proxy, Teva appears to have walked away after diligence:   


“Following extensive due diligence by Bidder A, including site visits at the facilities of 


Prolor and its suppliers, Bidder A determined not to proceed with an acquisition of Prolor 


and suggested to Prolor that the parties focus their future discussions on the licensing by 


Prolor to Bidder A of specific applications of Prolor’s technology. Over the following 


months, Bidder A’s and Prolor’s respective management teams engaged in continued 


discussions regarding potential licensing arrangements; however, Prolor and Bidder A did 


not reach a definitive agreement regarding any such arrangement.”
82





So at that point, it appears the focus turned to a merger of Opko and Prolor, with no other bidders 


expressing any serious interest in Prolor. 


Also interesting is what the proxy says about management’s own views of its prospects and the 


sales of its hGH-CTP drug.  Using Prolor management’s projections, Oppenheimer (the financial 


advisor to the special committee of Prolor’s board) performed a net present value analysis of 


Prolor’s various assets.  Here are the results of their analysis (see pages 68-69 of the proxy): 





So, even the much touted Phase 3 opportunity is viewed by Prolor’s own management and its 


financial advisors as being worth only $131 million to $174 million, or just 2.6% to 3.4% of 


Opko’s current fully-diluted market capitalization.
83

J.)  A Web Of Stock Promotion That Should Concern Even The Most Brazen 


Investor 


While Dr. Frost is a billionaire who has earned the admiration of the investment community after 


selling two companies (Key Pharmaceuticals and Ivax Corporation) for incredibly large gains, 


we also think there is another side of his career that should be of great concern to anyone 


investing in Opko.  Dr. Frost has a disturbingly large number of connections to what we believe 


are two serial stock promoters that have each been the subject of multiple lawsuits, Barry Honig 


and Michael Brauser (who together run an entity called Marlin Capital).   


We have counted 16 different penny stocks in which Frost, Honig and Brauser have all invested 


in recent years, including entities in which Opko is directly involved.  In fact, the business 


address listed for Honig and Brauser, 4400 Biscayne Blvd., is owned by Dr. Frost and is also the 


offices of Opko Health, Ladenburg Thalmann (again, where Dr. Frost is Chairman) and 


numerous other companies in which Frost, Honig and/or Brauser are involved (including 


MusclePharm, BioZone, SafeStitch Medical, Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems and others).  In 


fact, Barry Honig’s office is listed as being in the exact same suite (Suite 850) of 4400 Biscayne 


Blvd. as Dr. Frost’s Frost Gamma Investments Trust.
84





We have found 38 different stocks connected to Barry Honig and 15 connected to Michael 


Brauser (there are likely many more, but this is what we could track down).  Only three of these 


companies have a market capitalization above $150 million, only one of these companies 


generates a profit… (Pyramid Oil), which only makes around $1 million per year.
85


  Many of 


these companies have cost investors a significant amount of money and both individuals have 


been the subject of extensive litigation.

First, a company called Sunair Services Corporation (SNR) filed suit against Honig and Brauser 


(and others) in March 2009 for violations of federal securities laws.  Here are some of the 


specifics from the lawsuit regarding Mr. Brauser’s background that Sunair believed should have 


been disclosed: 


“…Specifically, Equifax alleged that Defendant Michael Brauser participated in the 


fraudulent creation of fictitious receivables and further participated in accounting 


overstatements that disguised Naviant’s true financial condition.
86





…Equifax alleges in the Federal Fraud Litigation that, in order to induce Equifax to enter 


into a merger with Naviant, Defendant Michael Brauser (a) hid low-priced “CPM” (Cost 


Per Thousand) e-mail transactions in order to inflate Naviant’s effective CPM rate, (b) 


maintained one set of books for Naviant that was more accurate and complete and another 


that omitted the low-priced e-mail transactions, which Naviant provided to Equifax and its 


accountants during merger negotiations, (c) misrepresented the volume and price of 


transactions that accounted for a large percentage of Naviant’s pre-acquisition revenue, 


and (d) engaged in fictitious transactions with other email marketing companies to inflate 


Naviant’s financial performance.

…Softbank Capital Partners (“Softbank”), a Naviant shareholder, sued Defendant Michael 


Brauser on March 24, 2008, in the Federal Fraud Litigation for breach of contract and 


indemnification for Defendant Michael Brauser’s failure to pay Softbank his share of the 


millions of dollars of attorney’s fees and costs incurred by Softbank in its capacity as the 


shareholders representative of Naviant. Softbank claims that “a substantial portion of 


Equifax’s claims were meritorious” and Defendant Michael Brauser had been “intimately 


involved in carrying out various frauds at Naviant and covering up their misdeeds through 


threats and intimidation.” Softbank also claims that Defendant Michael Brauser 


represented to Softbank that he was “judgment proof” as a result of transferring away all 


of his personal assets, with the exception of his Bentley automobile and personal 


computer…
88





… Defendant Michael Brauser also was sued on January 30, 2009, for fraud and breach of 


fiduciary duty in Kast v. The Tube Media Corp., 09-06285, in the Circuit Court for the 17th 


Judicial Circuit in and for Broward County, Florida (“State Fraud Litigation”), in 


connection with Defendant Michael Brauser’s role as a Director of The Tube Media Corp., 


a publicly traded company that ceased operation in October 2007. Specifically, Defendant 


Michael Brauser is accused of knowingly withholding payroll taxes from employees 


without remitting them to the government, filing materially false and misleading financial 


reports, and intentionally making misrepresentations of material facts.”

Barry Honig was also sued in January 2011 in relation to Empire Sports & Entertainment 


(EXCX) by former two-time winning heavyweight champion Shannon Briggs.  According to one 


article, “…Briggs filed a major lawsuit in New York State Supreme Court, alleging breach of 


fiduciary duty, conversion, unjust enrichment and breach of contract against Gregory D. Cohen, 


Shelly Finkel and Barry Honig, and their boxing and entertainment promotional company, 


Empire Sports & Entertainment.”  Briggs claimed he was the “victim of a ‘ripoff’ on two fronts 


by his former promoters and business partners, part and parcel of which includes documents in 


which his signature was ‘forged.’”  Financially, Briggs alleged that he had agreed to fight then 


world champion Vitali Klitschko for a purse of $750,000, “…but that he wound up with a mere 


$25,000, after he returned to the United States after the prolonged hospital stay in Hamburg. … 


‘To add insult to injury,’ the lawsuit alleges, ‘the defendants deducted the cost of Briggs' 


hospitalization from the understated purse of the bout.’” 


However, the story doesn’t end there.  Empire Sports & Entertainment ultimately became 


Sagebrush Gold (SAGE) on June 1, 2011, with Barry Honig serving as Chairman.  In October 


2011, Honig announced to Sagebrush shareholders that “Legendary investor Dr. Phillip Frost 


(Chairman of Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Opko Health, Inc.) has 


invested $5 million in our subordinated debt and convertible preferred stock.”  The company 


changed names once again and became Pershing Gold (PGLC) in March 2012.  Today, Pershing 


Gold is 19.4% owned by Frost and 10.1% owned by Honig.  Brauser had also previously been a 


shareholder but appears to have sold all of his shares in April 2013.
90





If this isn’t enough, Adrian James (a well-known stock promoter involved in such companies as 


KWBT, SRGE, DHNA, POWN, PYTL, ZOWI and LYJN, to name a few) shows up as a 


shareholder of Pershing Gold and was hired by a company called Valor Gold (VGLD) in which 


Pershing Gold owned a stake.  James’ involvement with Frost/Honig/Brauser entities appears to 


extend to Sagebrush Gold (before it became Pershing) and MusclePharm.  As an interesting side 


note, Adrian James sued Jonathan Lebed, another well-known stock promoter associated with an 


entity he calls the National Inflation Association (NIA), for ripping off his “Stockumentary” and 


illegally using footage from his company’s stock promotion videos.  In addition to being behind 


the spectacular rise and crash of Synacor (SYNC) in 2012, Lebed’s NIA had earlier heavily 


promoted a company called BroadVision (BVSN), an obscure company that briefly soared in 


early 2012 after the NIA began recommending the stock to its membership.  Interestingly, in 


October 2011, before the NIA promotion began, Honig and Brauser’s Marlin Capital filed a 13D 


indicating a 5.5% ownership interest in the company.  In its disclosure, the NIA stated that its co-


founders “…have also been referred business in the past from somebody who has filed as a large 


BroadVision shareholder.”    


Brauser and Honig were both involved in a company called SendTec (SNDN) which lasted 


traded for $0.0007 per share (that’s not a typo).  Brauser resigned as Chairman in September

2006 and in November 2006, a class action suit was filed against the company and individuals 


including both Michael Brauser and Barry Honig.     


Opko itself is involved with the penny stock trio through its ownership of 10.9% of BioZone 


Pharmaceuticals (BZNE).  Currently, Frost owns 14.5% of the company, Honig owns 7.9% and 


Brauser owns 6.8%.  Here are some facts about BioZone: 


 The value of this investment to Opko is minimal, as BioZone’s total market cap is just 


$40 million and the company generated just $2 million of revenues last quarter (which 


was down 56% from the prior year); 


 Since Opko announced its investment in BioZone in February 2012, the stock is down 


~80%;
91


 and 


 The Frost Group, Honig, and Brauser were all the subject to a lawsuit by the original 


founder of the company 


The lawsuit by the original founder draws a clear link among Frost, Honig and Brauser, referring 


to them as the “Brauser Honig Frost Group,” with the following specific complaints from an 


article on the litigation: 


“When BioZone Laboratories founder Daniel Fisher sold shares in his company to 


investors with Brauser Honig Frost Group, the parties entered a stock-sale agreement and 


an employment agreement that would provide Fisher with a job at the new BioZone 


Pharmaceuticals, according to court documents… 


…His lawsuit also accuses Brauser Honig Frost Group and its investors, many of whom 


became executives at BioZone Pharmaceuticals after the sale, of violating the Racketeer 


Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act for engaging in a pattern of similar behavior 


against other companies. 


We describe [several] other suits against these defendants, either one or a group of them, 


in which a similar set of behaviors occurred,’ Darcy Paul [his lawyer] said. ‘This looks 


like a scheme.’” 


Also, an investor would be forgiven for wondering why, in August 2013,
92


 BioZone sold 


convertible notes and warrants to MusclePharm, a company backed by Honig (including his 


company, GRQ Consultants) that lists Frost as a member of its “Scientific Advisory Board” 


(with MusclePharm leasing office space in Frost’s building).
93,94


  And then just last month it was 


announced that BioZone is going to sell “substantially all of [its] operating assets” to 


                                                           
91


 Based on 12/6/13 closing price of $0.64, stock has fallen 83% since its closing price of $3.69 (on 2/27/12)

MusclePharm.  BioZone subsequently announced that it will merge with Cocrystal Discovery (a 


private company in which Opko and Frost are investors). 


Opko is also involved with yet another investment with “the trio,” ChromaDex (CDXC).  Opko 


made a $1 million investment in CDXC in February 2012 for a 1.5% ownership stake of the 


company.
95


  Once again, Opko is a shareholder alongside Frost (14.6% of the company), Honig 


(7.6% of the company) and Brauser (7.9% of the company).  This time, Honig and Brauser are 


co-Chairmen of the company.  


Here are some other connections that Frost has with Honig and/or Brauser that just further 


highlight the complicated web of relationships: 


1. Castle Brands (ROX) 


2. uSell.com (USEL) 


3. Fuse Science (DROP) 


4. Passport Potash (PPI CN) 


5. SafeStitch Medical (SFES) 


6. Document Security Systems (DSS) 


7. Data Acquisitions Group LLC (Private) 


8. Bullfrog Gold (BFGC) 


9. Silver Horn Mining (SILV) 


Dr. Frost has also been involved in plenty of other penny stocks that do not (at least as far as we 


can tell) appear to have any Honig or Brauser involvement.  Perhaps the most remarkable 


situation is that of Protalix BioTherapeutics (PLX).  This company was merged with Orthodontix 


(traded on the pink sheets under OTIX) in August 2006.  Simultaneously, Frost and Glenn 


Halpryn (who together owned a majority of Orthodontix) agreed to invest $15 million in 


Protalix.  At that time, Frost and his trusted lieutenant, Dr. Jane Hsiao (who is the current Vice 


Chairman and Chief Technical Officer of Opko) joined the Protalix board.  Interestingly, Eli 


Hurvitz was the Chairman of Protalix at the time and was also the Chairman of Teva at that 


point.  Amazingly, on October 24, 2007, Protalix announced a 10 million share offering at $5 per 


share vs. the prior close of $36.06 per share, an astounding 86% discount.  The next day, the 


stock fell 83%, “wiping away $2.07 billion in market value”.  Dr. Frost and Hsiao, who had 


joined the board on 12/31/06, quit the Protalix board after the company’s implosion, with the 


press release citing “personal reasons.”

Frost has also been involved with the following penny stocks: 


1. Anfield Resources (ARY CN) 


2. Non-Invasive Monitoring Systems (NIMU) 


3. Tiger X Medical (CDOM) 


4. Winston Pharmaceuticals (WPHM) 


5. Alliqua (ALQAD) 


6. Cadiz (CDZI) 


7. Wright Investors’ Service Holdings (WISH) 


If all this is not concerning enough, consider the following facts related to Opko’s former Chief 


Financial Officer.  On July 16, 2012, long-time Frost colleague Rao Uppaluri retired from his 


role as CFO of Opko and was replaced by Juan Rodriguez.  We find it strange that Uppaluri was 


listed as Treasurer and Director of Ideation Acquisition Corp, a publicly traded company, as 


recently as a 10-K filed on March 20, 2009 when at that same time, he was the CFO of Opko.
96





But, Uppaluri’s bio in the Opko 10-K filed around the same time only discloses that he was on 


the board of Ideation (not that he was Treasurer).
97


  Also of note, at that time, Dr. Frost served as 


the Chairman of the Board for Ideation.  Ideation ultimately merged with a company in China, 


changing its name to SearchMedia Holdings.  SearchMedia was ultimately discovered to be a 


fraud, with its auditor KPMG resigning from the account and a lawsuit describing the fraud.  


The complaint sums up the situation:   


“Then on August 20, 2010, SearchMedia Holdings Limited announced that the historical 


financial statements of SearchMedia International Limited for the 2007 and 2008 fiscal 


years would have to be restated and that the financial statements from these periods should 


no longer be relied upon. SearchMedia Holdings Limited also indicated that it estimated 


that revenue in 2007 and 2008 had been overstated by approximately $6 million and $25 


million, respectively. …[the] stock fell nearly 23%, to close on August 20, 2010, at $2.62 


per share. Over the next few days, SearchMedia's stock continued to decline and closed at 


$1.70 per share on August 23, 2010, a 50% decline from the closing price of $3.40 per 


share on August 19, 2010.” 


The company has since changed its name to Tiger Media (IDI) and trades for $1.30 per share 


with Frost still owning 28% of the company.  Despite the fact that the company was a disastrous 


investment for Dr. Frost, that the books turned out to be fake and that the new Tiger Media (still

trading under the ticker IDI), recorded no revenues for any of the past three years, Dr. Frost 


inexplicably continues to buy shares of this seemingly worthless entity with a ~$40 million 


market capitalization, most recently buying around $250,000 in stock on July 10, 2013.

The Tangled Web 








K.)  We Believe Insider Share Purchases At Opko Are A Red Herring    


Dr. Frost has consistently purchased Opko shares in the open market and many investors seem to 


be buying the stock at any price based on this fact alone.  The logic seems to go, “if Phil is 


buying, surely he must know something.”  Investors have been trained to follow insider buying, 


and we believe Dr. Frost has likely taken advantage of that fact to draw in many unsuspecting

retail buyers that don’t fully understand what they own.   We imagine Dr. Frost at this point 


realizes he is effectively “pot committed” in Opko and if he stops buying shares in the open 


market, confidence would likely disappear and the stock could plummet (his stake is also worth 


an astonishing $1.9 billion, which is a lot to fight hard to hold on to… not to mention what must 


be his keen interest in maintaining the support and trust of his followers).
99





Consider this:  Dr. Frost has engaged in insider purchases at Opko for years going back to 2007, 


and it is rather obvious now to us in hindsight that he didn’t “know something” after all, since 


everything the Company has been working on throughout that period has been a failure or 


disappointment (the Company’s main assets today were largely acquired just in the past year).     


If Dr. Frost is buying the shares out of a genuine belief the shares are undervalued then why buy 


a little bit every day as opposed to all at once?  Also, why would he go to such lengths to bolster 


the price through numerous television appearances and overly optimistic statements if he is 


trying to buy the stock for financial gain?  To highlight what an unhealthy focus Opko has on its 


stock price, the Company issued a bizarre press release in February 2013 just minutes after the 


Company’s stock fell a few percent following the disclosure of a stock sale by the Chief 


Accounting Officer.  The press release stated the sale was “done to address pressing family 


circumstances” and “no other sales by Company officers are currently contemplated.”   


Perhaps even more importantly, shareholders might want to consider that for every share that Dr. 


Frost has purchased, the Company has issued nearly six more to finance acquisitions and raise 


capital over the years (fully-diluted shares have increased from 201 million in 2007 to 470 


million today) – not the behavior we would expect from a company that believes its shares are a 


good value. 


Finally, some Opko bulls have even put forth what we believe is the outlandish notion that Teva 


Pharmaceuticals might buy Opko given the connection to Dr. Frost.  Consider that Teva’s market 


capitalization is $35 billion with $5.5 billion of operating profit vs. Opko’s market capitalization 


of $5 billion with run-rate losses of $100 million… how can a public company Board of 


Directors ever consider such a transaction?  We would like to point out that based on the 


Opko/Prolor merger proxy, it appears Teva conducted due diligence and passed on a deal to buy 


Prolor (and that would be one-tenth the size of Opko).  And lastly, consider everything included 


in this report and imagine a public company board ever considering spending $5 billion or more 


on this company.

L.)  Analyst Coverage is Biased and Perennially Incorrect 


The only significant sell-side research firms that cover Opko’s stock include Ladenburg 


Thalmann, which is Dr. Frost’s company, and Jefferies, which is the Company’s underwriter and 


M&A advisor.  Not surprisingly, both firms have consistently been way too bullish on Opko’s 


prospects. 


In Ladenburg’s July 14, 2011 initiation report, the analyst claimed:
100





“The market for an effective blood-based Alzheimer’s screening test could approach $3B 


annually…   


Our model calls for OPK to become cash flow positive by 2014 based on introduction of 


the Alzheimer’s diagnostic test (launch in 2013) and potential contribution from the 


vaccine franchise.  If OPK is successful in launching its Alzheimer’s test, in our view, the 


company may not need additional capital to finance development of its current pipeline.”   


It is now fairly obvious that Opko will almost assuredly be significantly cash flow negative in 


2014, the Alzheimer’s test did not launch in 2013 and appears to be a failure and the Company 


has already raised capital through a $175 million convertible debt issuance (not to mention the 


considerable stock issuance for acquisitions). 


A March 7, 2013 Ladenburg note highlighted that Opko’s asset sale agreement with RXi 


Pharmaceuticals (RXII) for certain intellectual property for RXi stock valued at $7 million (plus 


milestones and royalties) “unlocks significant long term value.”
101


  It is unclear to us how such 


an immaterial transaction to a $5 billion company is even worthy of mention, much less an 


argument that it “unlocks value.”  In any case, these programs are unlikely to be worth anything 


in the hands of RXi (with a market capitalization below $40 million), as even Ladenburg admits 


that this IP relates to programs that “previously failed to meet a futility analysis in Phase III.” 


Then on March 19, 2013 (just twelve days after the prior note), Ladenburg released yet another 


note in which they explained that “OPK reiterated plans to launch the Claros point-of-care PSA 


test during 2H13 in Europe and to submit a 510(k) to FDA in 2014.
102


  While the 10-K does not 


comment on timing of [a] U.S. launch for 4KScore™, we continue to expect the test to be 


introduced in [the] U.S. during 2013.”  Again, Opko failed to deliver on each of the 2013 goals 


but was again not held accountable by the analyst community.

After helping complete a March 2011 equity offering as the lead bookrunner, Jefferies initiated 


coverage of Opko on November 10, 2011 with a Buy rating and an $8 price target.
103


  In the 


report, the analyst stated that “With the recent Claros acquisition, OPK is to launch Claros’ 


point-of-care PSA system in Europe in 1Q12; with potential 510(k) approval in the U.S. by 


YE12, we forecast ~$500M in peak U.S./EU sales.”  As we have discussed, neither of these 


dates were met and Claros has not generated a single dollar of revenue.  In her sum of the parts, 


the Jefferies analyst even assigns a value of “~$3/sh for Claros’ PSA system.”  To highlight the 


absurd nature of this valuation, at that time, Opko had roughly 330 million diluted shares 


outstanding, so she was valuing Claros at almost $1 billion even though it had been acquired just 


the previous month in a competitive auction for $30 million.
104





The same report stated that the test for “for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and cancers (yet-to-be 


proven technology) could provide significant long-term upside potential (>~$800M in sales).”  


Again, this program has been an apparent failure and has generated zero revenues for Opko. 


In an April 19, 2012 report, Jefferies acknowledged that there had been “delays in some of the 


programs” and went on to highlight “…(1) results from diagnostic validation study for 


Alzheimer’s disease now expected in ~2H12 (vs. 1Q12 previously), (2) EU launch of Claros’ 


point-of-care PSA system now expected in 2H12 (vs. 1Q12 previously) and (3) data from 6-


month study for Claros’ point-of-care PSA system … in ~2013 (vs. 2H12 previously).”
105


  Yet 


amazingly none of these disappointments or delays resulted in any change to the price target 


despite a 32% reduction in estimated 2014 revenues vs. her initiation report.
106


  And in any 


event, Opko subsequently missed each one of these new, later deadlines. 


In a May 13, 2013 report, the Jefferies analyst excitedly discussed the “4Kscore
TM


 U.S. launch in 


~mid-2013 in [a] non-Medicare patient population by Prost-Data (CLIA-certified lab) using ~30 


sales reps.”
107


  Yet three months later, with no change to her price target, the expected timing 


was quietly dropped in an August 12, 2013 report, where she described the timing as 


“…4Kscore™ U.S. launch in [a] non-Medicare patient population by Prost-Data (CLIA-certified 


lab) using ~30 sales reps (timing undisclosed)…”
108





In the most recent report dated November 12, 2013, Jefferies conceded that “With delays in Dx 


development/launches (e.g., 4Kscore™, Claros-1 system for prostate cancer), OPK's focus is 


now on pharmaceuticals…”
109


  Yet oddly, these developments warranted a price target increase 


to $11.50 per share.

M.) We Believe Opko Shares Are Worth 75% to 100% Less Than The 


Current Price 


Based on our research as detailed in this report, it is our belief that Opko will never generate a 


profit, which would render an ultimate share price of $0 per share.  Even under an incredibly 


optimistic scenario whereby the 4Kscore™, Cytochroma and Prolor Biotech were each worth 


$500 million and all other assets generated enough money to cover operating losses (thereby 


netting to a value of zero), the stock would only be worth $3 per share, or nearly 75% below the 


current price. 








We believe we may be reaching the point at which Opko’s shares begin trading in-line with a 


reasonable estimate of fair value.  We believe the combination of Dr. Frost’s buying, intense 


retail buying and unrealistically bullish analyst research was able to have an outsized impact on 


Opko’s stock price historically when its free float was small, but now with the current free float 


having more than tripled in value over the past year, we believe it is much more likely that 


Opko’s shares will reflect reality in the future. 


We estimate the free float of Opko has expanded from $650 million one year ago to $2.5 billion 


today due to (1) the all-stock acquisitions of Cytochroma, Prost-Data and Prolor Biotech, (2) the 


partial early conversion of the convertible debt into equity and (3) the sharp rise in the share 


price.

Multiplied by:  Opko Share Price (12/9/13) x $11.10 per share 


9/30/13 Opko Free Float ($) $2.5 billion  


Furthermore, the stock has been added to the TASE 25 index (Tel Aviv) and saw its weighting in 


the Russell 2000 increase at the end of August, which in turn have increased the shares that are 


available for borrow (as index funds generally lend out their shares).   As a result, Opko shares 


can now be borrowed by short sellers at a current annual rate of <10% whereas they were nearly 


impossible to borrow over the course of the past year.    


N.)  Conclusion 


We believe Opko shares offer little in the way of substance and a great deal in the way of 


illusion.  We believe Opko shareholders have unknowingly been fed a placebo, a mere sugar pill 


of insider share purchases, overhyped opportunities and bullish analyst forecasts.  The problem, 


of course, with a placebo is generally one of confidence.  As long as people believe in the 


efficacy of a placebo, it has remarkable powers, but once people realize this supposed wonder 


drug is just a simple sugar pill, its powers can suddenly disappear.
