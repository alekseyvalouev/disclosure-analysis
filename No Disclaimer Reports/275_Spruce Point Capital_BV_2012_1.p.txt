Bazaarvoice's Valuation Is Utterly Bizarre 
June 14, 2012 





Situation Overview 
 


On February 23rd, Bazaarvoice (Nasdaq: BV) raised $114 million at its initial public offering by selling 9.5 
million shares at $12 per share. The expected pricing range was $8.00 - $10.00 per share, and the shares 
ultimately closed at $16.50 on the first day of trading. At today's price of $17.00, the company's fully 
diluted enterprise value is approximately $1.1 billion. 


So what does this billion dollar company do? Bazaarvoice is a provider of social commerce solutions that 
help clients capture, display and analyze online word-of-mouth, including consumer-generated ratings and 
reviews, questions and answers, stories, recommendations, photographs, videos and other content about 
their clients' brands, products or services. The company's solutions are provided via a SaaS platform to 
clients in a range of industries including retail, consumer products, travel and leisure, technology, financial 
services, healthcare and automotive industries. 


Call me anti-social or just an extreme skeptic, but I struggle to justify BV's $1.1 billion enterprise value. 
Since being founded in May 2005, the company has been unable to reach an EBITDA or cash flow positive 
break-point, and is not projected to do so any time soon. When you strip-out the Wall Street buzz words du 
jour of "social" and "SaaS" from BV's business description, you're left with what appears to be a pedestrian 
marketing analytics company that may forever be challenged to achieve commercial success. Even the most 
bullish Wall Street estimates have BV bleeding cash until 2014, which would mark a total of 9 years of 
consecutive losses. 


Of course, there's no guarantee that the company will ever achieve a profit, or a proven business model. A 
major sticking point for potential customers appears to be their unwillingness to embrace BV's solution 
such as Ratings & Reviews, due to the discomfort with displaying negative reviews about products or 
services offered on their websites. Furthermore, policing fraudulent or inaccurate reviews presents a major 
challenge. 


In the table below I've illustrated BV's historical and projected financial model. The company will be 
investing heavily in sales, marketing, research and development expenses in the next few years. This will 
keep adjusted EBITDA and free cash flow strongly negative. The analysts are expecting this investment to 
continue driving revenue growth, but at a sharply lower growth rate from recent history. The revenue 
growth rate is expected to decline to 24.0% in calendar year 2013, from 67.7% in 2011.
There may be a glimmer of hope for BV's financial future if you believe the company's cohort analysis 
provided in the prospectus. Since the company makes significant upfront investments in acquiring new 
clients, it does take time to achieve a return on the investment, especially since revenue is recognized 
ratably over the contract life when the customer starts using the solution. The 2008 client cohort analysis is 
illustrated in the table below. The historical evidence is limited to just one cohort so far, so there is not 
enough current evidence to say for sure if their model will succeed.

For the current time, investors are left to marvel at the wildly bullish sell-side analyst commentary, and 
valuation techniques reminiscent of the internet heyday to justify their price targets. Take Credit Suisse for 
example, which proclaimed in their April 6th initiation report that "BV is a market leader in a duopoly, with 
a network larger than Amazon's (AMZN)." Most of the sell-side research indicates that BV has just one 
competitor called PowerReviews, and that BV has twice the market share. I suppose it depends on how you 
define which "market" BV is servicing since the market for web analytics and market research is pretty 
broad and intensely competitive. 


If it truly is a duopoly, then it must exist because there are no profits in this market to attract other 
competition, or barriers to entry are incredibly high in this industry. If BV and PowerReviews are not the 
next Pepsi (PEP) / Coke (KO), Airbus / Boeing (BA) or FedEx (FDX) / UPS combo, then it appears Wall Street 
analysts are being overly generous in proclaiming them to be a market leader in a duopoly. Even BV admits 
in its prospectus that its competition is broad, intensely competitive, and subject to a changing landscape. 


Our main competition is from traditional marketing and advertising programs used by businesses that 
remain hesitant to embrace social commerce solutions such as Ratings & Reviews. Additionally, some 
businesses have developed, or may develop in the future, social commerce solutions internally. These 
businesses may consider their internal solutions adequate, even if our solutions are superior. We have 
several direct and indirect competitors that provide third-party social commerce solutions, including 
companies like PowerReviews, Inc. and Revieworld Ltd. Additionally, we face potential competition from 
participants in adjacent markets that may enter our markets by leveraging related technologies and 
partnering with other companies. We may also face competition from companies entering our market, 
including large Internet companies like Google (GOOG) and Facebook (FB), which could expand their 
platforms or acquire a competitor. While these companies do not currently focus on our market, they have 
significantly greater financial resources and, in the case of Google, a longer operating history. 


Given the competitive dynamics and struggle to make a profit in the industry, it came as no surprise to me 
that on May 24th, BV announced and closed the acquisition of PowerReviews. I'm still waiting for the 
analyst community to proclaim that BV no longer operates in a duoply, but now a dominant monopoly. The 
acquisition appears highly defensive, and at a steep price to BV shareholders at approximately $168 million, 
including $31 million in cash and 8.0 million shares (includes assumption/conversion of 1.6m options). 
PowerReviews had 2011 revenues of just $11.5 million, and earnings losses, so the deal values the company 
at 14.6x revenues. 


The articulated strategic rationale is that the combined companies will deliver "higher ROI for clients 
through an enhancement of the technology platform and the merging of two great teams." The key metric 
that management guided investors towards was the combination of a larger client platform, with BV 
contributing 737 clients, and PowerReviews contributing 1,800. Investors' initial reaction was to bid up BV's 
stock price modestly on the announcement. However, investors might want to consider carefully that 
management offered no tangible roadmap or guidance as to how the deal would provide revenue and 
earnings growth synergies, or cost savings. The ultimate success or failure of the deal will depend on 
bottom-line financial results, which are still unproven and subject to above average risk.
Meanwhile, on the deal announcement call, management reiterated that in "the overall competitive 
landscape, there are dozens and dozens of companies competing for share of wallet around social, and 
reach and scale is incredibly important." At least this is one point I agree with the company. 


The landscape of existing and potential competitors for social commerce solutions is deep and wide. In a 
quick internet search I found no less than 27 companies that are capable of assisting clients with aspects of 
their social commerce strategies. I have characterized the competition as direct, adjacent, and potential. 
Direct competitors offer essentially the same products and services as BV. 


Adjacent competitors such as Google and Salesforce.com (CRM) could easily expand their platforms or 
acquire competitors to offer most of BV's products and solutions. Potential competitors include companies 
with a core focus on marketing services and analytics, that offer social solutions, and could move into the 
social reviews space. Examples of such companies include Coremetrics, a business owned by IBM. 


Competition in the social media marketing and solutions market appears to be intensifying at a rapid pace. 
Just recently, Salesforce.com acquired Buddy Media for $689 million, while Oracle acquired Virtue for $300 
million and Collective Intellect. While Buddy Media is perceived to be an adjacent competitor to BV, having 
CRM's muscle behind it may be a catalyst for increasing movement into BV's space. Oracle's move to buy 
Collective Intellect is a direct competitive threat; the company collects, processes and synthesizes online 
consumer conversations.

BV valuation is pre deal announcement
After 12 hours of meticulously reviewing BV's product offering vis-à-vis a wide landscape of actual and 
potential competitors, my head was spinning in social confusion from trying to figure out how BV could 
differentiate itself and maintain its market position among all of these potential competitors. 


Recall that BV's main value proposition to its customers are: 1) capturing and displaying word-of-mouth 
content 2) analyzing this data and; 3) distributing and syndicating the content. In other words, when you 
boil it down to basics, they collect, analyze and display data. This appears to be exactly what every company 
I've identified in the table above is capable of doing. 


What I also find striking is that only 1 out of 4 sell-side reports I reviewed even bothered to mention any 
potential threat from the likes of Google. Therefore, it came as no surprise to me that not a single analyst 
commented when on April 30th and June 5th, Google Analytics released new features that appear to 
directly compete with BV's attempt to grow its own analytics business. The new set of social reports 
produced by Google Analytics help measure the impact of social marketing initiatives and evaluate the

So what is BV really worth? 
 


So how do you value a company with a long history and future of losses, an expensive new acquisition with 
integration risks, and an admittedly uncertain business model with rapidly escalating competition? Any 
traditional discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis would surely depend on very subjective assumptions. 
Morgan Stanley and Piper Jaffray do not even attempt the futile exercise of a DCF. On the other hand, 
Credit Suisse does perform a DCF and arrives at a $20 price target, but wisely initiates BV at a Neutral 
rating, and warns that the stock is richly valued. Deutsche Bank stands alone with its most aggressive $27 
price target, arrived at with a combination of a DCF analysis and multiple of sales target. 


In fact, in the absence of any positive EBITDA or EPS targets in the near-term for BV, the only price 
justification the analysts use is a multiple of sales. The obvious handicap here is that the analysts reference 
other EPS negative businesses in rapidly evolving markets such as Jive Software (JIVE) and NetSuite (N). A 
summary of the current analyst price targets and justifications are provided in the table below. 











On the one hand, the company tells investors exactly what the shares are worth. On page 72 of the 
company's prospectus, they detail that the last valuation analysis on January 17, 2012 conducted by the 
board prior to going public was $9.60 per share. This is consistent with the initial IPO range. Why investors 
have bid up the shares by 75% in the absence of any material financial improvement represents pure 
speculation and investor euphoria. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that the company's CEO and CFO 
have already made preparations to sell stock under Rule 10b5-1 while the stock is at elevated levels. 





Broker Target Commentary


Piper Jaffray
Buy 
/ $21  


We note a healthy current valuation on BV shares due to frothy comparable valuations for the 
Cloud/Social peer group; Our $21 price target is derived by applying an 8.8x EV/revenue 
multiple to our CY2013 revenue forecast of $158.4 million. We view EV/revenue analysis as 
more meaningful for early-stage companies that have not yet reached a mature margin or 
cash flow profile


Morgan Stanley
Overweight 
/ $24


Our $24 target represents 0.32x EV/Sales/Growth, in line with high growth peers. We believe 
a growth-adjusted EV/Sales multiple is the most appropriate metric for valuing BV. BV 
currently trades at 7.3x EV/CY13 Sales or 0.25x on a growth-adjusted basis, a slight premium to 
the peer group average of 0.24x but a discount to other high-growth names like JIVE (0.33x) 
and N (0.44x)


Credit Suisse
Neutral 
/ $20


While there is much to like about the BV story, its shares have appreciated ~61% since its IPO, 
there is limited upside potential to our $20 target price and we would prefer to wait for a 
better entry point.


Deutsche Bank
Buy 
/ $26  


Our $26 PT is based on 10x 2013 EV/Revenue, and is supported by a DCF analysis with 14% 
WACC and 18x terminal multiple, as cash flows grow with scale. Risks include high customer 
acquisition costs, entry by larger social networking players and acquiring customers in a 
macro downturn.


Source: Analyst reports
It's not exactly a ringing endorsement for the long-term prospects of the company when the two highest 
level executives decide to sell shares in a little more than a month since coming public, and in the face of an 
acquisition they describe as being excited about. The lock-up is set to expire in August, and a few months 
later PowerReviews' shareholders will also get an opportunity to unload shares. 


If we strip out the fluff of being a "social" and "SaaS" company, and focus on the actual fundamentals of 
BV's business as a struggling marketing services company, we get to a more realistic valuation for the stock. 
In the table below, I've listed the valuations of marketing service and social media companies. On an 
enterprise value to 2012 calendar revenue basis, BV should trade closer to its marketing service peers at 
1.5x - 2.5x revenue and not 8.7x. 











Summary 


BV has a history of burning cash for an extended period of time, and its recently announced deal to acquire 
PowerReviews is expensive, defensive, and does not offer investors a clear roadmap to profitability. 
Competition in the social media marketing and solutions market appears to be intensifying at a rapid pace, 
as evidenced by Salesforce.com's acquisition of Buddy Media and Oracle's purchases of Virtue and 
Collective Intellect. Google is also increasing its social analytics efforts through new and enhanced features.

With the passing of the Facebook IPO and the share price down by 30% from the IPO price, the social media 
craze is showing signs of fizzling fast. The following chart illustrates the post-IPO performance of social 
media stocks and reveals that the average stock price is down by 37%. 











The naked reality that BV is nothing more than a marketing and digital service company will slowly set in. I 
believe the shares should trade at a more reasonable multiple closer to its marketing and digital service 
peers of 1.5x - 2.5x revenues. Other social media companies are already being revalued at this normalized 
multiple. For example, both Groupon and Zynga now trade around 2.0x 2012E revenues. It's also worth 
considering that Facebook, which is the only proven and profitable company in the social media universe, is 
now trading at 11.0x 2012E sales versus BV's 8.7x multiple. 


Therefore, given BV's above average competitive and financial risk, I arrive at a maximum price target of 
approximately $5.64/share.
