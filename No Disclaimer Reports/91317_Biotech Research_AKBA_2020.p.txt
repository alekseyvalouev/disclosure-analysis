WELCOME NEW 
AKEBIA (AKBA) 
SHAREHOLDERS
A CLOSER LOOK AT NEW PHASE 3 DATA SHOWS THAT 
AKEBIA MISSED A CRITICAL TEST, THREATENING NOT ONLY 
ITS COMMERCIAL PROSPECTS BUT ALSO FDA APPROVAL.
An open letter to new Akebia shareholders…
Dear new Akebia shareholder,


Now that you have participated in the financing, it might be time to conduct some due diligence. You should start by asking
Akebia’s CEO John Butler a direct and very simple question:


• Was Vadadustat STATISTICALLY INFERIOR to the standard of care with respect to hemoglobin levels in
addition to being non-inferior based upon the pre-specified margin?


This is a very simple question with a “YES” or “NO” answer—one that was not addressed at all in the company’s press
release or conference call.


After you get an answer (and let us assure you it won’t be the one you are hoping for), you can follow up with this question:


• Is it true that Fibrogen’s Roxadustat was STATISTICALLY SUPERIOR to standard of care with respect to
hemoglobin levels in addition to being non-inferior based upon the pre-specified margin?


Another very simple question with a “YES” or “NO” answer.


Good Luck!
Akebia has a history of omitting key details


• Akebia management seems to ‘forget’ to include key details relating to their 
operations, clinical data and partnerships.


• These details are only revealed when Akebia management slips them into an 
SEC filing (typically a 10-K).  
• In the instances we found, Akebia neglected to file an 8-K to disclose theses details in a 


timely manner, relying instead on the voluminous 10-K filing as “disclosure camouflage”.


• Each time the data makes it way out, Akebia shareholders LOSE.


• We believe that Akebia has not disclosed a critical detail regarding their lead 
program Vadadustat. IT WAS STATISTICALLY INFERIOR TO STANDARD OF CARE 
ESA WITH RESPECT TO MAINTAINING HEMOGLOBIN LEVELS.


We see a clear pattern here with Akebia management:  conveniently “forget” to disclose 
key details in a timely fashion.  When detail comes out, stock goes DOWN.
Material Omission #1:  Insider Trading


• On June 13, 2016, the Department of Justice filed a criminal complaint against Schultz (Jason)
Chan an Akebia employee involved in statistical analysis of clinical trial data.


• The industry press jumped on the matter immediately:


• Can you guess who didn’t disclose the existence of the insider trading case, the details of the
matter, or the outcome?


• AKEBIA MANAGEMENT


Insider trading calls into question a management team’s ability to have adequate controls.  
Failing to disclose the insider trading to investors is egregious.

Material Omission #2:  Mitsubishi Deal
• On December 14, 2015, Akebia management touted a partnership with Mitsubishi on Vadadustat. The


deal was described as having a $100MM contribution from Mitsubishi with $40MM paid upon deal
signing.


• And AKBA’s stock price went up significantly on the announcement:


• When AKBA management *finally* provided the actual details of the Mitsubishi deal in their 2016 10-K,
investors were shocked to find that some critical activities may not be funded by Mitsubishi:


Once the 10-K containing these details was released, AKBA shareholders lost ~11% over 
the next two trading days.

Material Omission #3:  Hy’s Law
• Akebia filed their 2018 10K on May 23, 2019.
• Buried in the filing was the admission that a patient in the Vadadustat arm of a clinical trial suffered a liver


injury classified as a case of Hy’s Law. Hy’s Law is a highly significant NEGATIVE finding in a clinical trial.


• The failure to disclose this in a timely manner is ponderous. The study was completed approximately 4
years before the disclosure. Burying the disclosure in the 2018 10-K without a prior 8-K shows that the
Akebia management team has no respect for its investors. The word “Hy’s” doesn’t even appear in an
Akebia filing until 5/23/2019.


• Even the sell side analysts were curious about the omission (from the Q1:2019 conference call):


Akebia shares dropped ~26% over the 10 trading days following the disclosure.

Are you ready for Material Omission #4?
It involves the recently announced INNO2VATE clinical trial results.


• The INNO2VATE study tested nearly 4,000 patients:
• 3,554 dialysis patients randomized 1:1 to receive either Vadadustat or a standard of care


erythropoietin stimulating agent (SOC ESA)
• 369 incident dialysis patients randomized 1:1 to receive either Vadadustat or a standard of


care erythropoietin stimulating agent (SOC ESA)

• Both Fibrogen’s Roxadustat and Akebia’s
Vadadustat were shown to be non-inferior to
standard of care (ESA) with respect to the
MACE outcome endpoint.


• Fibrogen’s Roxadustat was also shown to be
superior to the SOC ESA with respect to
increasing hemoglobin (Hb) levels.


• HOWEVER, hidden in Akebia’s recent Phase 3
data was the fact that Vadadustat was
statistically inferior to the ESA control group
with respect to maintenance of hemoglobin
levels!


1 SOC ESA is Standard of Care Erythropoietin Stimulating Agents such as Aranesp
Summary of data:  MACE Endpoint
• In the data presented on May 5, Akebia management appeared excited to show investors that Vadadustat


was clearly non-inferior to SOC ESA with respect to the MACE endpoint. This is similar to data presented
by Fibrogen.


Why wasn’t Akebia as excited to show us a similar graph for the hemoglobin (Hb) levels?
Summary of data:  Hemoglobin Endpoint
• Akebia neglected to include a similar slide for Vadudustat vs. ESA with respect to hemoglobin levels, so we 


created our own using the data provided in the press release.  
• Fibrogen is the CLEAR winner here as they were able to demonstrate statistical superiority to ESA.

We see that Akebia’s Vadudustat is statistically inferior to SOC ESA on hemoglobin 
production whereas Fibrogen is statistically superior. 


Akebia’s data shows vadadustat is simultaneously non-
inferior AND STATISTICALLY INFERIOR.

Regulatory concerns
• The FDA has already opined on this subject of interpreting inferiority/superiority curves. From the FDA’s


own guidance documents:


In the FDA’s own words, Akebia’s outcome versus SOC ESA in hemoglobin production 
‘could present interpretive problems’. 


The FDA will have Fibrogen’s data in hand when they 
evaluate Akebia’s data. Is there a good reason to approve a
statistically inferior product when a superior one exists?



https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=FDA-2010-D-0075-0002
Summary
• Akebia is planning to enter a very competitive market dominated by erythropoietin:


• Fibrogen has already submitted their NDA for Roxadustat and utilized a Priority Review Voucher.
• They will have a substantial head start on Akebia
• They have what appears to be superior data


• Akebia has now provided Fibrogen with the necessary clinical data to successfully market against them.
• Both agents showed non-inferiority in the MACE endpoint
• Fibrogen’s Roxadustat showed superiority in the production of hemoglobin versus SOC ESA


whereas Akebia’s vadadustat is inferior.


• Akebia management will claim Vadadustat satisfied the pre-specified non-inferiority mark for
hemoglobin production. HOWEVER, as we have shown they are in fact statistically INFERIOR to SOC
ESA in hemoglobin production.


We think Akebia just handed a huge marketing victory to Fibrogen as Vadadustat is clearly 
inferior to ESAs on the primary efficacy endpoint. When/if HIFs are approved, we 
anticipate Vadadustat will be DOA in the marketplace.
