Summary
LCI management and their sell side lackeys are pumping the stock on a bogus
thesis that hurricane Maria has created significant disruption in the levothyroxine
manufacturing plants in Puerto Rico


We see this as a desperate attempt to pump the stock so that management can
renegotiate the company's debt and get much needed covenant relief


These covenants need to be renegotiated before a new Levothyroxine comes to
market (Lupin has stated that they will be on market by the first quarter)


Although this wont be the first time that LCI has attempted to profit from a potential
drug shortage - it will be only a fleeting benefit to the company


The stock has moved from $18-$24 because of this illogical pump - should be a
quick round trip


Disclaimer: In no way do we intend to downplay the significance of the human toll sholdered by the Puerto Rican people because of


Huricane Maria. This is dedicated to debunking claims made about their inability to rebuild and a company's campaign to profit off of


the storm.

Arthur Bedrosian is the disgraced CEO of LCI, fired by his Board of Directors on Sept
25th., helping to spread a single fallacy regarding his company's ability to profit off of the
natural disaster that was Hurricane Maria. 


The story is simple - Sandoz has a plant that was severely damaged in the storm -
therefore all of the Sandoz clients will have to buy their Levothyroxine from LCI for a six
month period.  This of course would result in a large one time benefit to the company
and might help them get out form under the crushing debt load that Arthur created with
his botched Kremers acquisition (he forgot to put a MAC clause in the contract y'all).  


Unfortunately the Puerto Rico facilities in question are going to be up and ruining
much faster than expected - and it looks like that benefit is going to be rather
inconsequential when new generic competitors hit the market in Q1 (Hint: Lupin). 


Lets peak at how the sell side has aided and abetted this misinformation campaign.


First Raymond James analyst Elliot Willbur:

At least Elliot has enough self respect to leave the duration of the "shortage" up to the
reader, which is more than we can say for Craig Hallum who simply parrots

management and stirs the fear with "one manufacturer will be down for an extended
period of time."


Time to Get Real Cabron!


Lets establish a few facts:


Sandoz doesn't own the facility in question Thermo Fisher (TMO) does via their
Patheon division.


1.


The Patheon plant is located at: Km 2.7 State Road 670, Manati, PR 006742.


People are currently working at the plant3.


Their phones were turned back on yesterday (we called 787-621-2500)4.


And TMO hosted an earnings call yesterday where they played down storm damage
at this particular facility.


5.


The sell side has consistently been citing Guaynabo, PR as the cite of the plant in
question because that's where Novartis (Sandoz parent co.) has a major facility - they
never bothered to check if the drug manufacturing was outsourced. That's a big deal
because Guaynabo suffered significantly more damage than Manati and they are
quite a distance from one another.

Are you thinking what I'm thinking? FIELD TRIP!!!


So what did TMO say on their call about the situation?


So according to google maps this is the plant we are looking for... at least in Feb of 2017
this is what it looked like.


Its about an hour drive from the airport to the Plant and its now been re-branded as a
Thermo Fisher facility.  All pictures are from October, 23rd 2017.

Conclusion:


Parking lot is full as well


We have lots more but you get the point... this facility has power... has phones... has
employees... and is receiving supplies needed to get back up and running.
