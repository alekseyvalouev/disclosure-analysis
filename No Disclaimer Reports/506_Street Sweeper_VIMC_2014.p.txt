Vimicro: James Bond Might Say 'A Storm's Coming' For This Spy
Company

Summary


With the VIMC stock price rising, insiders are screaming, "Sell, sell!" while millions
more in options have expired and stand poised to drop onto the market anytime.


VIMC is a tiny company clawing at a market in China overwhelmingly dominated by
two giants.


Leaders, including one climbing China's social ladder, offer distracted management
to this underperforming company. Yet, company managers' compensation
skyrockets to nearly 7 percent of the company's value.


Additional questions raised by VIMC's complicated related-party deals, plus auditor
and CEO switching. In fact, analysts we interviewed say everything points to the
stock being worth half today's value.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Vimicro International (NASDAQ:VIMC), a Chinese company that makes video cameras for
spying, has fallen under our surveillance. And investors won't like what we've uncovered.


Founded in 1999 in the People's Republic of China, the company's video processing
business quickly declined, and the focus has sharpened on its lower-gross margined
surveillance video systems sold in China.


"It's a fairly boring hardware business," yawned an analyst. "There are companies
hundreds of times better that are in a better position... And over time, Vimicro's
margins are going to shrink further and further."


VIMC's stock gyrations have been anything but boring recently.


In a year of mediocrity, the stock price screamed from a few bucks to the $10 level in a
spillover from investor interest in GoPro's (NASDAQ:GPRO) action camera and the
Ferguson incident, as well as some VIMC hype. The stock is now above the sole analyst's
price target of $10, yet analysts we've spoken with think the stock is worth half that.

For this company, "a storm's coming," as secret agent 007 James Bond said. Here's why
we're blowing the cover on this company that reported a $56 million net loss over the last
three years:


*Insiders racing to sell; millions more shares may be ready to zing investors.


Options for 2.3 million shares at $0.195 expired just last week. That amounts to about 20
percent of outstanding shares.


So that means investors must now watch for massive selling as insiders take advantage of
the stock's blast-off from about $3 in September to about $10 now.


Clearly, it makes no sense for insiders to hold on to those shares much longer.


And wouldn't you know it? Insiders are telling us they're in a selling mood.


Before those options expired, insiders had begun selling as if they thought VIMC had hit
its top - or maybe they began losing confidence in the company's ability to grow. Over
about the past four weeks, company officers dumped nearly a quarter million shares.


Those sobering insider sales are summarized below, based on Bloomberg data taken
from non-electronic Form 144s. Since these forms to register sales of stock are not
electronically submitted, it allows companies to temporarily hide stock sales from investors
and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

*Management gets outrageous pay - and social achievement - for failing
performance


The company rewards pathetic performance, giving away almost 7 percent of the
company's value each year to management.


"The amount of money going to the management team is atrocious," said an analyst who
requested anonymity.


What do investors get in exchange?


Why, VIMC rewards investors by executing money-losing operations in most years.


That's right. Last year, VIMC's net loss rose to $8.7 million. And executives received total
stock and cash compensation of $3.5 million.

TheStreetSweeper discussed these issues with an analyst who is a native speaker of
Chinese Mandarin. He said part of the problem is that the CEO appears most interested in
social engagements and using the company as a step-up on the political and social
ladder, rather than running the company.


The Chinese version of the website backs up the analyst's view. The site spotlights the
CEO and his 2007 achievements, while the number 1 and number 2 ranked competitors
spotlight products and technology.


For example, the photo on the China VIMC homepage, above, shows China's current
president on the left. Shaking his hand is VIMC's current CEO, John Deng.


For comparison, click on the link to Hikvision, the number 1 in market share in China,
where VIMC plays. Listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, Hikvision has a $12 billion
market cap.


Or click on the link to Dahua, number 2 in market share, also listed on the Hong Kong
exchange. Its market cap is $6 billion.


Sadly, VIMC market share is so tiny, no one really tracks it. But a couple of analysts
estimated that VIMC captures a whopping 2 to 3 percent of the China market.


Considering the company's roughly 70 percent of $64 million revenue last year is related
to security cameras, VIMC looks sick compared to Hikvision's $1.7 billion in sales and
Dahua's $871 million.


*Confidence killer: Related-party deals


We're hating related-party deals, and we always have for doggone good reason.

Complex related-party transactions were used to misreport accounting numbers during the
Enron scandal that ultimately ripped up confidence in the financial market itself.


TheStreetSweeper warned about Revolution Lighting Technologies' (NASDAQ:RVLT)
issues, including related-party deals. When we wrote our story last summer, RVLT was
trading for about $4, but now trades for less than $2.


Indeed, we've found VIMC's related-party transactions are among the more complicated
and worrisome ones of all those we've loved to hate through the years, as the snapshots
from an SEC filing indicate below:


VIMC's ugly financial deals extend beyond related-party ones on into audit issues. Despite
the customary "nobody's mad, nothing to see here" language, VIMC apparently ran off
auditing firm Ernst & Young Hua Ming, and without bothering to disclose it on the website,
hired Grant Thornton, China, a firm that audits problematic companies, such as China
Finance Online (JRJC ~$47 in 2007, ~$5 now) and e-Future Information Technology
(EFUT ~$48 in 2007, ~$4 now).


A recent article, here, nicely describes this issue and others, including VIMC's increasing
days sales outstanding and how the company tried to hide the not-so-glamorous track
record of VIMC's revolving door of CEOs.


*Business deals not quite what they seem


VIMC sometimes spins business deals that don't turn out quite as expected. Offering a
glimpse into the related-party issues just mentioned, investors can see that VIMC
disposed of its mobile phone multimedia processor biz to a related party involving two
former key employees - plus VIMC's chief executive Mr. Deng and COO Kevin Jin.

The total amount paid VIMC was to be $4.2 million, but VIMC received only $2.9 million.
VIMC took an 18 percent ownership, but mathematically and logically, should have taken
25 percent.


So we're not sure why VIMC took the $4.2 million restructuring charge. And considering
how it forgave more than $1 million, we can't help but question why VIMC would happily
give up company assets.


And today, VIMC announced a contract win for Chenzhou city in Hunan province.
However, the company did not provide a timeline, suggesting the contract may stretch out
into the next year or so. So it very well may not help much as VIMC tries to meet the 2015
revenue consensus.


Though the press release touts it as a $29.2 million contract, it means only about $14.5
million to VIMC, because the company holds just a 51 percent stake in the joint venture
that received the contract. So this appears to be another primarily promotional effort as
the company tries to prop up the stock.


Investors may find more viewpoints on VIMC HERE.


VIMC has not responded to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment.


*Conclusion


So VIMC insiders have raced to sell this spy company's stock, millions of additional shares
could easily drop onto the market anytime now, and executives are grossly overpaid for
distracted management of an underperformer. Also, the tiny company is an underweight
compared to giant rivals, it switches out auditors and CEOs as a matter of course, and
gives away company assets and deals in those hated related-party transactions.


Two analysts we spoke with consider this stock worth about $4.


We agree with them and James Bond, who once said quite simply, "Appalling."
