UDC misrepresents latest adverse decision, while
other more important EPO opinions go
undisclosed.


Posted on October 16, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, October 16, 2013.  In the late evening two days ago, on


October 14th, Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED)


decided to announce that the European Patent Office (“EPO”) had


“narrow[ed] the scope” of its key patent claims contained in


European Patent No. 1933395 (“EP-395”). UDC issued its press


release almost instantly following a hearing by an EPO Opposition


Division panel that was held earlier the same day, according to EPO


records. None of UDC’s statements about the purported decision are


verifiable, since the EPO has not yet released a written decision (see


EPO docket here), which may take several weeks. Yet at least two


UDC securities analysts took the bait and published erroneous


reports that exacerbated the misunderstanding.


UDC’s announcement should backfire with informed, objective


readers.


UDC’s past disclosures concerning decisions on its patents have


repeatedly obscured their meaning and substantial impact on UDC’s


financial value. Thus any negative admission by UDC is an


indication of the severity of the negative implications of the actual


decision. When an EPO panel invalidated more than half the


original claims in UDC’s cornerstone “key patent”, European Patent


No. 1449238 (“EP-238”) after a hearing exactly like the one that just


occurred, UDC didn’t say a word to investors and only stated in SEC


filings that “the EPO panel announced its decision to maintain the


patent with claims directed to OLEDs comprising phosphorescent


organometallic iridium compounds”, according to UDC’s latest 10-Q.


Again, we reiterate UDC did not put out a press release following


the EPO Opposition Division ruling on EP-238 in 2011, which


Manuel Asensio
doesn’t bet
often. But when
he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

contains UDC’s only known claims of any material economic value,


those pertaining to the use of phosphorescent organometallic


iridium compounds in OLEDs.


The October 14th announcement demonstrates the weakness of


UDC’s claims (the source of this weakness is explained in layman’s


terms using an expert’s insights into the alleged basis of UDC’s


claims and its actual experimental disclosures), even with a patent


like EP-395 that is far narrower than the cornerstone EP-238. The


announcement also confirms the procedural method of dealing


with UDC’s patent trolling where invalidation of claims at the EPO


panel level positions patents for more sweeping invalidation


decisions that are only made by the higher level EPO Boards of


Appeal in complicated trolling cases, rather than the Opposition


Division. The EPO Boards of Appeal will issue a final ruling on EP-


238’s broadest iridium compounds claims after a hearing scheduled


for November 21-22, and based on our research, it is highly likely


that the EPO will revoke EP-238 in its entirety.


UDC is attempting in press releases aimed at investors to downplay


the ability “of any one patent in any one jurisdiction to have a


material impact on the Company’s commercial business.” This is


typical patent troll nonsense. In our view UDC is merely a case of a


complicated and complex stock promotion layered on top of a


combination of an accounting scheme built on a hilariously


outrageous patent troll. And herein lies UDC’s dilemma. It has been


repeatedly forced to contradict itself in legal securities filings. In


this particular case, UDC has actually admitted that just the


existence of patent litigation can damage its patent troll business,


which is its only source of revenue. In SEC filings UDC has admitted


that “the pendency or adverse outcome of any intellectual property


litigation to which we or our licensees are subject could disrupt


business operations, require the incurrence of substantial costs and


subject us or our licensees to significant liabilities, each of which


could severely harm our business. Costs associated with these


actions are likely to increase as AMOLED products using our


[alleged] PHOLED and other OLED technologies and materials enter


the consumer marketplace” [emphasis added].


More importantly, we believe that the invalidation of UDC’s


broadest key patent contained in EP-238 by the Board of Appeal


next month will significantly strengthen real OLED manufacturers’


ability to protect themselves from UDC’s patent troll schemes


through legal “freedom to operate opinions” and will likely trigger


termination clauses in its agreement with Samsung. UDC has not


disclosed any of the termination provisions from its 2011 deal with


Samsung including any renegotiations rights under “most favored


nation” clauses.

While UDC is making statements about an unreleased EPO decision,


the EPO has been issuing other written decisions that are


undeniably negative for UDC. Most importantly, the EPO Board of


Appeal considering EP-238 issued findings in March that strike at


the heart of UDC’s broadest iridium claims, questioning whether


UDC should have claims to “every organometallic iridium


compound” and “every OLED wherein the emissive layer includes a


phosphorescent organometallic iridium or osmium compound”


(emphasis in original).


For yet another UDC key patent under challenge at the EPO, EP-


1394870, the Opposition Division issued an opinion in September


finding that UDC’s most significant claim in that patent was too


broad and unsupported an invention that can be understood much


less allowed under law. Specifically, the opinion states that “neither


the skilled person nor the public have any guidance how to carry


out the alleged invention.”


UDC has not disclosed either of these two above adverse EPO


opinions to investors, nor has any other analyst or reporter


covering UDC. Yet out of the blue UDC issues an unverifiable


proclamation about a loss that merely ratchets up the pressure on


UDC’s patent troll scheme.
