Open Letter to SPRD Chairman re Muddy Waters’ Concerns 


 
Dear Chairman Li: 
 
Muddy Waters, LLC has begun researching SPRD, and we have taken a short position in 
it.  (Please see our disclaimer on the last page.)  We have identified a number of issues in 
SPRD’s filings, and we believe that there is a high risk of material misstatement in the 
reported financials since the time of Dr. Ping Wu’s resignation.  Our concerns are gravest 
regarding 2010 and 2011 numbers.   
 
We are writing you an open letter so that our concerns and hopefully your responses are 
transparent to SPRD shareholders.  The following letter contains questions relating to 
many of our areas of concern.  Should you send us your response, we are happy to 
disseminate it. 
 


I. SPRD reported that revenue increased 229.6% in 2010, after generally being 
flat in 2007-2009.   Can you please explain the sales increase in light of the 
following 2009 management changes: 


 
o Founder Ping Wu resigned as CEO in February 2009.   According to a 


July 2010 interview in a respected business publication,1 Mr. Wu resigned 
because the board had lost confidence in him.  SPRD’s sales cycle is four 
to nine months2 and the turnaround began almost immediately after Mr. 
Wu resigned – revenue grew quarter over quarter in Q3 2009 by 136.6%.  
Therefore, the improved sales pipeline would have been evident under Mr. 
Wu.   


 Why would the board have lost confidence in Mr. Wu when the 
sales pipeline was so promising? 


 
o We note that CFO Richard Wei resigned in April 2009, which was one 


month before SPRD completed a $44 million financing. 
 Because it would be unusual to fire a CFO during the financing 


process, is it fair to assume that he chose to leave? 
 If “yes”, why would he have left with such strong sales in the 


pipeline?

II. MediaTek (2454.TW) had approximately 90% of the mainland China mobile 
handset chip market in 2009.  Mobile handset chips are by far its largest 
revenue source – currently accounting for more than 70% of revenue.3  
Estimates now place MediaTek’s mainland market share at only 70%, with 
SPRD at 20% (an increase of about 15 percentage points).  (It appears that 
these estimates are based in part on SPRD’s reported numbers.)  However, 
MediaTek reported that its 2010 revenue decreased by 1.4%.   
 
For MediaTek, which relies heavily on mobile handset chips, to have reported 
a sales decline of only 1.4% while seemingly losing 15 percentage points of 
market share to SPRD, the mainland China market for mobile handset chips 
must have grown substantially in 2010.   
 
However, we note that both SPRD and MediaTek faced headwinds as 
mainland China authorities cracked down in 2010 on gray market handset 
manufacturers.  At the high end of the market, Qualcomm (NASDAQ: 
QCOM) only grew its 2010 revenue 5.5%.   
 
By how much did SPRD’s mainland China markets (by product type) grow in 
2010? 
 


III. SPRD’s disclosure related to its 2010 revenue is unhelpful and opaque.  The 
2009 20-F disclosed RF transceiver and baseband semiconductor sales figures.  
However, the 2010 20-F does not discuss sales of these products.  Instead the 
2010 20-F discusses the percentage gains for sales of all bundled 
semiconductors (without ascribing any dollar values).   
 
We take issue with the opaque 2010 disclosure because we believe that issuers 
should provide “apples to apples” information in successive periods, and the 
2010 disclosure is frankly vague and unhelpful. 


 
What were 2010 sales of RF transceivers, baseband semiconductors, and any 
other products SPRD began selling in 2010? 
 


IV. SPRD’s lack of any cash income tax payment in 2010 is inconsistent with 
prior years as well as the PRC’s provisional tax payment requirements.  The 
table below shows SPRD’s pre-tax income, income tax provisions, and cash 
taxes paid for 2008 – 2010.

The PRC Enterprise Income Tax law requires that companies pay provisional 
income tax on a monthly or quarterly basis.  Companies must file a 
provisional tax return within 15 days of the close of the month or quarter 
along with the provisional payment.   
 
If SPRD generated $75.3 million in pre-tax profit in 2010, why didn’t it make 
any cash tax payments? 


 
V. The near simultaneous turnover in 2009 among SPRD’s CFO, audit 


committee, and auditor is troubling.  In October 2009, SPRD’s CFO, David 
Wu, resigned after only four months in the role.  This was the second CFO in 
2009 to resign.  In September 2009, audit committee member Ken Lu resigned 
from the board.  In September 2009, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu was 
“removed” as auditor, and replaced by another Big Four auditor, 
PriceWaterhouseCoopers Zhong Tian.   
 
Given that the turnover occurred while SPRD was in the midst of a stunning 
turnaround, did the resignations and removal have anything to do with 
discomfort about SPRD’s accounting?  If not, what were the reasons each 
resigned (or was removed in the case of Deloitte)? 
 


VI. We note that the sizes of five balance sheet / cash flow statement accounts 
grew tremendously in 2010.  These accounts are among those that we consider 
high risk because they are primarily evidenced by paper documentation, rather 
than their physical presence (as in machinery and equipment).  The abundance 
of paper accounts on the balance sheet was one of the early signs to us that 
Rino International Corp. was a fraud.  It is clear that auditors in China are 
having significant problems evaluating the veracity of documents. 
 
As discussed infra, we note that 44.8% of SPRD’s 2010 year-end inventory is 
“deferred cost”, which means that the inventory has been shipped to 
customers, but has not yet been booked as revenue.  We therefore assume that 
the auditors did not lay eyes on most (if not all) of the deferred cost inventory. 
 
The cash flow statement accounts that bother us the most because of their 
unusual sizes in 2010 (compared to earlier years) are shown below – note that 
all are operating cash flow accounts. 
 
 





6/28/2011 Page 3
As a general matter, can you explain why the size (in absolute value terms) of 
each of these accounts is much larger than in the past?  What processes did the 
auditors undertake to confirm the sizes of each of these accounts? 
 


VII. Among the accounts shown in the prior question, we are most concerned 
about the increases in inventory (especially the deferred cost sub-account) and 
advances from customers.  We believe that having enormous simultaneous 
increases in advances from customers and deferred costs is implausible. 
 


 
 
A blogger recently stated that SPRD’s new clients are being given up to 90 
days to inspect the chips because SPRD is a new supplier,4 which is the reason 
for the deferred cost.  If SPRD agrees with that assessment, we are a bit 
perplexed as to how SPRD would maintain good relationships with its 
existing clients – presumably they would be unhappy with the preferential 
treatment being given to new clients.  We note that MediaTek has no deferred 
cost account, and thus does not appear to extend this policy.  The rationale 
that new customers want the inspection period because SPRD is a new 
supplier also strikes us as odd because SPRD and its main competitor 
MediaTek are fabless semiconductor companies.  SPRD’s chips are assembled 
by TSMC.  Supplier-specific product defects would therefore be more likely 
due to design issues than manufacturing, and SPRD’s 20-F indicates that 
clients test the designs before ordering.5 
 
Why have each of advances from customers and deferred cost become so 
significant?   


 
VIII. We question the wisdom of paying $32.58 million for a 48.44% stake in 


MobilePeak, which appears to be a distressed company.   
 


MobilePeak appears to be a distressed company that had an urgent need for 
liquidity.  Rather than completing this acquisition in one step, SPRD

purchased only 48.44% of MobilePeak for $32.58 million.  SPRD disclosed 
that it “intends to purchase”6 the remaining equity by the conclusion of Q3.  
As part of the initial purchase, SPRD loaned MobilePeak money to pay off its 
convertible bridge loan.   
 
Per the below SAIC financials, MobilePeak generates virtually no revenue, 
has negative net income, and has negative operating cash flow.  
Management’s recent comment7 that it is “too early” to discuss MobilePeak’s 
customers indicates that MobilePeak’s current revenue is still de minimis. 
 


 
 
MobilePeak’s investors include Sequoia, KPCB, and IDG,8 yet it was 
evidently left to SPRD to provide liquidity to MobilePeak to repay a loan.  
Given that MobilePeak’s shareholders chose to sell the company rather than 
provide it with liquidity, we infer that they doubt its potential.  Further, given 
that SPRD is using cash to fund the purchase rather than shares, we infer that 
MobilePeak’s shareholders do not see substantial synergies in the transaction. 
 
Is SPRD acquiring MobilePeak in two stages because MobilePeak had an 
urgent need for liquidity?  Why is SPRD acquiring a company that evidently 
was unable to raise additional funds from its existing investors?  Given that 
SPRD’s previous acquisition of Quorum Systems from large venture capital 
investors resulted in impairment charges of $49.8 million (71.1%)9 within the 
same year of completing the acquisition, what assurance can you offer that the 
MobilePeak acquisition will be more successful? 
 


IX. The increase in ADSes since going public implies that insiders have been 
selling shares at various times. We note that SPRD recently announced a share 
buyback of up to $100 million. Should we expect that shareholder funds will 
be used to purchase shares that insiders are selling?

We appreciate your answering our questions, and we believe that SPRD shareholders will 
also appreciate it.  Please address your response to: info@muddywatersresearch.com.  
For your convenience, the following is a summary of the questions we have asked in this 
letter.   
 
Best regards, 
Carson Block 
 
 


1. Per the interview with Mr. Wu, the board lost confidence in him.  Why would the 
board have lost confidence in Mr. Wu when the sales pipeline was so promising? 


2. Is it fair to assume that Mr. Wei voluntarily left his position as CFO? 
3. If so, why would he have done so one month before completing the financing, and 


with such a promising sales pipeline? 
4. By how much did SPRD’s mainland China markets (by product type) grow in 


2010? 
5. What were 2010 sales of RF transceivers, baseband semiconductors, and any 


other products SPRD began selling in 2010? 
6. If SPRD generated $75.3 million in pre-tax profit in 2010, why didn’t it make any 


cash tax payments? 
7. Given that the turnover in the auditor, audit committee, and CFO position 


occurred while SPRD was in the midst of a stunning turnaround, did the 
resignations and removal have anything to do with discomfort about SPRD’s 
accounting?   


8. If not, what were the reasons each resigned (or was removed in the case of 
Deloitte)? 


9. As a general matter, can you explain why the size (in absolute value terms) of 
each of the operating cash flow accounts we highlighted is much larger than in the 
past?   


10. What processes did the auditors undertake to confirm the sizes of each of these 
accounts? 


11. Why have each of advances from customers and deferred cost become so 
significant?   


12. Is SPRD acquiring MobilePeak in two stages because MobilePeak had an urgent 
need for liquidity?   


13. Why is SPRD acquiring a company that evidently was unable to raise additional 
funds from its existing investors?   


14. What assurance can you offer that the MobilePeak acquisition will be more 
successful than the Quorum Systems acquisition? 


15. Should we expect that shareholder funds will be used to purchase shares that 
insiders are selling?
