WOULD DELOITTE SIGN
THE DEED TO THE
BROOKLYN BRIDGE?


Citron Research is amazed at the amount that has
been written on China MediaExpress
(NASDAQ:CCME).  But amid all the noise, everyone
seems to be overlooking the obvious doubt that
should lie in the minds of shareholders, short
sellers, and most importantly their auditors.  
Yesterday, in the most de�nitive piece of research
since the controversy boiled over, analyst Ping
Luo explained that CCME’s “unique approach has
made them less visible but kept them very
pro�table”.


What she doesn’t mention is that if CCME’s
numbers are to be believed, they would be the
most operationally successful company in the
world, on a percentage basis, on the whole stock
exchange…..EVER.


Instead of refuting the Global Hunter piece on its
many inconsistencies and omissions, we are
asking everyone to stop, breathe, and use a little
common sense. As this report is being written,
Citron is sure that the diligent employees of China
MediaExpress are “cooperating” with Deloitte
Touche audit personnel as they execute the
annual audit of the company’s �nancials for its
10-K due in just ten days.  We would like to

congratulate Deloitte for having been chosen
auditor of this most successful company.


China MediaExpress is not your average
company:  it has leaped past Google, Apple, and
Microsoft in most fundamental metrics for
judging successful companies:  return on assets
and pro�t ( if you are to believe the numbers). 
 Meanwhile, they have done all of this without
ever attracting any material attention in
mainstream business news in either the US or
China .   We are supposed to believe they have
built a company under the radar that will be
studied in business schools for the next 100 years
— all without  having a traditional underwriter for
an IPO or top tier analyst coverage.   Maybe
Goldman Sachs is just intimidated by their
success?


How did this happen?    Did they start a search
engine that took over the country?   Did they �nd
a huge gold deposit?  A giant gusher of oil?  
Maybe they started a social network that was so
compelling they made a movie about it.   Nope. 
They sell advertising on buses to lower income
people in rural China … people whose average
income is around $200 a month.


And who are their customers?  Well that is a
company secret intentionally kept from Wall
Street.   In a recent piece of research put out by
Global Hunter, we are told that the company does
not want to disclose its customers, so the analyst
just lists them as:

Competition?  Bring on the world!
We challenge anyone from Deloitte, or for that
matter any shareholder of China MediaExpress, to
identify a single credible telecommunication,
media, or technology (TMT) company that has
operating margins or return on assets even in the
same league with CCME. The closest we found
was BIDU, whom CCME still beats by 25% … a
country mile in stock market terms.


So here you go.   All of these �gures came directly
from Yahoo �nance so you can check them for
yourself.   Citron compares CCME in 3 di�erent
sectors: US Market leaders, China leaders, and
their direct competition in public venue
advertising.  What makes these comparisons so
compelling is that in the sharp-pencil world of
corporate competition, even 3-10% di�erential is
enormous.   But CCME just blows past everyone. 
It would be equivalent to a major league baseball
player batting .700 … and hitting 100 home runs!





CCME compared to world-class respected
companies

CCME compared to Chinese high growth
companies





CCME compared to stated Chinese competitors 
(plus Lamar in the US for comparison)


We are asked to believe that for every dollar
invested in the business, CCME returns over 50c
per year.  If Enron had been reporting returns like
that, how long would they have lasted?  Not only
that, they have accomplished this feat without
any substantial institutional ownership or analyst
coverage.


If  this scale of pro�tability does not invoke some
level of professional skepticism as mandated by
the PCAOB or its Hong Kong counterpart, then we

can con�dently state that Deloitte is a
collaborator in the fraud.  And yes, we welcome a
challenge from Deloitte on that statement.

A Brief History Lesson
In 2005, Deloitte was �ned $50 million for their
part in the Adelphia fraud.
http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-65.htm
[https://www.sec.gov/news/press/2005-65.htm]


The SEC stated that:


“Even though Deloitte identi�ed Adelphia
as one of its highest risk clients, Deloitte
failed to design an audit appropriately
tailored to address audit risk areas that
Deloitte had explicitly identi�ed.”


Deloitte has actually released a study on
corporate fraud that could serve as a handbook
to the local auditors on the job at CCME.

Citron notes that the Telecommunication, Media,
and Technology industry (TMT) is called out as
most vulnerable to fraud and the most common
type of fraud is revenue recognition.  The �ne
people of Deloitte should study this document
closely before electing China MediaExpress into
the “business hall of fame”.


Conclusion
All of this reminds this writer of being a kid
watching David Copper�eld make the Statue of
Liberty disappear.  As a stared at my television in
