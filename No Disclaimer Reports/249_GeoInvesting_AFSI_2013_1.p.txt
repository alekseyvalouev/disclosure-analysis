AmTrust Financial Services: A House Of Cards?
Dec. 12, 2013 10:51 AM ET88 comments
by: The GeoTeam


We believe short sellers have the winning position in AmTrust Financial Services
(NASDAQ:AFSI). Owners of AFSI should take careful note of the discussions of
consolidation of earnings and valuation of assets that could result in large losses and
regulatory scrutiny for the company.


AFSI is a multinational insurance company headquartered in New York City that provides
specialty property and casualty insurance to small and medium businesses. AFSI's
primary business lines include worker's compensation, commercial automobile, general
liability, extended warranty, UK legal expense and Italian medical malpractice coverage.
The company also invests in life settlement contracts ("LSCs").


It seems suspicious that a company could take on so many different types of risk while
beating consensus estimates for 14 consecutive quarters. We find it difficult to believe that
AFSI could quickly enter areas where they had no previous experience and at such a
pace without ever missing a step. This has led us to take a deeper look into AFSI's books
and accounting. The SEC has been very active in investigating LSC investments (GWG
Holdings is now under investigation), and we think they will be very interested in AFSI's
valuation of LSCs and the reported profits from the LSC portfolio.


In addition to LSC-related mark to market gains, it appears that management is
ceding/sending losses to offshore captive reinsurance companies it has purchased since
2009, but not disclosing these losses in SEC financial statements as required.


We will show that AFSI appears to be inflating earnings/net equity via offshore
entities, making it difficult for regulators to see the complete picture and/or get accurate
information. We think that AFSI could be next in line to face regulatory scrutiny.


Summary of Findings


1. A cross section of public documents (AFSI SEC filings, Statutory financial filings by
AFSI subsidiaries and Credit Rating information) shows that AFSI appears to be
excluding losses of wholly-owned subsidiaries in its SEC filings


2. From 2009 to 2012 we believe that AFSI has not disclosed a total of $276.9
million in losses ceded to Luxembourg subsidiaries.

3. AFSI seems to be mismarking its LSCs by using egregiously aggressive assumptions
relative to peers despite lawsuit documents showing AFSI holds many policies which
are probably worthless.


4. Applying industry standard discount rates would result in an
impairment/markdown of $90-$135 million in AFSI LSCs.


5. These findings regarding AFSI's LCSs are especially troublesome since more than half
of the policies held by AFSI are of contracts where Phoenix Life Insurance,
(NYSE:PNX) (see footnote 1) is the issuing carrier / counterparty. Since PNX and/or
its subsidiaries are faced with possible bankruptcy, its ability to honor the payout on
these policies could be diminished and AFSI's expected collection on these contracts
would be even less than other comparable policies.


6. Press releases contain different accounts than those reported in SEC filings, leading
us to question the company's internal controls over financial reporting.


7. We conclude that AFSI is worth between $3.87 and $13.00 per share.


Additionally, AFSI CFO Ronald Pipoly & COO Michael Saxon were executive officers at
Credit General ("CGI"), a P&C insurance company that was liquidated in 2001 by the Ohio
insurance regulator after it was revealed that the CEO, Robert Lucia, had committed fraud
via related party offshore entities and stolen $30 million from the company.


Insurance Industry Is No Stranger to Fraud


The complexity of insurance accounting as well as the latitude management teams can
use in the accounting for certain items can make it difficult to detect fraudulent or risky
behavior. Mutual Benefit (private), EEA Life settlements Fund (private), Absolute Life
Solutions (once a public company), and Life Partners Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:LPHI) are
examples of companies that had their feet in the toxic life settlement insurance sector and
whose accounting tricks eventually were detected. This led to a massive destruction of
investor capital.


Just recently, shares of Tower Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:TWGP) imploded shortly before and
after an August 7, 2013 announcement that the company was delaying its 10-Q to
reevaluate issues related to reserves, the integration of its Canopius Bermuda merger,
and its integration of goodwill and certain tax accounts. The events surrounding these
issues led to over $700 million in charges incurred upon TWGP and a credit rating
downgrade by insurance rating agency A.M. Best.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 3/41


In order to understand AFSI, it's important to comprehend its organizational structure,
summarized below:


The subsidiaries (or groups of subsidiaries and parent) in blue do not directly participate in
insurance underwriting. The subsidiaries (or groups of subsidiaries) in green are AFSI's
regulated insurance subsidiaries which can write policies directly. The subsidiaries (or
groups of subsidiaries) in red are "captive" reinsurance subsidiaries.


Regulatory and Accounting "Arbitrage"


A captive reinsurance company is wholly owned by an affiliated entity (in AFSI's case, the
parent) to insure the risks of its other insurance subsidiaries under the same corporate
umbrella. Captive reinsurance subsidiaries are used to shift profits to lower tax
jurisdictions or to reduce capital requirements. By using captives, they need to have fewer
reserves to pay out policy holders that need to collect, and can instead take more risk than
they otherwise could if they stayed at home.


Since AFSI voluntarily gave up the tax benefits associated with this structure (see
footnote 3), we guess the benefit for AFSI is capital-related. We believe AFSI is
interested in Bermuda in order to shield operations from the view of investors, regulators
and ratings agencies.


The Luxembourg Cookie Jar


AFSI uses an offshore captive reinsurer called AmTrust International Insurance ("All") in
Bermuda to off lay of more than half of its contracts. We believe it is doing this not only lay
off the risk, but to in effect hide the eventual losses from this risk. Under All sits a
Luxembourgian domicile captive insurer called ACHL. We believe AFSI is using this web
of subsidiaries to move bad policies and conceal losses. Here is a snapshot showing loss

and premium information from 2010 through 2012 comparing AFSI SEC financial
information to AM Best data and a statutory filing from (Schedule Y) of one of its wholly
owned subs, Technology Insurance Company ("TIC").


Table Items Defined: 
NPW = Net Premiums Written 
NPE = Net Premiums Earned 
Net L/LAE = Net Loss/Loss Adjusted Expense 
AEL = AFSI's UK subsidiary 
AIUL = AFSI's Irish subsidiary 
AII = AFSI's Bermuda subsidiary 
ACHL = AFSI's Luxembourg subsidiary 
TIC = One of AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries


Referencing the last column of the table above, we can see that AFSI is not consolidating
the losses ceded to ACHL (see footnote 4), but appears to be recognizing premiums
associated with those policies. As you can see, the 10-K reconciles when it comes to
premiums. But when it comes to recognizing losses, those do not appear to be present in
the 10-K. The mismatch approximates the losses being sent to Luxembourg, so it would
appear to us that AFSI is not recognizing certain losses in its SEC filings.


AIUL's 2009 AM Best report is not available, so we're unable to perform the same
exercise for 2009. We will revisit this table later in our report and also present evidence
that AFSI also did not consolidate losses into ACHL in 2009.


GAAP Accounting Shenanigans

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 5/41


We believe that AFSI is inappropriately taking advantage of differences between U.S.
GAAP and Luxembourg GAAP to create a cookie jar for earnings. In brief, AFSI's
Bermuda subsidiary ("AII Bermuda") "stuffs" losses into "ACHL", yet keeps the premiums.


Let's look at the clear evidence that has led us to conclude that AII Bermuda is ceding
losses to ACHL, and that the results reported to investors do not accurately portray this
fact.


In simple terms, we believe AFSI acquires shell companies that have built up
"equalization" balances for smoothing future earnings that are recognized in Luxembourg
GAAP, but not US GAAP (see footnote 5). Then AFSI appears to inappropriately
incorporate the results of Luxembourg entities under Luxembourg GAAP (which allows the
use of these smoothing balances) instead of what the results would have been under U.S.
GAAP (which does not allow the use of smoothing balances). Basically, Luxembourg
GAAP allows these smoothing balances to offset future losses vs. U.S. GAAP that
prohibits this practice specifically because these balances allow companies to avoid
reporting losses on financial statements. Thus, real losses AFSI is sending/"smoothing
out" in Luxembourg are not being reported in the results AFSI reports in its SEC filings.
We believe this is why AFSI has spent $730.9 million buying Luxembourg captives - it is
the key to being able to report steady profit growth.


Origin Luxembourg "Equalization" Balances


AFSI did not incur the equalization balances. Instead, they purchased entities that already
had the balances built up.


This all started in 2009 when AFSI bought Imagine Captive Holdings Limited
(subsequently renamed AmTrust Capital Holdings Limited or "ACHL"), a Luxembourg
holding company which owned three Luxembourg-domiciled captive insurance companies
("Luxembourg Captives"). They proceeded to purchase another 8 entities through 2012.
The full list is below:
5/23/2018 AmTrust Financial Services: A House Of Cards? - AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 6/41


In total, AFSI paid $730.92 million to buy Luxembourg-domiciled entities that had
approximately $688 million (see footnote 6) of "equalization" balances.


We have no problem with AFSI's purchase of the entities as long as the parent company
is properly recognizing subsequent intra-company transactions appropriately under US
GAAP. However, we believe AFSI is not recognizing these intra-company losses correctly
-- most likely by mixing and matching Luxembourg GAAP and US GAAP.


In the following two sections we will show that magnitude of losses (that ACHL is
absorbing and clearly not disclosing) by comparing its financial statements presented in
SEC filings with the public filings of its subsidiaries. We will also show that ACHL is
receiving no premiums.


Proof That ACHL Received Zero Premiums


AII Bermuda's 2010 financial statements break out premiums assumed and premiums
ceded for 2009/2010, which we show below.

Proof That Losses Exist


Statutory filings of AII Bermuda


The statutory filings of AII Bermuda in 2010 (the only year they are publicly available)
show a mysterious $62.1 million dollars of losses being ceded to Luxembourg in
2010 and $31.8 million in 2009. The following are pictures from AII Bermuda regulatory
filings in 2009 and 2010:

The statutory filings of AFSI's wholly owned subsidiary, Technology Insurance Company,
confirm the AII Bermuda 2010 Financials disclosure - to the dollar. Specifically, the
following table shows that $62.1 million was sent to ACHL in 2010 which matches the net
loss ceded figure in the above table of AII Bermuda. We then present two additional tables
from TIC statutory filings showing that a total of $183 million of losses was ceded to
ACHL throughout 2011 and 2012.

Dipping into the Cookie Jar - Unconsolidated Losses


We are willing to accept that if the losses are being ceded, this is not necessarily a big
problem as long as AFSI reports those losses on the 10-K and consolidates them for US
GAAP purposes. However, they do not appear to be consolidated and so net income
appears to be overstated.


Not In the Net Loss Expense Line


The table below compares the AII Bermuda Financial statements for 2010 to the AM Best
report for AII Bermuda in 2010 and shows that AM Best is basing ratings on the AII
Bermuda financial statements:

statements, showing the data points:

Source: Filed by AII Bermuda


This confirms the validity of the AII Bermuda 2010 financial statements that show losses
being ceded to ACHL from AII Bermuda as AM Best does not recognize the losses ceded
to ACHL either. It also provides us with a consistent data source to compare the
subsidiaries' net earned premium and net loss and loss adjustment expense to the 10-K
since AM Best reports are available for AFSI's insurance subsidiaries (US Subsidiaries are
filed as a group) with the exception of ACHL.


However, since we can derive ACHL's results from the AII Bermuda 2010 Financial
statements and Schedule Y of AFSI's US Statutory subsidiaries' filings, we can check to
see if all net earned premiums and net loss and loss adjustment expenses are
consolidated in the 10-K. If it were being consolidated properly, the losses ceded to ACHL
would be present in the disclosed aggregated net loss numbers reported, yet they are not,
and they appear to be off by roughly the same amounts that are being sent to
Luxembourg.


The tables below are the result of that exercise for 2010, 2011, and 2012. AIUL's 2009 AM
Best report is not available, so we're unable to perform the same exercise for 2009. The
tables clearly show that AFSI is not consolidating the losses ceded to ACHL (see
footnote 7):

Table Items Defined: 
NPW = Net Premiums Written 
NPE = Net Premiums Earned 
Net L/LAE = Net Loss/Loss Adjusted Expense 
AEL = AFSI's UK subsidiary 
AIUL = AFSI's Irish subsidiary 
AII = AFSI's Bermuda subsidiary 
ACHL = AFSI's Luxembourg subsidiary 
TIC = One of AFSI's U.S. subsidiaries


Notice that Net Premiums Written ("NPW") , and Net Premiums Earned ("NPE") of
GroupSubs (US Subs, AEL, AIUL, AII, ACHL) for each year closely approximates the
consolidated 10-K disclosures, giving us comfort that no material entities are missing
when we try to back into the earned premium and loss numbers disclosed in the 10-K.


However, also note that Net loss and Loss Adjustment Expense (Net L/LAE) of the
GroupSubs, is $290 million higher than what is disclosed in the AFSI's 10-Ks, and that
$245 million of this discrepancy comes from ACHL. We are not choosing to believe
that AFSI got it right on premiums and wrong on losses. Thus, given the known data
points, we can only assume that AFSI did not disclose $245 million of ceded losses in its
SEC filed financials from 2010 to 2012.


Furthermore, adding the 2010 to 2012 ceded losses ($245 million) to ACHL
(Luxembourg) referenced in the above table to the losses ceded ($31.8 million) to ACHL
per AII Bermuda's statutory filing 2009 earlier in our report works out to about $276.9

million.


This comparison clearly indicates that the results AFSI reports to investors significantly
understate the loss expense (thereby significantly overstating income).


2010 Net Loss Reserves in 10-K Exclude ACHL


Thus far, we have primarily focused on income statement analysis to support our
conclusions. But we can also reference balance sheet items to show that AFSI is not
recognizing AII Luxembourg loss items, such as net loss reserves. Taking a look at ASFI's
2010 10-K, we can calculate net loss reserves from page F-3 (amounts in thousands):


[Loss and loss expense reserves ($1,263,537)] + [Reinsurance payable on paid losses
($11,343)] - [Reinsurance Recoverable ($775,432)] = $499,448.


Now, it appears that ACHL's net loss LAE reserves are not incorporated in AFSI's 10-K,
even though AII Bermuda has disclosed that ACHL has L/LAE has reserves of 93.975 in
its filings.


The reported loss reserves in the 10-K ($499.448 million) are different from the sum of
subsidiary loss reserves ($592.88 million) by the exact amount sitting at ACHL ($93.975
million). This is potentially a $93.43 million hole in the AFSI balance sheet. See below
from AII Bermuda financial statements:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 14/41


Using the same AM Best filings we have been using throughout our article, we can also
show that ACHL's net loss reserves appear to not be reflected in AFSI's 2010 10K. As one
would expect, since the premium earned ties out (as discussed earlier), unearned
premiums tie out between Am Best and 10k from the above table, it is revealing that net
loss reserves do not even closely match.


Information GAAP - Investors & Ratings agencies Need More Data Points to
Properly Assess Luxembourg Risk


We believe that the company is not recognizing the losses to make reported earnings look
better. This could also lead to downgrades from AM Best, as AM Best's ratings
assumptions use the net losses and loss adjustments that match unconsolidated
financials and therefore do not include the full financial results.


AFSI should provide additional Information regarding losses ceded to Luxembourg to the
public and ratings agencies. The financial data AM Best uses to assign a credit rating to
AFSI match what is in AFSI's 10-K, so it seems ACHL's losses are not part of the ratings
evaluation process (AFSI supplies AM Best with statutory filings).


Comparing the 2010 financial statements of AII Bermuda, which show ceded net losses to
ACHL of $62.1 million, with the 2010 AM Best report for AII Bermuda (see previously
discussed 'AM Best + ACHL Comparison to SEC Filings'), we see that the net loss &
loss adjustment expense of $249.5 million matches. Therefore, the net loss expense
shown in the AM Best report (appropriately based on their methodology) excludes the
losses of AII Bermuda's wholly owned subsidiary, ACHL, and only takes into account the
reported unconsolidated numbers.


Life Settlement Mismarking


AFSI appears to be boosting earnings and tangible book value by marking up its portfolio
of life settlement contracts ("LSCs"). LSC, net of non-controlling interest now represent
approximately 19% of AFSI's tangible book value. In valuing an LSC portfolio, the discount
rate and life expectancy ("LE") are the two most critical inputs. AFSI uses a 7.5% discount
rate to value its LSCs while peers use a rate approximately 20%. Applying industry
standard discount rates would result in a mark down of $90-135 million, or roughly 13-19%

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1894851-amtrust-financial-services-a-house-of-cards 15/41


of AFSI's tangible equity. Further, it appears that AFSI relies on internal estimates, only
considering third party estimates for the LE input (See 10-Q for the period ended
September 30, 2013, page 17). In contrast, best practice is to use third party estimates to
determine LE estimates and weight them towards the more conservative estimate. The
use of internal LE estimates has been a staple of past frauds in the LSC industry (notably,
Life Partners and Mutual Benefits).


AFSI has been revising down its LE assumptions, generating gains on its LSC portfolio.
Publicly traded peers are revising their LE assumptions higher (especially for the
premium-financed LSC paper that AFSI holds) (see footnote 8). Simply put, peers are
assuming people are living longer while AFSI assumes people are going to die sooner.
We are unaware of any reason why AFSI is taking a non-consensus view on lifespans of
Americans. It is possible that AFSI's policyholders en masse have decided to take up
smoking, skydiving, or ride motorcycles without their helmets, but given a diverse base of
people, this seems unlikely despite what AFSI management is asking the market to
believe if you accept its LSC valuations.


More than half of AFSI's LSC portfolio consists of contracts where Phoenix Life Insurance
is the issuing carrier/counterparty . Faced with possible bankruptcy, PNX has been
attempting to induce holders of its LSC paper to lapse on their policies by hiking premiums
& denying death benefits. Given the possibility that PNX death benefits will not be paid,
when PNX paper does trade, it trades for pennies on the dollar.


For example, Fortress described the market for Phoenix policies in a complaint filed
August, 2012 as follows:


"As a result of Defendants' anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct, there are very
few, if any, buyers who remain willing to purchase Phoenix life insurance policies on
the secondary market. Defendants' anticompetitive and exclusionary conduct, and
the resulting uncertainty it has created, has destroyed the value of Phoenix policies
and robbed policyholders of the once-precious ability to sell their policies in a
competitive market. The few buyers who do remain will only buy Phoenix policies at
severe discounts..."


Tiger Capital LLC, an AFSI sub, filed a lawsuit against Phoenix in 2012. In recent days,
Tiger Capital's court documents showed it held 136 Phoenix LSCs. In their third quarter
2013 10-Q, AFSI disclosed 81 of the policies it held are carried at "no value", including
those policies that have a negative NPV. This implies that a minimum 55 of the Phoenix

policies (136 minus 81) have been assigned value despite there being essentially no
buyers for these policies. Marking these LSCs to true market value would result in a
significant impairment.


AFSI suggests that marking its LSC book at $194 million is conservative; since this
represents a 17.7% IRR based on $795 million in future cash flows. But, if one were to
apply the same LE standard peers use, this $795 million would be lower since longer LEs
require more premiums to be paid before the death benefit is received. By shortening LE,
the policy holder gets to "double dip" by using fewer years in the present value calculation
and by assuming less premiums paid. The effect is not simply an adjustment based on
discount rate. The true amount of future net cash flows, calculated using peer
assumptions, then, would be closer to $439 million (after applying the reserves that,
essentially, make AFSI's LE methodology comparable with peers).


The peer group calculation would then be to discount the $439 million by 17.7% or more,
rather than the 7.5% discount rate AFSI uses. We estimate that AFSI's LSC would be
worth $90 - $135 million less if they used the same discount rate as peers based on their
disclosed sensitivity to changes in the discount rate assumption.


In fact, since Phoenix policies (they make up the policies in the LSC portfolio) trade at
cents on the dollar, an appropriate discount rate is probably 50-60%.


Finally, despite claiming to set reserves based on LEs calculated by outside data
providers, management does not address why its own LE assumptions have been falling
(generating portfolio gains) while peers, who rely on the same data providers, are revising
their LEs upward. As we said earlier, it could be that the people associated with contracts
owned by AFSI are becoming riskier.


See the below chart for a display of comparable companies and the discount rates they
use. Note that the one company, EEA LS Fund (Full Credibility) that uses a discount rate
assumption (10.0%) closest to AFSI's (7.5%) has been warned by its auditor Ernst &
Young, that the discount rate is "significantly lower than what would be used by
market participants in an arm's-length transaction":

We wonder what E&Y would have to say if they were to replace BDO as AFSI's auditor?


AFSI Disclosure Discrepancies


Amtrust frequently has discrepancies between the balance sheet items presented in press
releases and SEC filings. However, the adjustments made to the balance sheet have not
resulted in changes to Shareholders' Equity, Goodwill & Intangibles, or the Income
Statement items.


The discrepancies could have offsetting entries as appears to be the case in the first
quarter of 2009 where adjustments to assets and liabilities offset. Additionally, the press
release only includes certain line items, so there could be offsetting entries that we are
unable to see. However, there are other quarters where the magnitude of the discrepancy
is significant and likely explanations do not appear to offset the adjustment.

For example, in the fourth quarter of 2012 AFSI reported $47.1 million more premiums
receivable in the 10-K than in the press release (excerpts below), $4.37 million fewer total
assets and $4.84 million fewer loss reserves:

Sources for the three images above: Fourth quarter 2012 Press Release and 2012 10-K


An increase in premiums receivable should be offset by either:


1. a reduction in cash if the premium was thought to be collected but actually was not,
2. an increase in unearned premiums if additional premiums correspond to future


policies, or
3. a higher reported revenue.


However, none of these were the case. We question what other offsetting entry AFSI
made and why it was not accompanied by an explanation in the 10-K or an 8-K to correct
the press release if there was an error. How does $47 million simply appear and then
disappear? AFSI management needs to explain what happened.


Interestingly, David Einhorn (Greenlight Capital) had similar questions and concerns with
Lehman Brothers' disclosures:

"As you can see, the table in the 10-Q does not match the conference call. There is
no reasonable explanation as to how the numbers could move like this between the
conference call and the 10-Q. The values should be the same. If there was an
accounting error, I don't see how Lehman avoided filing an 8-K announcing the
mistake. Notably, the 10-Q changes somehow did not affect the income statement,
as there must have been offsetting adjustments somewhere in the financials."

Executive Team's Sketchy History


Several pieces of information make it difficult to put our trust in the AFSI management
Team.


Outright Fraud- Theft and Money Laundering


AFSI CFO Ronald Pipoly & COO Michael Saxon were executive officers at Credit General
("CGI"), a P&C insurance company that was liquidated in 2001 by the Ohio insurance
regulator after it was revealed that the CEO Robert Lucia had stolen $30 million from the
company. From Court documents:


"During this same period of time, Mr. Lucia, in breach of the duties of care and
loyalty that he owed to Credit General, diverted checks belonging to Credit General
into the Outside Accounts. Although the precise amounts so diverted are presently
not known, Plaintiff reasonably estimates that the amount so diverted exceeded $30
million."


Other members of the executive suite issued false financials to hide the theft. CFO Pipoly
was Controller of CGI at the time, & COO Saxon was Chief Claims Officer. Both men were
named as defendants in lawsuits (see here and here) brought by the Ohio Director of
Insurance, alleging they were actively involved in the cover-up. Here is a quote from the
relevant court filings:

"Fazekash subsequently notified Pipoly that Lucia would be wiring a substantial
sum of money to CGIC and instructed Pipoly to account for the money as a
reduction of CGIC's commission expense. Pipoly understood that Lucia would be
wiring the money to follow through on Lucia's commitment to cease diverting
premium payments. Pipoly also understood that an accounting entry to reduce
commission expense would not be the appropriate way to account for
previously unrecorded premium payments."


In the years prior to liquidation, CGI reported incredible growth in premiums written, with a
focus on small company worker's comp (similar to AFSI). AmTrust, which entered into a
management agreement with CGI in 2000, was also sued by the Ohio Director of
Insurance.


Valuation/Conclusion:


Comparable publicly traded property & casualty insurance companies currently trade
between 1x to 1.5x tangible book value per share ("TBV"), yet at around $40 AFSI trades
at 4.7x TBV of $8.61 on a fully diluted basis. Even barring the issues we have
presented, AFSI appears massively overvalued.

The bullish investors will try to justify this premium valuation by referencing AFSI's
"impressive" reported EPS growth and a P/E that is in-line with comparables. However,
once our findings become apparent the market may place little value on AFSI's
earnings and P/E and will instead focus on TBV.


Interestingly, the next highest P/TBV multiple belonged to a very good comparable to
AFSI, TWGP, until it blew up as a result of under-reserving. It now trades at a discount to
TBV. If we were to use a 1x to 1.5x AFSI's current stated TBV, the stock would be $8.50 to
$13 per share. If we are right about the hidden losses (a $276.9 million hit) and our LSC
over valuation (a $113 million mid-point hit) conclusions, it will be worth $3.87.

Footnotes:


 In 3Q13, AFSI held 272 total policies. The Tiger Capital lawsuit claimed that AFSI held
138 policies issued by Phoenix. So Phoenix is 50.7% of the portfolio.


 Derived from 2012 Technology Insurance Company Inc.'s Schedule Y, Part 1A "Detail of
Insurance Holding Company System"


 During 2012, AII made a section 953('d') election which means that AII is now treated as
a US corporation and included in AFSI's consolidated US tax return. AFSI maintains other
non-US subsidiaries for which profits are considered to be indefinitely invested offshore.


 Note that net premium written and net earned premium very closely approximate the
results reported in the 10-K, demonstrating that there are not any material operations that
are missing other than ACHL.


 Reference: Materials For The International Solvency And Accounting Standards Working
Group, April 2013


 Our estimate is derived from AFSI's purchase price allocation disclosures. DTLs
associated with Luxembourg acquisitions totaled $206.4m and AFSI disclosed that a 30%
tax rate is applied to equalization reserves acquired ($206.4m/30%).
