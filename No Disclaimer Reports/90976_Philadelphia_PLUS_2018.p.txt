Short Idea Philosophy 


• In general, our best short ideas have been companies that rely on deceiving 
customers to make profits 


 
If deceiving clients, the company is likely deceiving investors as well 


 
If the business is ripping people off, that typically does not change when they are dealing 


with investors 





• FXCM Example: 
 


Filed a comment letter to the SEC on the retail FX industry in August 2011 
Link: https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-30-11/s73011-10.pdf 


 
Swiss Franc de-pegging led to massive client loses that pushed the company in breach of 


regulatory capital requirements in January 2015 
 


The National Futures Association (NFA) banned FXCM in February 2017 from membership 
due to “numerous deceptive and abusive execution activities that were designed to benefit 
FXCM, to the detriment of its customers”

Our Case Study 


• Our case study is a short position on Plus 500 (PLUS LN), a 
leading Contract for Difference (CFD) provider: 





1. We believe the business model strategy of deceiving low-end retail 
clients is unsustainable 
 


2. Recent regulation around lowering leverage limits could hit earnings 
per share (EPS) by 50%+ 
 


3. We believe the recent results have benefited greatly from 
cryptocurrencies, which have recently been faced with an advertising 
ban and seen lower volatility

Plus 500 Client Trades Do Not Last Very Long

PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL

• Most client trades lasts less than 1 hour 


• By comparison (Average length of time): 
• NFL football game: 3 hours, 8 minutes, 38 seconds 
• MLB baseball game: 3 hours, 5 minutes, 11 seconds 
• NBA basketball game: 2 hours, 15 minutes, and 30 seconds 





• Average client life at Plus 500 ~15 months 





• Global regulators have generally estimated 75%-85% of clients lose money on an 
annual basis 





• Percentage chance of consumer losing money for casino games over 124 
attempts by comparison: 


• Roulette (Red or Black): 72% 
• Blackjack (Basic Strategy): 58% 
• Craps (“Come Out” & “Pass Line”): 56% 


 
*assumes 124 attempts to make on comparable basis to CFD annual activity rates

Who Is Plus 500? 








12 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


• 5th largest company listed on AIM, the second tier market of the 
London Stock Exchange; Headquartered in Haifa, Israel 


“Investors (have been) warned about putting money into small companies as one in ten firms 
listed on AIM have lost 90%” - ThisisMoney.co.uk (December 23rd, 2014) 





• We believe Plus 500’s success has come from targeting an 
underserved segment of the market: the unsophisticated low-end 
not currently serviced or targeted by established firms 
 Lowest average account size at $724 per account 
 Highest client loss rate at 73% 
 Highest percentage of marketing (of total expenses) at 87% 
 Highest exposure to cryptocurrency 


 
Key Quote: 


“Unlike traditional players – who are caught between two stools trying to appeal to both professional traders and 
a retail audience – Plus500 went straight for amateur investors’ – Business Insider

Plus 500 Knowledge Test Nearly Impossible to Fail 








14 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


• Investor knowledge test during account opening is only three 
questions: 


 
 First question requires a 2nd grade level of math (i.e. 1,000 x 10 = 10,000, 


not 300 or 20,000) 


 Second question is a multiple choice question with two options asking 
about a stop loss (allowed to ask the chat helpline for assistance in 
answering) 


 Third question is a multiple choice question with two options asking if the 
applicant knew who was responsible for adding money if they are margined 
out of a position (Plus 500 or the applicant) 





Applicants are given 5 attempts to pass the knowledge test!

2009: 


• Japan (FSA) lowered leverage limits to 50:1 on FX 





2010: 


• U.S. (CFTC) reduced FX leverage to 50:1 





2011: 


• Japan (FSA) lowers leverage limits again to 25:1 on FX and 10:1 on indices 





2013: 


• Japan (FSA) introduces a new knowledge test for binary options 





2016: 


• France (AMF) has issued restrictions on electronic marketing of CFDs to retail clients 





2018 (Europe Awakens): 


• U.K. (FCA) published a Dear CEO letter detailing observations of “flawed due diligence” for new distribution relationships 


• EU (ESMA) rules will lower leverage as of June 2018 
 3-month trial, expected to be made permanent 





Global regulators are focused on customer “outcomes”.  If loss rates do not decline, we would 
expect more regulation.

Advertising Ban On Cryptocurrency 


20 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


Notable bans on cryptocurrency in 2018 
• Facebook: January 2018 


• Twitter: March 2018 


• Google: Effective June 2018 





Plus 500’s hallmark is effective online advertising (66% of 2017 
marketing spend was online) 





We estimate cryptocurrency was nearly all (90%+) of 2H17 revenue 
growth over 1H17 


• Plus 500 cryptocurrency exposure “less than 15%” of 2017 revenue  
• Assume 1H17 cryptocurrency ~5% of revenue 


• Therefore, Cryptocurrency revenue in 2H17 = ~$56M while revenue was up $60M 2H/1H 


 
20
Why Have The Stocks Not Sold Off? 


• ESMA regulation has left a carve out for “professional traders” as defined by 
the FCA 
 


• To be deemed a “professional trader” one must have two (2) of three (3) qualifications: 
1. €500k investment portfolio (including cash and financial instruments (not real estate); 
2. Work in a Financial Services role requiring knowledge of CFDs, spread betting or 


trading FX work experience of at least 1 year 
3. Traded CFDs, spread betting or FX an average of 10x in each of the last four quarters  





• However, keep in mind, Plus 500 built its business by targeting the low end of 
the market – therefore, the majority of clients will not qualify.  IG Group has 
already approved 25%+ of its business to meet the professional definition.  
Plus 500 has converted zero as it does not even have a process in place. 





Key Quotes: 


“We identified a number of firms that accepted weak answers or asked inadequate questions to assess whether a 
client could opt up to elective professional status” – January 10, 2018 FCA Letter 





“Firms should request facts and information to support their assessment of a prospective client’s expertise, 
knowledge and experience in ways that gives them reasonable assurance” – January 10, 2018 FCA Letter

Public Statements Differ Among Industry Players 








23 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


• Gain Capital (GCAP US) has noted they expect a 5% hit to 2018 full year revenue as a 
result of ESMA’s regulation 


• This is broken down as follows: 
 40% designated as professionals 


 2018 will only have about a half year impact 


 Europe is 50% of total 
 Net/Net: Assumes non-professional revenue will decline 30%-40% on a full year basis 





• IG Group (IGG LN) believes “well over” half of clients will be classified as professional, 
but did not update investors recently by quantifying the revenue impact.  Previously, 
the company noted “if ESMA proposals had been in place in the previous financial year, 
(they would expect) a reduction in revenue of less than 10%”. 


• This is broken down as follows: 
 50% designated as professionals 
 Assumes 25% decline in retail 





• CMC Markets has not quantified impact, but noted they will provide an update in June 





• Plus 500: Despite a much larger exposure to retail clients and ~3x the industry 
loss rate, Plus 500 has not commented on ESMA impact 





 
23
Plus 500 Has A History Of Ignoring Regulation 
 








24 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL

• In Early 2015, Plus 500 had to freeze accounts when the FCA 
reviewed the company’s anti-money laundering checks (or lack 
thereof) 


• Shares fell ~67% in the days after the news was revealed

Timing Could Not Be Better 








26 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


• Plus 500’s new accounts and deposits surged in 4Q chasing the 
cryptocurrency euphoria and were subsequently wiped out in 1Q 
providing Plus 500 with a record revenue quarter 





• Keep in mind, Plus 500 generates revenue as clients lose money 





• 2Q Results: We expect a return to normalized levels 





• 3Q Results: We expect the first signs of pressure from ESMA’s new 
leverage limits for retail customers 











 26
Could This Be The Next FXCM? Leverage + Regulation 








27 


PHILADELPHIA FINANCIAL  


of San Francisco, L.L.C. 


• FXCM was known as a marketing machine with more effective client 
acquisition models than peers driving the market cap of the company 
well over $1B 

















• Gain Capital purchased FXCM’s U.S. accounts at a blended rate of 
$375 per account in early 2017 
 Assuming $375 paid for each Plus 500 account results in a market cap of $119M 


(or £87) versus $2.2B (or £1.6B) currently
