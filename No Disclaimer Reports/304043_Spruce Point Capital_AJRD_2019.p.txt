Executive Summary

Spruce Point Believes Aerojet Rocketdyne
(NYSE: AJRD) Is A “Strong Sell” And Sees 40% - 60% 
Downside Risk ($13 - $20 Per Share)


In our opinion, Aerojet Rocketdyne (NYSE: AJRD) – formerly Gencorp (NYSE: GY) – is facing fundamental pressures, masked by 
complicated and aggressive accounting, which gives investors a potentially misleading impression of stability and growth. While 


holding no conference calls, and having only four analysts cover the stock, we believe the market is fundamentally ignoring ~$900M 
of liabilities associated with the business, making the Company 5x more levered than it appears and its valuation “cheap”. 


Furthermore, analysts blindly pencil in 4% revenue growth in the next two years, despite hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue 
programs that are disappearing. We see 40% - 60% downside once investors piece the puzzle together.


Aerojet’s Changing Competitive Landscape Has Revealed Complacency And Caused Fundamental Strain
 Aerojet’s primary rocket propulsion business has historically benefited from high barriers to entry, oligopolistic pricing and favorable 


cost-reimbursable contracts. In our opinion, these dynamics appear to have enabled the Company to win business and protect 
margins, despite many claims it lacks a culture of innovation 


 These dynamics have shifted in recent years with the emergence of disruptive low-cost competitors driven by lionized CEOs (Blue 
Origin / Bezos and SpaceX / Musk ), and the impact of the Northrop’s Orbital ATK acquisition on AJRD’s missile business


 We believe these shifting competitive dynamics have in-part contributed to the following revenue pressures:
• The winding down of various platforms (AJ-60 + RS-J8) and failure of AR1 to low cost competitor Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine for the 


Vulcan Rocket. We believe the loss to Blue Origin was the death blow to Aerojet by losing ULA, its only customer in space launch
 ULA, a material 17% customer, is expecting to coming under pressure: earnings are forecasted to be down 47% in 2019
 Spruce Point estimates these losses eliminate $300m of expected revenues in the near and long-term 


• Revenues from RS-25 for the SLS program (14% of 2018 revenues), are set to decline from the Sept 2018 completion of a $2.0bn 
contract, and the run-off from the 2015 $1.5bn contract to be completed by 2023
 Longer-term challenges remain with NASA’s over-budget Space Launch Systems (SLS) program dubbed the “rocket to nowhere”, 


and a recent change of tone at NASA suggest it is taking steps to find cheaper commercial alternatives to the RS-25
• In 2018, Aerojet benefitted from boosts in missile orders from key programs which are set to decline by 5% and 11% in 2019/2020,


respectively, according to the recent March 2019 DoD budget request. We estimate that Aerojet’s revenues increased $117m in 
2018 from the growth in just two key programs: Standard Missile and THAAD. These two key programs are budgeted to decline by 
2% and 35% in 2019 and 2020, respectively. 


• Declining backlog quality: largely unchanged since 2015, now becoming more unfunded and taking longer to convert to sales
 In Q2’18, AJRD’s CFO said backlog conversion to NTM sales is a critical metric. By year end 2018, it declined
6


Spruce Point Believes Aerojet Rocketdyne
(NYSE: AJRD) Is A “Strong Sell”


We Believe Aggressive Accounting And Financial Obfuscation Are Being Used To Materially Mask The Slowdown
 Headline EPS, EBITDA and Cash Flow Appear Aggressive And Overstated Considering Spruce Point’s Adjustments:


• Numerous subjective contract adjustments being used to boost results and “one-time” items not being treated as such
• We Believe EBITDAP margins are inflated by 610bps and its YoY growth is only 3.3%, not 16.1% as depicted by management
• Adjusted for a one-time contract modification benefit disclosed in Q2’18, which Aerojet later omitted from disclosing in the 


recent 10-K, we estimate operating cash flow grew 2.3%, not 18.8% as depicted by management
• Changes in working capital accounts delivered exactly $0 to total operating cash flow In 2018, supporting our view of no 


underlying organic growth
 Unbilled Receivables Exploding: Indicative of Aggressive Revenue Recognition Ahead of Billing and Collecting Cash


• Aerojet recently stopped disclosing the definition of unbilled receivables 
 New Revenue Adoption Obscuring Recent Results:


• Comparability of Revenue: Aerojet hasn’t restated 2017 results making YoY comparability difficult
• Obscures Working Capital Strain: Absent the restatement, working capital to sales has been growing materially negative each 


quarter throughout 2018
• Inventory Being Obscured: No longer provides complete inventory transparency, which is unusual for a manufacturing 


company. Inventory to backlog ratio had been shrinking prior to the change


Given the fundamental backdrop, Spruce Point is not surprised to see aggressive accounting and financial presentation 
methods being used by Aerojet that project an image of stability and growth. 


Actions By Aerojet’s Management And Pivoting To Acquisitions Validate Our Concerns About Troubles Ahead:
 Aerojet Has Had Three Recent Executive Departures From A Team of Eight Members, Including Its SVP of Space
 Aerojet Stopped Disclosing “Competitive Strengths”, “Revenue Visibility” and “Propulsion Leadership” In The Recent 10-K
 Aerojet Is Now Turning To Acquisitions For Growth, A Classic Sign That Organic Growth Is Disappearing:


• The recent March ‘19 acquisition of 3DMT (announced after market on Friday month end), appears defensive, and has 
declining sales and accelerating losses, while CEO Burke sold $1m of stock just three days before the deal was announced

Spruce Point Believes Aerojet Rocketdyne
(NYSE: AJRD) Is A “Strong Sell”


Deteriorating Incentive Structure Causing Misalignment With Shareholders: 
 Management And The Board Have Little At Risk Owning Just 3.0% Of The Company (1.9% ex: Chairman Lichtenstein’s 


Ownership)


 Years Ago, The Employee Savings Plan Was A Material Owner >10%, Now It’s Effectively 0%


 A Recent Change To The Long-Term Incentive Program For Restricted Stock Favors Share Price Growth vs. Financial Metrics


• The share price targets imply a decline in the share price growth rate and signal a bearish view
 Short-Term Incentive Bonus Definitions Becoming Much More Subjective, Conveniently Allowing The Board To Lavish 


Management With Credit For Maximum Cash Compensation


CFO Appears To Have Misrepresented His Qualifications, While A Weak Board Instills Little Confidence
 Upon Hiring, The CFO’s Bio Claimed He Was A CPA, Yet His Bio Now States He “Completed Exam Requirements”


 The Average Board Age Is 67 Years Old, But The Inclusion of General Merrill McPeak At 82 Has Us Concerned:


• General McPeak was the Lead Director at Miller Energy Resources (NYSE: MILL), a bona-fide accounting fraud that went 
to zero. The SEC charged management with securities violations and even fined the auditor


• McPeak recently notified Aerojet he intends to retire and not stand for re-election 
 Spruce Point was the first to identify the accounting problems at Miller as a short idea in 2011 on Sumzero.com


 Recent Resignation of Audit Chair James Perry In Late Dec ‘18 Is Concerning:


• Perry was CFO and Treasurer of United Industrial Corp during a period the SEC blasted it for fraud concerning foreign 
corruption and stated the Company  “lacked meaningful controls to prevent illicit payments”


• Perry’s Replacement, New Audit Chair James Henderson, Was Recently Chairman of the Board and Audit Committee 
Member At School Specialty, Inc. (OTCBB: SCOO)


 Recently in March 2018, SCOO received an “Adverse Opinion” of its financial controls during the period of 
Henderson’s tenure, and before the share price collapsed >60%
8


Spruce Point Believes Aerojet Rocketdyne
(NYSE: AJRD) Is A “Strong Sell”


Potential Stock Sales A Near-Term Catalyst: 6 Million+ Reasons Not To Own Aerojet While Selling Pressure Overhangs


 2.7 million Shares Contributed To A Trust For The Benefit of Employees Can Be Sold In The Very Short Term


• Short-term window to sell shares post the Sept 2018 trust grant sends a very negative signal
• The trust is not registered with the SEC, and does not have to report its stock sales


 Based On Recent Share Price Performance, AJRD’s 2.25% Notes Are Currently Convertible At The Option of Holders


• Assuming Conversion, We Estimate 4.0 million Shares Would Come To Market 


Expensive Valuation And Highly Levered While The Market Ignores ~$900m of Liabilities And Disappearing Revenue Programs


 Analysts And Market Data Services Completely Ignore Material Liabilities Associated With AJRD (Many Off Balance Sheet)


• On Balance Sheet:  Legacy environmental reserves estimated at $328 - $472m and unfunded pension obligations of $394m
• Off Balance Sheet: Operating leases, Huntsville capex commitments, post medical retirement costs
• Unquantifiable Tail Risks:  DOJ civil investigation, two recently disclosed tax audits: IRS and California (previous material tax 


accounting weaknesses have been noted by Aerojet)


 AJRD Rated B+/Ba3 by S&P/Moodys: On the surface Net Debt / 19E EBITDA is -0.3x, but with our adjustments, it is closer to 5.1x


 Analysts Are Currently Split on AJRD (2 Buys / 2 Holds) With An Average Price Target of $41, Implying 20% Upside


• Some analysts argue AJRD is cheap by taking its results at face value, and comparing it with other over-valued midcap A&D 
companies that Spruce Point has previously researched, including Aerovironment, Kratos, and Mercury Systems


• AJRD is valued at 1.3x, 10x, and 24x FY19E Sales, EBITDAP and EPS – but the market is expecting 4% sales growth and 
missing key revenue programs that are winding down. We see a 5% revenue decline more likely 


• By applying a discounted multiple range to our adjusted enterprise value and financial results, we derive a price target of 
$13.00 - $20.00 (40% – 60% downside) including entitled land value


 Follow the money: Many long-term owners are consistently selling stock and reducing ownership. Aside from passive investor 
Vanguard, Aerojet has attracted only one new fundamental investor of size in recent years

AJRD’s Share Price Appreciation Merits 
Significant Scrutiny


Spruce Point has identified many red flags as it relates to Aerojet’s meteoric share price appreciation since 2017. Its significant 
EBITDAP growth without corresponding cash flow growth should be evaluated relative to recent executive and director 


departures, along with heavy insider selling, a civil DOJ inquiry, and disclosure of federal and state tax audits.

Capital Structure And Valuation


Aerojet is significantly more levered and valued than appears on its surface. We believe the market is ignoring significant 
environmental and post-retirement benefit costs. In addition, there are tail risks such as DOJ civil fines and tax payments from


audits currently being conducted by the Federal and State tax authorities.  Once it becomes clear that Aerojet’s decision to start 
acquisitions is a strategy to cover revenues that will organically decline, we believe investors and creditors will pay closer 


attention to its true leverage, which we believe is closer to 5x on a Net Debt to EBITDA basis.

Warning: AJRD Removes Key 
“Competitive Strength” Statements


In its recently filed 2018 10-K, Aerojet removed the three key “competitive strengths” touted since 2012.

Competitive Pressures Intensifying


Aerojet has long warned of increasing competition from SpaceX and Blue Origin, but a recent win by Blue Origin 
makes the realization of this risk more tangible. Based on our conversation with industry experts, the loss to Blue 


Origin was the “death blow” to Aerojet and will impair its relationship with ULA – a material customer.


Source: Space News, Oct 5, 2018


Blue Origin’s anticlimactic victory and Aerojet’s Plan B


“ULA couched the selection of BE-4 as one part of a larger industry team that will build the BE-4. Northrop Grumman will 
provide the solid-fuel boosters, L-3 Avionics the avionics and Ruag the payload fairing for Vulcan.

Florida. Credit: NASA NASA astronauts get acquainted with an RL10 engine during a tour of Aerojet Rocketdyne’s facility 
in West Palm Beach, Florida. Credit: NASA


Also a part of that industry team is Aerojet Rocketdyne, who announced an agreement with ULA in May to produce 
versions of the RL10 engine for the upper stage of Vulcan. Aerojet, though, was also competing to provide Vulcan’s main 
propulsion with its AR1 engine under development.


But AR1 was long considered the underdog, in part because the engine was well behind the BE-4 in development. “I have 
confidence they can get their engine to work,” Bruno said of Aerojet April, while noting that the engine was as much as 
two years behind the BE-4. 


Aerojet also appeared to recognize in recent months that its engine was a long shot. In February, both the company and 
the U.S. Air Force acknowledged that they were renegotiating the terms of an agreement, formally known as an Other 
Transaction Authority (OTA), to support development of the AR1. Neither organization, though, would discuss what was 
changing in the agreement.


“For example, we face increasing competition from entrepreneurs such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, who 
have been or are in the process of developing liquid fuel propulsion capabilities which are primarily focused 
on the development of space propulsion systems for heavy lift launch vehicles. These new entrepreneurs 
have signaled their intent to compete primarily on price and are therefore bringing pressure to bear on 
existing cost paradigms and our manufacturing methodologies”

ULA: A Material Aerojet Customer 
Under Pressure


ULA is a material customer to Aerojet, accounting for 17% of revenues in 2018. Based on recent commentary from 
Lockheed Martin (LMT),ULA’s earnings are expected to decline by 47% in 2019.


LMT Q3’18 Conf Call: “We also expect to have lower equity earnings associated with the ULA business as a result of the number and mix of
launches expected in 2019 compared with 2018”…. “The largest single item that is driving the margin reduction next year, though, is actually our ULA equity 
earnings. Those are actually going – we expect those to be down nearly $150 million or so from this year's estimate of the equity earnings from ULA. And you 
should think of that as a pretty significant reduction in both the launch quantity, in terms of the number of vehicles launched, but probably more importantly, a

Industry Consolidation An Overhang On 
AJRD’s Rocket Business


According to Space News, the Northrop Grumman / Orbital ATK deal will put Aerojet at a competitive disadvantage for 
competing on cost for large solid rockets. The sole rationale for keeping Aerojet in the business could be to prevent a 


monopoly, despite its challenges to compete on price. 


Source: Space News, June 27, 2018


In the wake of Northrop-Orbital merger, Aerojet’s solid rocket engine business teetering on the brink


“There are now technically two companies that still manufacture large solid rockets for military ICBMs — Aerojet 
Rocketdyne and Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, which absorbed Orbital ATK in a deal that closed June 
6. The industry is poised to become a monopoly, however, as Aerojet’s large solid rocket motor business is on not-
so-solid ground”


“While both companies have healthy production lines for solid rockets for tactical missiles, unless Aerojet gets new 
orders, Northrop could end up as the Pentagon’s sole supplier of large solid rocket motors — generally defined as 
those greater than 1 meter in diameter.”


“Aerojet’s bottom line is that it needs 30 percent of the GBSD work to remain a viable supplier. The entire program 
will require 650 first-stage engines alone. Each missile will have three stages. “GBSD will drive demand for SRMs 
for at least the next dozen years,” Thompson said. “If Aerojet has no role, it is out of the business.”


“By any measure, Northrop Grumman will have an overwhelming advantage. It now operates Orbital ATK’s four 
facilities: two in Utah that make large SRMs, one in West Virginia that produces tactical rocket motors, and one in 
Maryland that specializes in solid rockets for anti-missile interceptors.”


“The situation got more complicated when Northrop Grumman last fall announced its intent to acquire Orbital ATK. 
Aerojet officials became alarmed by the prospect of one of the GBSD prime contractors also being the nation’s 
dominant supplier of large solid rocket motors, therefore having no incentive to compete the work.”

FTC Settlement of Northrop’s ATK Orbital 
Acquisition Was Intended To Promote Missile 
Competition Amongst Primes  


In June of 2018, the FTC reviewed and later settled violations of the Clayton and Federal Trade Commission Act with 
Northrop Grumman over its acquisition of Orbital ATK.  The focus of the review was to ensure fair competition 


amongst Primes supplying the U.S. government with missile systems.  A key element of the settlement requires that 
Northrop must make its solid rocket motors and related services available on a non-discretionary basis to all 


competitors of missile contracts.   


Source: FTC, June 29, 2018


The products at issue: Northrop is one of four companies capable of supplying the U.S. government with missile systems, including tactical missiles,
strategic missiles and missile defense interceptors according to the complaint. Orbital ATK is the premier supplier of SRMs, which propel missiles to their 
intended targets and are an essential input for missile systems.


What this means for consumers: The FTC’s complaint alleges that Northrop’s proposed acquisition of Orbital ATK would have reduced competition in 
the market for missile systems purchased by the U.S. government, resulting in less innovation and higher prices for taxpayers. By ensuring that other 
missile suppliers can continue to compete, the settlement preserves the procompetitive benefits of the transaction while addressing the potential 
anticompetitive harms.


The competition concerns and economic implications: According to the complaint, the acquisition would provide Northrop with the incentive and 
ability to harm competition for missile contracts by either withholding access to its solid rocket motors or increasing SRM prices to competitors. As a 
result, competitors would be forced to raise the prices of their missile systems, invest less aggressively to win missile programs, or decide not to compete 
at all, which, in turn, would decrease competitive pressure on Northrop. The FTC alleged that the acquisition would have violated federal law by reducing 
competition in the market for these missile systems.


The complaint also alleges that Northrop’s acquisition of Orbital ATK’s SRM business would give Northrop access to the proprietary information that 
missile contract competitors share with their SRM vendor. In addition, the acquisition creates a risk that the proprietary, competitively sensitive 
information of a rival SRM supplier supporting Northrop’s missile system business could be shared with Northrop’s vertically integrated SRM business.


The settlement preserving competition:
• Northrop must make its solid rocket motors and related services available on a non-discriminatory basis to all competitors for missile contracts
• Northrop must establish firewalls to keep it from transferring or using any proprietary information that it receives from competing missile prime 


contractors or SRM suppliers in a manner that harms competition
• The DOD’s Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment will appoint a compliance officer to oversee Northrop’s compliance with the 


order.

FTC Settlement Unintentionally Cripples 
AJRD’s Competitive Positioning?


Although the FTC’s settlement may prove an effective means of promoting competition amongst Primes for missile 
systems, according to AJRD’s Public Comment Letter it was critical that the order be modified (which it appears not to 


have been) to avoid the unintended consequence of NGIS becoming the sole regulated SRM.


Source: AJRD Public Comment Letter, June 29, 2018


“In accomplishing its intended purpose, the Order in effect encourages all prime contractors to simply choose SRMs from Northrop’s new Orbital 
subsidiary (which Northrop has named Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems “NGIS”) and not conduct a competitive bidding process.”


“Other prime contractors, who will all be bidding on programs that include SRMs as one input, will view the non-discriminatory requirements of the Order as 
requiring NGIS to provide SRMs at the vertically-integrated prices that Northrop will receive. With a low-cost offer mandated by the Order that is on par with 
Northrop’s SRM cost in its bid, the prime contractors have no incentive to consider SRM providers other than NGIS when creating their bids. The Order in 
effect requires Northrop’s vertically-integrated SRM provider (NGIS) to provide its low-cost vertically integrated priced SRMs to all other prime 
contractors. Knowing that NGIS will provide a strong SRM package to its parent Northrop, other prime contractors will demand that NGIS provide the same 
terms for SRMs as it gives to itself. Consequently, the Federal Trade Commission has effectively removed any incentive for the other primes to seek bids 
from Aerojet Rocketdyne, the only other provider of SRMs. Although this result may protect prime contractors that, because of the acquisition, feared losing 
immediate access to NGIS’s SRMs, as an unintended consequence the Order will end the competition from Aerojet Rocketdyne that will lead to lower prices 
and innovation in the future. This is of particular concern as the Department of Defense conducts generational competitions to recapitalize our Nation’s 
strategic defense TRIAD such as the Air Force’s Ground Based Strategic Deterrent (“GBSD”) program and the Navy’s Trident II D-5 submarine launched 
Fleet ballistic missile follow-on program.”


“Aerojet Rocketdyne’s concern is NOT that prices will be too low or that Aerojet Rocketdyne will not be able to provide a competitive offering. The 
concern is that there will be no more competition due to a regulated SRM offering that NGIS will be required to provide to every prime under the current 
language of the Order. Thus, competition between Aerojet Rocketdyne and NGIS will be eliminated by the requirements of the Order.”


“NGIS, already dominant in large SRMs, will now grow increasingly dominant in all SRMs because of the anti-competitive SRM regime put in place by
the Order.  This lack of competition will reduce innovation and raise prices on all SRMs, even those unrelated to the GBSD and Trident II D-5 follow-on 
programs, as the effects on a subset of SRMs have collateral effects on all SRMs. For example, the cost of acquiring the materials necessary in creating any
SRM will be affected by changes to the competitive dynamics in only one type of SRM.”


“Aerojet Rocketdyne, which has successfully competed in the SRM market for decades, welcomes the opportunity to compete in the future, and through 
competition will continue to bring innovative, cost effective solutions to our Nation’s warfighters and NASA. However, it is critical that the Order be modified 
so that it does not create an SRM regime that eliminates competition in the SRM market. The Order should be modified to foster a competitive SRM 
market and clarify to all industry participants that the Order has not ended all competition in the SRM market.”

Space Business Has Even Stronger 
Headwinds For AJRD’s Sales Outlook


As much as tightening defense budgets may drag on AJRD defense sales, the outlook for the Company’s space 
business is even weaker. Until several years ago, competition in the space engine industry was relatively stable, and 
former employees report that management rested on its laurels with little concern for potential competitive threats. 


Credible competitors and aggressive upstarts have since established a foothold in the industry, and have taken 
hundreds of millions of dollars of AJRD’s business. A number of AJRD’s rockets could soon be completely orphaned 


after missing out on contracts for major launch vehicles.

2019/20 Defense Budget Will Create A 
Big Headwind For AJRD’s Top Programs


In 2018, Aerojet benefitted from boosts in missile orders which will not be repeated in the 2019 budget. Based on the 
2020E overall budget, key programs are expected to fall by 11% driven by declines in THAAD and PAC-3 / MSE  . We 


estimate that Aerojet’s revenues increased $117m in 2018 from the growth in Standard Missile and THAAD.

SLS At Best Capped, At Worst Significant 
Downside Risk


Space Launch Systems (“SLS”) is a material program to Aerojet, at $265m or 14% of sales. It provides the RS-25 engine. 
The SLS program has been marked by repeated delays and budgetary over-runs. A recent change in tone from NASA 


suggesting “private commercial rocket” solutions are necessary, creates a negative overhang for Aerojet. 


Source: NASA 2020 Summary Budget


“During 2018, we continued to make progress in moving toward first 
launch of NASA’s Space Launch System ("SLS"). An inventory of 16 
flight-ready RS-25 main engines are nearly complete and include 
newly upgraded flight controller to support the first four flights of the 
heavy-lift rocket. In parallel, we are modernizing our RS-25 components 
and preparing for production of the next generation of RS-25 engines.”

RS-25 Revenues Will Decline


The initial $2.0 billion contract for 16 RS-25 engines was completed in Sept 2018, while a second contract for six engines 
at a total cost of $1.5 billion continues through 2024. 


This invariably suggests that RS-25 revenues are set to decline from 2019 going forward. 


Furthermore, in the latest of a series of Request For Information (RFI) filings, NASA has called for alternative options to 
the RS-25 engine that will power the core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS). The RFI appears to be aimed at 
engines to be used after the RS-25Ds left over from the Space Shuttle era – and some already purchased RS-25Es –


have been used up. (1)

Stagnant And Deteriorating Backlog


Aerojet’s backlog is essentially unchanged at $4.1 billion since 2015. However, the % of funded backlog has decreased, 
making it lower quality in our view. At year end, the backlog expected to be realized in the next 12 months fell to a year 


end low of 45%. We believe these factors add further uncertainty to Aerojet’s outlook.

Déjà vu: When Business Is About To 
Deteriorate, Start Talking Up More M&A


Given our belief that Aerojet business will come under pressure, we find that it recently started talking up acquisitions or buying 
new product lines and increased its credit facility from $750M to $1.0BN. We suspect this refinancing was done opportunistically by 


management before its financial condition deteriorates. Spruce Point has successfully pinpointed other businesses that have 
pivoted towards acquisitions ahead of financial collapse. Déjà vu: XPO, a successful short we believed was looking for acquisitions 
to cover growing financial and business strains, refinanced its credit facility ahead of problems surfacing. In addition, MacDonald 
Detwiller acquired DigitalGlobe and rebranded itself Maxar Technologies, which foreshadowed its ultimate share price collapse.

In Our View, AJRD Has Limited Acquisition 
Options And Already Doing Weak Deals


Given Aerojet’s concentration in its current market segments, we do not believe it has any material acquisition opportunities that could 
transform and accelerate sales and earnings growth. Not surprisingly, its recent acquisition of 3DMT was small and announced Friday at 
4pm EST after market close, perhaps in a away to avoid investor scrutiny. Aerojet purposefully described the deal as “immaterial” and 


would not disclose financial details. It even omitted that the acquisition was made from a tiny bulletin-board-listed public company called 
Arc Group Worldwide (ARCW), bolstering our view that it may not want investor scrutiny over the deal. We retrieved public documents 


that show 3DMT had been for sale for since July 2018, was experiencing declining revenues, and increased operating losses.

Red Flags With Inventory Disclosure


Aerojet describes itself as a manufacturer, yet Spruce Point is at a loss to explain why it cannot clearly break out 
inventories (raw materials, WIP and finished goods) like a traditional manufacturer? In 2018, its new revenue 


recognition adoption allowed it to reclassify Inventory to Contract Assets, where it now obscures the balance. 
We observe that inventory to backlog fell to a multi-year low in 2017 prior to the reclassification. This calls into 


question the quality of the backlog and why Aerojet isn’t building inventory to deliver on projects?

Company Description Per 10-K: “Aerojet Rocketdyne is a world-recognized technology-based engineering and 
manufacturing company that develops and produces specialized propulsion systems, as well as armament systems. 
We develop and manufacture all four propulsion types (liquid, solid, air-breathing, and electric) for space, defense, civil 
and commercial applications”.

Working Capital Trends Deteriorating 
Pre-Revenue Recognition Change


Below is what Aerojet’s balance sheet would look like without the effect of the recent adoption. What’s clear is that its working 
capital trends are progressively deteriorating. Thus, in addition to the income statement benefit from the accounting change, 


Aerojet also conveniently appears to be masking balance sheet deterioration.

And As Expected Anemic Cash Flow Growth, 
That Wasn’t “Very Very Strong”….


On the surface, it appears that Aerojet increased cash from operations by nearly 19% in FY 2018. However, it received a one-time
boost from a contract modification with the Air Force that was disclosed in the 10-Q. Suspiciously, Aerojet omitted this same 
disclosure from its annual report – perhaps because it didn’t want to draw scrutiny to its low quality total annual cash flow. 


At the very least, the AR1 cash flow will not be sustaining or continuing in nature.

Spruce Point Adj. EBITDAP vs. AJRD’s


We gain little comfort from AJRD’s previous material weaknesses in accounting, and its rosy portrayal of Adj. EBITDAP margin 
expansion and growth. We find numerous discretionary factors and levers management has used to enhance reported results. 


Importantly, AJRD has not restated results to account for the ASC 606 revenue adoption, making FY 2017/2018 YoY comparisons 
difficult.  We believe its EBITDAP margins are inflated by 610bps, and YoY growth is just 3.3%, not 16.1% depicted by management. 
By making our adjustments, it becomes clearer that EBITAP growth (3.3%) approximates Operating Cash growth (2.3%) (see prior slide)

Growing Signs of Tax Troubles


Management identified prior material weaknesses in its tax function, but in its recent Annual Report stopped 
disclosing any weaknesses. Yet, it is now disclosing two tax audits at the federal and state level. 


Period Company Disclosures Pertaining To FY 2018


Q2 2018
“In the three months ended June 30, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service notified the Company that its federal 


income tax return for the fiscal year ended November 30, 2015, was selected for audit. The Company is unable 
to determine the outcome of the audit at this time.”


Q4 2018
“In the fourth quarter of 2018, the California Franchise Tax Board notified the Company that its California tax 


returns for the years ended November 30, 2014, and November 30, 2015, were selected for audit. The 
Company is unable to determine the outcome of the audit at this time”


Source: 2017 10-K, p. 99


“Until the identified material weakness is eliminated, there is a risk of a material adverse effect on our financial results.”

Has The CFO Misrepresented Himself?


A typo, error, or misrepresentation of his qualifications? We observe that the AJRD’s CFO was represented as a CPA 
upon his appointment to the role in 2016. However, the Company has changed his bio to say he “successfully completed 


the CPA exam requirements”. What’s clear from his record is that his CPA expired in 2009, or more than 10 years ago.

Director Concerns


In our opinion, Aerojet’s Board is weak and cannot be relied upon to accurately detect financial and accounting problems. 
For example, Director Gen. McPeak was a Lead Director at Miller Energy (NYSE: MILL), a major accounting fraud that was foreseen by 
Spruce Point, delisted and went to zero. Various other Directors have been involved with companies undergoing regulatory scrutiny.

Red Flags From Management’s 
Short-Term Compensation


Management has historically been compensated on higher EBITDAP figures than reported to investors, and the proxy 
statement doesn’t provide detailed calculations allowing investors to reconcile the difference. Furthermore, its other 


two compensation metrics, bookings and corporate and operating cash flow, are defined in non-standard ways.


Why Is Management Compensated on Higher EBITDAP Than Reported To Investors?


Management 
Performance 
Targets (proxy)(1)


“Fiscal 2017 performance targets consisted of adjusted EBITDAP, Corporate operating cash flow, Aerojet 
Rocketdyne bookings, and certain other individual goals and had a 12-month performance period.”

1)  The EBITDAP is defined consistently across AJRD’s filings, but Bookings and Corporate Cash Flow From Operations are not
• We defined Aerojet Rocketdyne Bookings to be the amount of money to be received for a contract of our Aerospace and Defense segment for which 


funding is authorized and has been directly appropriated and contractually obligated by the customer.
• We defined Corporate Cash Flow from Operations to be the Company’s cash provided by operating activities net of cash used in financing activities, 


exclusive of debt issuance costs, repayments on debt and proceeds from the issuance of debt.
• We defined Adjusted EBITDAP to be earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization and retirement benefit expense adjusted for unusual items.

Adjusted EBITDA Becoming More 
“Adjusted” For Management Comp Plan


If you look carefully at the recent proxy statement filed March 2019, management hit all its short-term incentive targets, 
but it appears a loosely defined Adj. EBITDAP, which now nets recoverable costs from US gov’t contracts and includes 
unspecified “Board approved modifications”, is the driver. Furthermore, personal factors which account for 20% of the 


bonus are no longer tied to achieving “all three financial metrics at the threshold”, but rather are based “upon the 
assessment of performance related to Company goals and objectives, and individual and leadership competencies”.

6.7 Million Reasons To Sell:
Catalysts Overhanging AJRD Share Price


We believe there are two factors that may overhang Aerojet’s stock in the near term: 1) 2.7 million shares to be sold for the
benefit of employees ‘anticipated’ to be sold in the short-term, and 2) 4.0 million shares currently convertible at the option of 


note holders given that the stock has exceeded 130% of its conversion price. (1)  We believe that the ability of the trust to
sell stock in a short time frame after being contributed is a red flag, particularly in context of Aerojet’s audit chair resigning, 


its COO entering into a retention agreement, and IRS and California tax audits being disclosed shortly thereafter. (2,3,4) 
The trust is not registered with the SEC and can sell stock in a non-transparent manner.

The Market Incorrectly Values Aerojet By 
Ignoring Key Liabilities


Source:  SunTrust, Feb 2019


Spruce Point believes that the market is fundamentally miscalculating the enterprise value of Aerojet by ignoring the deep in-the-
money convert value, along with significant liabilities overhanging the business (tax, environmental, unfunded pension).

In October 2017, the Company entered into an agreement to lease a new 136,000-square-

thirty-one years and is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2019 resulting in an 
estimated remaining financial commitment as of December 31, 2018, of $32.2 million
representing a present value of $21.0 million. The liability has not been recorded as of

Tax Liabilities 


AJRD has acknowledged material tax weaknesses in the past.
Q2 2018 it identified an IRS audit for 2015. Q4 2018 the California Franchise Tax Board notified 


the Company that its California tax returns for the years ended November 30, 2014, and 
November 30, 2015, were selected for audit. 


“The Company is unable to determine the 
outcome of the audit at this time”


Dept. of Justice 
Civil Investigation


In Q1’17, AJRD responded to a DoJ civil investigative demand requesting info relating to 
allegations under the false claims Act


“The Company has not recorded any 
liability for this matter as 
of December 31, 2018”


Total Estimated Liabilities: $822.6 – $966.8


We estimate $822 - $966 million of additional liabilities (beyond the convertible bond notional) are not being factored into 
Aerojet’s valuation, allowing some analysts to claim it is “cheap” on the surface. 


However, these are real fixed financial costs that cannot be ignored.

Current investors are paying a premium to the Company’s historical valuation. In addition, we believe the 
fundamental valuation of Aerojet is substantially higher than it appears given numerous off-balance sheet 


liabilities being ignored by the market and diminishing revenue programs.

Aerojet Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


On face value, Aerojet’s revenue and earnings growth are comparable with industry peers. This forms the basis that its 
valuation is also in-line or at a discount with peers. However, Spruce Point believes that Aerojet’s enterprise value 


does not accurately reflect numerous liabilities, its financial results are inflated with aggressive accounting, and that 
its projected financial results will materially disappoint the Street “consensus” view formed by just a few analysts.

Whereas Creative Analysts Claim AJRD 
Trades At A Discount….


In our opinion, analysts incorrectly believe Aerojet is cheap by comparing it with overvalued “small cap” A&D peers, 
none of which even compete within its rocket propulsion or missile defense market segments. In addition, Spruce 


Point has raised concerns about the earnings quality for each of these overvalued companies, and the fact that hype 
around “drones” is inflating the current values of Kratos and Aerovironment.

AJRD’s current multiple is 1.3x but that rests on 
the assumption that its revenues will grow 4%. We 


believe that assumption is incorrect, and that 
revenues are poised to decline by 5%. As a result, 


a discounted multiple is justified. 
We also factor in the entitled land value based on 


AJRD’s most recent transaction value.

Valuing AJRD on EBITDAP is inherently more 
difficult given the numerous accounting 


distortions we illustrated earlier. We do not 
believe that its 16% EBITDA margins are near 


best-of-breed in the A&D sector, but closer to 10% 
once adjusted for one-off items and factors at the 


discretion of management. 


$ in millions, except per share amounts


Given our concerns about the reliability of Aerojet’s Adjusted EBITDAP, we believe the most conservative way to value the 
Company is on its revenues, which we can estimate with insights from the defense budget and current rocket programs.


1. In 2015, AJRD sold 700 acres of land for $57m ($46.7m in cash / $10m in promissory notes). The Company currently has 3,904 acres entitled. Entitled land is generally used to 
denote the required set of regulatory approvals required to allow land to be zoned for new requested uses


2. Includes the following adjustments
a) Env’t liabilities at the midpoint of estimate:  $400.0m
b) Unfunded pension: $393.9m

Some bulls see significant value in Aerojet’s ability to unlock value with its land, though much of it is environmentally 
challenged from contaminated soil and groundwater and is a Superfund site designation by the EPA. (1)  Despite years of 
promises, the Company has only been able to sell its Hillsborough project of 700 acres in 2015. We only give the Company 


credit for entitled land. Meanwhile, the range of environmental liabilities associated with the properties continues to rise 
over time, and environmental expenditures continue to consume on average $37m per year.
