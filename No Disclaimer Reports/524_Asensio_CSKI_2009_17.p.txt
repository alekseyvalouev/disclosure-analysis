More on China Sky’s ‘Brotherly’ Suppliers from
Motley Fool


Posted on July 24, 2009 by Asensio.com


On July 22nd, asensio.com released a report on China Sky One


Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) concerning what may be an


undisclosed related party relationship between CSKI and an


unnamed supplier run by the brother of China Sky’s CEO. Click here


to view the report.


The asensio.com report was based on statements made on a post on


the Motley Fool website. The post stated: “The excuse for lean


inventory (and not one that wholly provides peace of mind) is the


company gets its raw materials from a company run by the CEOs


brother. Thus, they get all sorts of related party benefits (so it goes


in China).”


The post was not written simply by a blogger, as we initially


thought, but by a Co-advisor for Motley Fool’s Global Gains, a stock


research service. Motley Fool Global Gains staff visited a number of


companies in China, including CSKI, and provided reports to their


subscribers, along with the postings available to the public.


Yesterday Motley Fool posted a new comment about its previous


CSKI post and also made available to the public notes on the


meeting with CSKI management.


In the update on the original post (click here to view), the writer


states, ‘I’ve been contacted by the company’s [CSKI’s] IR firm and


said we interpreted the quote wrong vis a vis the relationship


between CSKI and one of its suppliers. In fact the companies are


“close as brothers,” but not necessarily blood related.’


Whether a supplier is a brother of the CEO, or “close as a brother,”


the remark by China Sky management and the follow-up from


China Sky’s IR firm are both highly irregular, and raise questions

about this supplier relationship. It appears the IR firm likewise did


not divulge the name of the brotherly supplier.


Motley Fool provided notes on the CSKI meeting, which included a


Q&A with questions about asensio.com’s critiques. The Motley Fool


staff’s notes paraphrase responses from CSKI management. The


notes state, “In some sense U.S. investors are naive when it comes


to China. They have a hard time understanding that a supplier


might be willing to make an arrangement where most of the


inventory we need is held on their books until the last minute when


we actually need it.” Click here to view Motley Fool’s notes on the


CSKI meeting.


The remark from CSKI management, echoing one made during the


first quarter conference call, is insufficient to explain the inventory


irregularity, and points to the crux of the inventory’s importance.


Even if China Sky is somehow able to get its brotherly suppliers to


hold inventory until “the last minute” when China Sky’s customers


need finished product, there is still the issue of storing the finished


product inventory until it reaches retail locations, or until it is


shipped to distributors.


If China Sky somehow also has a brotherly relationship with


distributors, where all inventory is held for it off-its-books, China


Sky must provide some incentive to these parties. China Sky does


not describe any such incentives in its SEC filings.


A note on the last asensio.com report: Motley Fool Global Gains


maintains that it provides independent research and that it has no


position in China Sky, unlike the anonymous Seeking Alpha blogger


cited in the last report who disclosed a long position in CSKI.
