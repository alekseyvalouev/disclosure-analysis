“I think more people are seeing people walk around with 


Herbalife on their chest, and approaching them. And 


people are now asking us, and that is what I talked about 


the paradigm shift, what is Herbalife? And that is a new 


paradigm for our distributors, where someone walks up 


to them and says, you know, what is Herbalife? Who are 


you? We have become in a way a cool company like 


almost over night, which is very gratifying and 


confidence-building for our distributors. 





When they see that name Herbalife everywhere all the 


time, they get excited about that, and they get less – 


what should I say – less cautious about saying who we 


are, what we are.”

Develop and Market a Nitric Oxide Product

“In December 2000, we expanded our cardiovascular focus when we acquired the 


assets and certain liabilities of Cooke Pharma, Inc., the exclusive maker of the 


HeartBar® line of arginine-enriched products, which operated as Unither 


Pharma, Inc. (Unither Pharma), our wholly-owned subsidiary. Arginine is required by 


the body to produce nitric oxide. Unither Pharma is the exclusive licensee of patents 


entitling it to claim that arginine is critical for maintaining vascular function and 


certain other natural functions.”

What is a Pyramid Scheme?

What is a Pyramid Scheme? 


In 2002, Dr. Peter J. Vander Nat, a senior economist 


at the FTC, defined a pyramid scheme: 


60
Herbalife Is Well Aware of the Law 


61
Why are Pyramid Schemes Illegal? 


________________________________________________ 


Source: Webster v. Omnitrition, 79 F.3d 776, 781 (9th Cic. 1996). 


In a pyramid scheme, the money at the top is made from 


the losses of people at the bottom of the pyramid 


62
63 


In the next section, we will 


demonstrate two facts: 


1. Participants in the Herbalife scheme, the distributors, 


“obtain their monetary benefits primarily from 


recruitment rather than the sale of goods and services 


to consumers.” 


2. Herbalife inflates the Suggested Retail Price (“SRP”) of 


its products and overstates “Retail Sales” in its public 


filings to conceal the fact that Recruiting Rewards 


earned by distributors are substantially greater than the 


Retail Profit they generate
64 


And we will demonstrate that: 


Herbalife is a Pyramid Scheme
65
How does Herbalife‟s business 


work? 


66
Herbalife Is a Direct Seller: 


Its Products Are Not Sold in Retail Stores

Customers 


Distributors purchase products 


from Herbalife at wholesale 


Distributors resell products to 


customers at a markup or use

Distributors purchase products from Herbalife at what HLF deems to 


be “wholesale” prices and consume the products themselves 


(“Internal Consumption”) or resell them at retail prices thereby 


capturing the markup (“Retail Profit”) 


(1) 


________________________________________________ 


(1) Herbalife products are retailed in stores in China due to the country‟s MLM laws. 
(2) Herbalife‟s Sales & Marketing Plan defines Customers as “anyone who is not an 


Herbalife Distributor who purchases Herbalife products at retail price.” We apply the 
same definition to “Retail Customers.”

How To Become An Herbalife Distributor 


 Distributors must buy their way in  


 All independent Herbalife distributors  


must purchase an International  


Business Pack (“IBP”) to enroll  


 Cost: $55 to $91 
 


 Distributors must sign a Distributor Agreement 


 Herbalife‟s Distributor Agreement has 124 pages, 48,000 words 


and 215 rules 


 Herbalife‟s non-compete restricts senior distributors from soliciting 


alternative multi-level marketing opportunities (e.g., senior 


distributors can work part-time at GNC but not Avon)

How Distributors Move Up the Chain: Volume Points 


Picture Source: Herbalife Independent Distributor Presentation. 


In order to advance in the Marketing Plan, distributors must accumulate 


Volume Points (“VPs”), a form of “currency” created by Herbalife 


Distributors cannot 


advance past this 


line w/o recruiting 


■ One VP is approximately equivalent to $1 of “Retail Sales” 


■ Over time this ratio has increased to greater than 1:1, which is a 


way for Herbalife to “increase price” to its distributors 


■ Distributors accumulate Volume Points by purchasing 


product or by recruiting others who purchase product 


■ To get to the upper levels of the Herbalife chain, 


distributors must accumulate a special kind of volume 


known as Royalty Override Points (“ROPs”) 


■ Royalty Override Points can be generated only when a 


Sales Leader recruits other distributors who also become 


Sales Leaders 


■ It is impossible for a distributor to get to Active World 


Team or above without recruiting other Sales Leaders – no 


matter how much they sell at retail

Senior Distributors Encourage Other Distributors to 


Recruit if they Want to Make “Lifestyle Money” 


________________________________________________ 


Source: Herbalife independent distributor audiovisual presentation (11-28-11). Online Business Systems is an Herbalife affiliate overseen by Shawn Dahl (Chairman‟s Club). 


“If you want some money today, perfect, put together a retail plan. But if you want lifestyle 


money, if you want to build that financial independence, you want to lock in that security for 


life, you need to recruit. And the other thing you need to do to, be prepared to roll that cash 


flow for straight 9 to 12 months. Because you know what, in that short space of time, by 


making that commitment, you are going to create a foundation for life. Absolutely. Not just for 


yourself, but a legacy, a legacy for your family, for your children, and their children‟s children.”

Herbalife‟s Compensation Plan: 


Two Ways to Earn, Six Different Names 





 Distributors may earn profits by purchasing the company‟s products at wholesale  


 prices (which are discounted 25% to 50% from SRP depending on the distributor‟s  


 level within the company‟s distributor network) and selling the products to Retail Customers 


  
 Distributors receive commissions when other distributors in their Non-Sales Leader   


 organizations purchase product directly from the Company at lower discounts (25%/35%/42%) 


 Distributors who sponsor other distributors and establish their own Sales Leader    
 organizations (“downlines”) may earn royalties of up to 15% (three active levels,  


 up to 5% each) on the SRP of product purchased by their downline 


 Senior Sales Leaders may earn Production Bonuses of up to 7% (“infintely deep” in the chain)  
 on the SRP of product purchased by their downline 


 A discretionary bonus paid to the most senior Sales Leaders in the aggregate  
 amount of 1% of Retail Sales 


 Sales Leaders are eligible to qualify for promotions including vacations and other perqs

available to Herbalife distributors is by way of example (next page)

________________________________________________ 


Source: Herbalife Investor Day (2009). 


“There are two ways to make profit as a distributor 


within Herbalife. It‟s the retail component, right? So 


you distribute it, buy the discount and that represents 


about two-thirds of the profit opportunity. And then 


there is a royalty component and that royalty 


component allows a distributor to earn on other 


distributors they bring into the business.”

Adjustment #1: 


Suggested Retail Price ≠ 


Actual Retail Price
 In order for distributors to sell Herbalife products and receive 


their full markup (“Retail Profit”), they must pass through 


surcharges and other expenses to Retail Customers 


 All Herbalife distributors must pay a 7% packaging and 


handling charge (“Surcharge”) on the Suggested Retail Price 


for products ordered directly from the Company 


 The Surcharge was instituted in the early 1990s at 5% as a way for 


the Company to fund the roll out of the Production Bonus. Over 


time, it has increased to 7% 


 Until 2001, Herbalife accounted for the revenue from the 


Surcharge as an offset to royalty override expenses

 This charge is in addition to the ~4% expense distributors must 


pay (of SRP) to have the product shipped if they do not pick up 


the product from one of the limited number of Herbalife‟s 


distribution centers

quantity of product ordered and whether or not distributors

Actual Retail Price Summary 


 Because of the Surcharge and other fees, distributors must resell 


products at a substantial premium to SRP in order to capture 


Herbalife‟s promised 25% to 50% Retail Profit 


 Suggested Retail Price is an artificial, inflated number with no 


relation to the price at which Herbalife‟s products are actually 


sold to Retail Customers 


 Independent distributor websites sell Herbalife products  


for a ~40% discount to Adjusted SRP 


 eBay data suggest Herbalife‟s most popular products sell for a  


34% to 48% discount to Adjusted SRP 


 For the purpose of our analysis, we conservatively assume 


Herbalife products are sold for a 35% discount to Adjusted SRP

Herbalife products at a minimum discount of 25 percent.

Why would anyone pay $55 to get  


a 25% discount when Herbalife 


products are widely available 


online for discounts of more than 


35%? 


120
Herbalife Would Like Others to Believe that its 


“Discount Buyer” Distributors are Like Costco Members 


“Often people ask well, what does a distributor look like? 


How do they behave? Last year, when distributors 


ordered from the Company, 51% of the time, their 


average order was $100, and they received about a 


25% discount. So most of the distributors tend to be 


discount buyers, similar to joining Costco or some club 


like that, where you pay $49, and you get a 25% 


discount at Herbalife – just like you would buying a club 


card at Costco and enjoying the discount on the 


product.”

Herbalife Admits that Internal Consumption is 


“Substantial” 


Though Herbalife admits Internal Consumption is substantial 


for any MLM, it notes that it has put in place rules to limit it 


“The percentage of product of any multi-level marketing 


company consumed by its distributors is substantial. This is not 


surprising since consumers who are enthusiastic about the 


products become distributors in order to purchase at a discount 


and possibly to share and sell the products to others. In 


addition, in order to minimize the risk of product being 


accumulated by distributors, the company has policies in place 


such as the 70% Rule, the Ten Customer Rule and the Buy 


Back policy.”

These Rules Do Not Limit Internal Consumption 


 Not all distributors have to comply with these rules. 


Only Sales Leaders, those entitled to Royalty 


Overrides, are required to sign certifications 


demonstrating compliance (~19% of total distributors) 
 


 Sales Leaders do not receive their paychecks from 


Herbalife unless they sign a certification 


demonstrating compliance with these rules 
 


 The 70% volume requirement can include sales to 


one‟s downline. By definition, this does nothing to limit 


Internal Consumption

Herbalife‟s Lax Enforcement of Its Rules 


 Between 2006 and 2009, Herbalife possibly disciplined 


about 10, but fewer than 25, distributors for violating the 


70% Rule (fewer than 1 out of every 100,000 distributors) 


Deposition of Jacqueline Miller in Herbalife v. Ford (2009): 


Mr. Stephens: (Ford Counsel) 


“Have more than 50 distributors since January of 2006 been disciplined for 


violating the 70-percent rule?” 
 


Ms. Miller: (Herbalife Employee) 


“I don‟t believe so.” 
 


Mr. Stephens: 


“Have more than 25 distributors been disciplined for violating that rule?” 
 


Ms. Miller: 


“I don‟t believe so.” 
 


Mr. Stephens: 


“Have more than 10 distributors been disciplined for violating the 70-percent rule?” 
 


Ms. Miller: 


“That‟s possible.” 
127
Herbalife‟s Lax Enforcement of Its Rules (cont‟d) 


 Herbalife appears to audit compliance only when 


distributors seek to return product to the company 














 Distributors seeking to return product to the Company who cannot demonstrate 


compliance with the rules will have their previous rewards payments netted against 


their product return. In many cases, this “clawback” is greater than the returned 


value of the products 





Deposition of Jacqueline Miller in Herbalife v. Ford (2009): 


Mr. Stephens: (Ford Counsel) 


“How did you know about the 1200 [audits performed for the ten customer rule]?” 
 


Ms. Miller: (Herbalife Employee) 


“I asked.” 
 


Mr. Stephens: 


“Who did you ask?” 
 


Ms. Miller: 


“Julie Delaney… She works for Jenny [Heinrich]… She‟s director or senior 


director. She‟s been in the refunds and repurchase area, and I think she might 


have responsibility for the audits.” 


128
Internal Consumption Summary 


 Herbalife does not track the amount of product that is sold 


outside the network, though it could if it wanted to 


 Contrary to Herbalife‟s belief that a large part of its “customer” 


base is comprised of distributors who sign up to receive a 


discount on product purchases, we believe the vast majority of 


“discount buyers” are nothing more than failed distributors 


 Herbalife has put rules in place to limit Internal Consumption, but 


these rules are ineffective and enforcement is lax 


 A “substantial” amount of the product purchased from Herbalife 


is never sold at retail. For the purpose of our analysis, we 


conservatively assume that means 30%, though the true amount 


of Internal Consumption could be meaningfully higher

Other MLMs account for Wholesale Commissions as

“Revenue Recognition  


The Company receives payment by credit card, personal check, or 


guaranteed funds for orders from independent distributors and makes related 


commission payments in the following month. Net sales reflect product sales 


less the distributor discount of 20 percent to 40 percent of the suggested retail 


price. Sales revenue and commission expenses are recorded when the 


merchandise is shipped, as this is the point title and risk of loss pass. In 


accordance with EITF 01-09, the Company presents distributor royalty and 


commission expense as an operating expense, rather than a reduction to net 


sales, as these payments are not made to the purchasing distributor.” 





             – Reliv International, Inc. Annual Report (2007) 





Wholesale Commissions ≠ Retail Profit (cont‟d) 


137
Wholesale Commissions are a Form of Recruiting Profit 


 Retail Profit is profit on sales to Retail Customers, not other distributors. 


This interpretation is both intuitive and supported by the case law 


 Wholesale Commissions are substantively no different from royalty 


overrides. They are a form of Recruiting Rewards paid based upon the 


SRP of product purchased (not sold) by downline distributors 


 Other MLMs account for Wholesale Commissions as operating expenses 


 We question how many of Herbalife‟s distributors are “discount buyers” 


 The vast majority of Herbalife‟s “discount buyers” are failed distributors 


 A Belgian court, which found Herbalife to be operating a  pyramid scheme, 


dismissed the notion that distributors can be classified as customers

approximately 54% of SG&A was “Distributor Facing” expenses

143
“Distributor Facing” Expenses are Incentives 


Similar to Royalty Overrides 


From the Investor Day Transcript (12-16-08): 


“Of our net sales, we believe that 73% of our business or our cost structure is highly 


variable. Our royalties that we pay distributors, about 36% of sales. Our product 


costs, 21%, and distributor facing spending, which is sort of sacrosanct. This is what 


Des mentioned earlier, and Michael. This is the last area that we want to touch as it 


relates to trying to leverage our margins. 





In fact, if anything, what we try to do is over-invest in this area because we do 


believe that complementing our royalty expense with very prudent incentives and 


promotion can actually drive incremental ROI on the spending. So, when we look at 


our essentially fixed overhead, and fixed is relative depending on what time horizon, 


we look at 12% of our cost structure being essentially fixed.” 





                – Rich Goudis, CFO, Herbalife 


144
A Substantial Portion of Distributor Facing 


Expenses are Effectively Recruiting Rewards 


Though Herbalife‟s SG&A disclosure is limited, we estimate a mean-


ingful portion of Distributor Facing expenses are dedicated to vacation 


packages, one-time cash bonuses, Herbalife pins and watches, and 


other similar promotions that can only be gained via recruiting

Herbalife‟s Compensation Plan Incentivizes 


Distributors to Recruit Aggressively 


 Distributors cannot get to the higher-income, upper levels of the 


Herbalife chain without recruiting 


 To get to Active World Team, GET Team, Millionaire Team, President‟s Team, 


or Chairman‟s Club, a distributor must accumulate Royalty Override Points, 


which requires having (recruiting) downline Sales Leaders 


 Herbalife‟s most lucrative rewards (Royalty Overrides, Production 


Bonuses, and the Mark Hughes Bonus) are only available to distributors 


who have reached the rank of Sales Leader and have recruited Sales 


Leaders beneath them 


 As Sales Leaders recruit, and as they incentivize their recruits to recruit,  


they become eligible to receive additional recruiting rewards, and their 


commissions grow geometrically 


 Production Bonuses go “infinitely deep” into the distributor‟s downline 


 Wholesale Commissions are only available to distributors who have 


recruited Non-Sales Leaders 


152
A Distributor‟s Ability to Earn Retail Profit via 


Herbalife‟s Business Opportunity is De Minimis 


 We estimate that the typical Herbalife distributor earns less than $10 


per month in Retail Profit 


 Even using Herbalife‟s reported “Retail Sales,” the typical distributor only 


earns $87 per month 


 Furthermore, these figures are gross, not net of distributor expenses, which 


we believe to be material 


 The “wholesale” price paid by distributors for Herbalife products 


does not allow for meaningful Retail Profits. As a result, a 


distributor‟s only real chance to earn the money promised in 


Herbalife distributor presentations is by recruiting 


 No distributor can achieve “financial freedom,” “generate perpetual income,” 


or earn enough to buy a Ferrari by simply retailing 


153
Herbalife‟s inflated Suggested Retail 


Prices for its products mask the fact 


that the Recruiting Rewards earned by 


distributors vastly exceed their Retail 


Profits

What other factors might the FTC 


consider in determining whether a 


company is a pyramid scheme? 


157
An Alternative Way to Approach the Question 


In 2004, the FTC issued a Staff Advisory Opinion 


stating the following: 


Simply stated: 


Why do participants buy the product? 


158 


The critical question for the FTC is whether the revenues that 


primarily support the commissions paid to all participants are 


generated from purchases of goods and services that are not simply 


incidental to the purchase of the right to participate in a money-


making venture.
Why Do Senior Distributors Buy Product? 


To “Pay-for-your-Paycheck” 


In 2009, Bruce Roth (former President‟s Team member) provided the following 


declaration as part of a legal dispute against Herbalife that alleged that 


Herbalife was illegally perpetuating a pyramid scheme

loss of Powell‟s Organization Volume, the monthly volume of 


Anthony Powell was made available as part of discovery

Team member to support 5,000 VPs, why did it suddenly 


disappear when he reached Millionaire Team?

not permitted;” yet, Powell purchases just enough Personal

Why Do Distributors Buy Herbalife Product?  


 Senior distributors purchase product to “pay-for-their-


paycheck” 


 Mid-level distributors purchase product to re-qualify and 


maintain their downline “lineage” 


 Junior distributors purchase product to participate and 


advance in the business opportunity 


 Herbalife‟s compensation plan incentivizes orders 


without regard to retail demand

Herbalife‟s Disclosure of Distributor Earnings 


The table in Herbalife‟s disclosure of distributor earnings only includes “Active” 


Sales Leaders. Inactive Sales Leaders and Non-Sales Leaders are excluded

base earning $0 in “Gross Compensation” (Inactive Sales 


Leaders and Non-Sales Leaders) 


________________________________________________ 


(1) Per the Company‟s disclosure, Inactive Sales Leaders must not be earning any Royalty Overrides [(39.4%)*($7,348) = $2,900; which implies Inactive Supervisors “Gross Compensation” must be $0].

Deception #2: 


“Gross” “Earnings” 


Herbalife‟s Statement of “Gross” Compensation refers to 


“Average Earnings,” but it is not adjusted for distributor expenses 


182
“Gross” “Earnings” (Cont‟d) 


After David Einhorn questioned the company on a conference 


call, Herbalife revised its disclosure to explain that “Earnings” 


are before expenses. For at least 10 years, Herbalife had not 


disclosed this fact to its U.S. distributors

Failing to Disclose Expenses 


This itemized list of Business Support Materials below comes from the 


blog of a former Herbalife Non-Sales Leader distributor showing nearly 


$2,000 of expenses in only three months, excluding Herbalife product 


purchases. The Company seldom acknowledges these costs exist

In Jacobs v Herbalife, a class action lawsuit of 8,800 distributors against 


the company, average Sales Leader expenses were ~$10,000

totaled $27,345,366 and averaged $10,124 per claimant. The highest totaled $128,241. 184
Deception #3: 


Cherry-Picking “Active” Leaders 


Herbalife uses multiple definitions of the term “Active.” In its 


public filings, it broadly defines “Active” Sales Leaders. In its 


distributor earnings disclosure, it uses a more narrow definition 


% Active              52.4% 


Herbalife cherry-picks the highest earning “Active” Supervisors for 


its distributor earnings disclosure

              for the year ended 12/31/11 in its 2011 10-K. 


185
Deception #4: 


“Over 25% of Distributors reach Supervisor” 


Herbalife states that “over 25% of Distributors reach the rank 


of Supervisor and above,” implying a new distributor has a 


one-in-four chance of being in one of the table‟s earnings 


brackets (so long as they are “Active”) 


186
“Over 25% of Distributors reach Supervisor” (cont‟d) 


Herbalife has made this statement in each of its U.S. distributor

Summary: Everything Is Not Really Easy   


Source: Herbalife Independent Distributor Presentation (2011) 


 There is nothing easy about achieving the wealth and lifestyle new distributors are led to 


believe are possible 


 Herbalife is effectively a closed system at the very top. The probability of making it to 


Millionaire Team, which would allow a new distributor to earn an amount commensurate 


with Herbalife‟s testimonial earnings claims (~$178k), is approximately one in five-thousand 
________________________________________________ 


(1) We analyzed 393 testimonials and earnings claims from editions of Herbalife Today magazines from 1997 – 2004. The average earnings per year from the claims implied an annual income of 
$178,000 per year. To earn this amount per year, a new distributor would need to reach Millionaire Team (average income per year: ~$100,000 in 2011). In 2008, there were ~3x more Millionaire 
Team members than President‟s Team members. Millionaire Team members also have a 99% retention rate, which implies roughly 3 times as many Millionaire Team members were created as 
President‟s Team members from 2004 through 2009, putting the odds at 1 out of every 3,400 new distributors achieved Millionaire Team. 
1 in 5,000 is used because to earn $178,000 per year, a distributor would either need to be a “senior Millionaire Team member” or a “junior President‟s Team member.”

Section 5 of the FTC Act provides: “unfair or deceptive acts or 


practices in or  affecting commerce, are hereby declared 


unlawful.”  15 U.S.C. § 45 


 A general, flexible provision that is designed to protect consumers from unfair, 


misleading or abusive practices 


 An objective standard: Are the acts or practices at issue likely to mislead 


consumers acting reasonably under the circumstances?    


 No requirement to show that consumers were actually confused or misled or that 


they actually relied upon the challenged acts or practices 


 Enforcement is by the Federal Trade Commission 


 Remedies can include injunctive and monetary relief, restitution, and 


disgorgement.  Aims for both remedies and prevention.

 State & Non-U.S. Laws  


 States have their own consumer-protection statutes, some known as „Little FTC 


Acts‟ that track federal standards, and some providing private rights to sue 


  Many States have specific laws against pyramid schemes 


 Non-U.S. jurisdictions have consumer protection regimes that regulate pyramid 


schemes.  Some bar MLMs 


States and non-U.S. jurisdictions regulate consumer protection 


and multi-level marketing

What are “Unfair or Deceptive Practices”? 


The Policy Statement on Deception specifically mentions “failure to 


disclose information regarding pyramid sales” as a situation in 


which the FTC has found deception    


202 


See FTC Policy Statement on Deception (Oct.14, 1983), appended to Cliffdale Associates, Inc., 103 F.T.C. 110, 174 (1984); F.T.C. v. Five-Star Auto 


Club, Inc., 97 F. Supp. 502, 526 (S.D.N.Y. 2000).   


1. A representation, omission or practice 


2. Likely to mislead reasonable consumers under the 


circumstances 


3. And that is material, meaning likely to affect a 


consumer‟s choice or conduct with respect to the goods 


or services 


In a key 1983 Policy Statement on Deception, the FTC explained that 


deceptive acts or practices involve three elements:
203 


Herbalife Acknowledges its Regulatory Risks… 


From Herbalife‟s 10K – Risk Factors: 


Our network marketing program could be found to be not in compliance with current or 


newly adopted laws or regulations in one or more markets, which could prevent us from 


conducting our business in these markets and harm our financial condition and operating 


results.   


. . .  


We are subject to the risk that, in one or more markets, our network marketing program could be 


found not to be in compliance with applicable law or regulations. Regulations applicable to network 


marketing organizations generally are directed at preventing fraudulent or deceptive schemes, often 


referred to as “pyramid” or “chain sales” schemes, by ensuring that product sales ultimately are 


made to consumers and that advancement within an organization is based on sales of the 


organization‟s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales-related 


criteria. The regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include “bright 


line” rules and are inherently fact-based and, thus, we are subject to the risk that these laws or 


regulations or the enforcement or interpretation of these laws and regulations by governmental 


agencies or courts can change. The failure of our network marketing program to comply with 


current or newly adopted regulations could negatively impact our business in a particular market or 


in general.
…And Tries to Mitigate Those Risks 


“We put together a political action committee inside our 


company.  I am in Washington every quarter, if not more 


than that.  I have a list of Senators and Congressman that I

Here are some tips that consumers and business might find helpful. 


1. Beware of any plan that makes exaggerated earnings claims, 


especially when there seems to be no real under-lying product sales or 


investment profits.  The plan could be a Ponzi scheme where money 


from later recruits pays off earlier ones.  Eventually this program will 


collapse, causing substantial injury to most participants.

“Multi-level distribution companies shall not represent, directly or indirectly, that 


participants in a multi-level marketing program will earn or receive any stated gross 


or net amount, or represent in any manner, the past earnings of participants . . .

Summary on FTC website: 


http://business.ftc.gov/documents/bus71-ftcs-revised-

Testimonials, Earnings Claims & Disclaimers 


The FTC has approved revisions to its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, 


or Guides, which became effective on December 1, 2009. Although the Guides are not binding, they explain how the 


FTC interprets Section 5 of the FTC Act‟s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Consequently, the FTC 


could bring a Section 5 enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the Guides. Under the 


revised Guides, advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her atypical experience with a product or 


service are required to clearly disclose the results that consumers can generally expect. In contrast to the 1980 


version of the Guides, which allowed advertisers to describe atypical results in a testimonial as long as they included 


a disclaimer such as “results not typical”, the revised Guides no longer contain such a safe harbor. The revised 


Guides also add new examples to illustrate the long-standing principle that “material connections” between 


advertisers and endorsers (such as payments or free products), connections that consumers might not expect, must 


be disclosed. Herbalife has adapted its practices and rules regarding the practices of its independent distributors to 


comply with the revised Guides. However, it is possible that our use, and that of our independent distributors, 


of testimonials in the advertising and promotion of our products, including but not limited to our weight 


management products and of our income opportunity[,] will be significantly impacted and therefore might 


negatively impact our sales.  


221 


Herbalife acknowledges that, under the 2009 FTC Guides, its and its 


distributors‟ use of income opportunity testimonials may be “significantly 


impacted and therefore might negatively impact our sales.”   


From Herbalife‟s 2009-2011 10Ks (emphasis added):
3.   If a plan purports to sell a product or service, check to see whether 


its price is inflated, whether new members must buy costly inventory, 


or whether members make most “sales” to other members rather than 


the general public.  If any of these conditions exist, the purported 


“sale” of the product or service may just mask a pyramid scheme that 


promotes an endless chain of recruiting and inventory loading.

Indicia of Pyramids: A History of Lawsuits  


The FTC recommends considering whether the MLM has a 


history of lawsuits that allege deceptive practices? 


Source: FTC publication “Bottom Line about Multilevel Marketing Plans” (Oct. 2009).
228 


A History of Lawsuits  


Herbalife has been in approximately 270 lawsuits around the world.  Many 


involve run-of-the-mill commercial disputes, but a significant number go to the 


heart of Herbalife‟s business and practices 


●  Test-Aankoop v. Herbalife Int‟l Belgium.   After seven years of proceedings, in 2011, a Belgian judge in 


the Commercial Court in Brussels (capital of the EU) determined Herbalife was operating a pyramid scheme.  


The case is on appeal.  


● Herbalife v. Ford.  In federal court in California, Herbalife sued former distributors for joining another MLM, 


alleging a violation of Herbalife‟s non-competition rule (no. 8A in the Sales and Marketing Plan).  The 


distributors invoked California‟s Endless Chain Scheme statute.  In a key pre-trial ruling, the Court found 


Herbalife‟s compensation system to be facially unrelated to sales of products to end users.  Before trial, the 


case was disposed of on other grounds. 


● Minton v. Herbalife.  In 2009, in a California state court proceeding, Herbalife was sued by a group of 


former distributors that claimed Herbalife‟s Sales and Marketing Plan constituted an endless chain scheme. 


● Jacobs v. Herbalife.  In 2004, Herbalife settled a lawsuit brought on behalf of a class of 8,700 former and 


current Herbalife distributors, accusing the company of running a pyramid, securities-law violations and other 


deceptive practices, including its “Newest Way to Wealth” promotion.  HLF discontinued this promotion and 


defendants entered into a settlement totaling $6 million.
229 


● Her Majesty the Queen v. Global Online Systems, Inc..  In 2004, a Canadian Competition Bureau 


investigation revealed that Global Online Systems Inc., a recruiting front led by senior Herbalife distributors, 


was operating a pyramid selling scheme.  Following indictment and conviction, the Federal Court entered a 


Prohibition Order against Global Online Systems, Inc. and its principals Deborah Stoltz and Marilyn Thom. 


● Mey v. Herbalife.  In 2003, consumers filed a class action in West Virginia, alleging that Herbalife and its 


distributors were violating the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 by the use of “Herbatel” phone 


service and the Herbal Dialer Lead Generation System to auto-dial tens of thousands of consumers.   


Herbalife discontinued the practice, and defendants settled for $7 million. A similar case was filed 10/2012.   


● Ralo v. Zehavi. In 2003, an Israeli judge, deciding a dispute between distributors, noted that Herbalife‟s 


“method of marketing reminds [me] of the „pyramid‟ marketing method.”  The Court cited FTC warnings 


about what to watch for in assessing potential pyramids.   


● People of the State of California v. Herbalife International, Inc.  In 1986, Herbalife consented to the 


entry of a Final Judgment and Permanent Injunction, under which the company promised to desist from 


certain product claims and to pay $850,000 to settle allegations by the Attorney General of the State of 


California that it operated as an “endless chain” and made deceptive medicinal claims. The Final Judgment 


included provisions regulating the compensation structure of Herbalife‟s marketing program and the 


medicinal claims made by Herbalife.

Additional Significant Herbalife Cases

A History of Lawsuits: the Ford case 


Memorandum & Order Regarding Cross-Motions for Summary Judgment, No. CV 07-02529, slip op. at 16 (C.D. Cal. Aug. 25, 2009) (quoting Webster 
v. Omnitrition, 79 F.3d 776, 782 (9th Cir. 1996)).  The Ninth Circuit in Omnitrition said that compensation unrelated to ultimate-user sales is the 
“sine qua non” of a pyramid scheme.  79 F.3d at 781 (emphasis added).  The marketing system in Omnitrition (found prima facie to be a pyramid) is 
nearly identical to Herbalife‟s plan.  While the Ford case was disposed of on other grounds – namely, the parties challenging Herbalife as a pyramid 
failed to show that they were victims of the scheme, as opposed to participants who profited from it – the Court‟s finding was not disturbed or changed. 


In 2009, the California federal court stated that Herbalife appears to pay 


compensation facially unrelated to sale of products to ultimate users – an 


essential element of finding of an MLM to be a pyramid. 


In Herbalife v. Ford, a group of senior Herbalife distributors, including a former President‟s Team 
member (top 0.1%) – network insiders who knew how the system works – accused HLF of operating 
an illegal pyramid scheme.  In 2009, after extensive factual discovery, the Federal Court in California, 
Herbalife‟s headquarters, applied the Ninth Circuit‟s Omnitrition decision to Herbalife and stated: 


“Herbalife‟s entire business model appears to incentivize primarily the 


payment of compensation that is „facially unrelated to the sale of the product 


to the ultimate users because it is paid based on the suggested retail price of 


the amount ordered from [HLF], rather than based on actual sales to 


consumers.‟”    - District Judge Gary A. Feess

Indicia: Targeting People Vulnerable to the „Dream‟ 


In Koscot, 86 F.T.C. at 1145, the FTC found (¶  100) (emphasis added): 


Pyramids target people with little or no business experience, those most 


vulnerable to high-pressure offers of an „opportunity,‟ but who may not see the 


risks and costs – and people of similar profiles

the opportunity for them to have that access to the

Indicia of Pyramids: Complex Compensation Rules 


In F.T.C. v. BurnLounge, No. 2:07-cv-03654, slip op. at 9 (C.D. Cal. July 1, 2011) 


(footnotes omitted), the Court found it difficult to provide an accurate delineation 


of the compensation plan . . .  


Often, an MLM‟s compensation system is complex, with many layers of periodic 


purchase and sales requirements, subject to numerous qualifications and 


cross-referenced standards.   


given the degree of complexity in its composition and the failure of its creators to value 


intelligibility, consistency, and useful definitions.  Indeed, it would appear that 


BurnLounge was attempting to create a labyrinth of obfuscation rather than a readily 


understood compensation system.

“Pop-and-Drop”

recruiting is the initial phase of our business and then 


retailing comes in to function at the base of it. We try to 


train distributors and we‟re taking a much more 


aggressive stance… 
 


China is 1.3 billion people, you can recruit for a long time 


there before we had what was called the classic „pop-

persons who become members wishing to focus on good 


nutrition and regular exercise in order to achieve optimum 


health.”

“So metrics that are indicative of consumption, our visibility is always a question 


in direct selling…And some of the stats on this page were introduced in the last 6 


months as just evidence of the type of visibility that we have. 
 


So the first row looks at the core 3 products of the foundation of Nutrition 


Clubs…In 2002, those 3 products represented 35% of our volume. And last year 


and through this year, third quarter, it represents more than half our volume. 


Why? Because that shows - because the expansion of daily consumption is 


driving our growth. In daily consumption, those 3 products are the products that 


are sold in Clubs…And therefore, that growth is indicative of consumption 


growth. That growth in those 3 core products.”

club tours together. I think it's important for 


somebody interested in this model to go see a club. 


And you'll understand that within clubs, it is all 


consumption based.”

Our Research Revealed a Different Experience 


You might notice several things about the Nutrition Clubs we 


observed: 


 No exterior signage 


 No mention of Herbalife or its logo on the Club exterior 


 Windows are covered so you cannot see inside  


 No advertising or promotion  


 No depiction of product  


 No indication when the Club is open or closed 


 Product is poorly prepared and presented
285 


Herbalife Imposes Many Constraints on its Club 


Operators‟ Ability to Retail Product 


If residential, no exterior signage of any kind 








 
If non-residential, may have a sign IF… 


 
 …it does not imply a store, restaurant, or retail 


    location and doesn‟t invite product purchase 
 





 …it does not imply any relationship to Herbalife 
 











 …it does not promote shakes or products 








 …it does not state if the Club is open / closed

As the CFO Explains… 





“So the clubs first and foremost can't be retail 


establishments. They can't be Herbalife signed stores. 


Okay?…The consumer cannot know it is a club until they 


have come inside. 





They can't know it has anything to do with Herbalife. So 


the windows are blocked, or – you can have no reference 


where somebody walking by will know it is Herbalife.”                       





   - John DeSimone, CFO, Nov. 16, 2011 





Query: 


If the goal is consumption, why does Herbalife make it virtually 


impossible to generate sales?

The Company‟s Depiction of Nutrition Clubs Does Not 


Adhere to its Own Nutrition Club Rules 


Rule 5-C: 
Must ensure 


the interior of 


the Club is not 


visible, by use 


of window 


coverings 


Rule 1-N: 
Always use 


disposable 


cups to serve

 Despite the operating constraints placed on its Nutrition Clubs, 


Herbalife says their competition is McDonald‟s 











 Note, however, that Herbalife makes no mention of fast food 


competitors in its SEC filings 


 “Our competitors include both direct selling companies such as 


 NuSkin Enterprises, Nature‟s Sunshine, Alticor/Amway, 


 Melaleuca, Avon Products, Oriflame, Tupperware and Mary Kay, 


 as well as retail establishments such as Weight Watchers, Jenny 


 Craig, General Nutrition Centers, Wal-Mart and retail pharmacies.”
     - Herbalife, 2011 10-K 


Herbalife Claims its Competition is Fast Food 


290 


“You're not going to like my answer on competition 


because strategically we view the competition as fast 


food…It is the steal a meal a day from fast food. It is not to 


go after other supplement companies. It's to go after 


McDonald's, to go after KFC.”                       


        - John DeSimone, CFO, Sept. 7, 2011
 No signage, including external displays of the Company‟s name or logo 


 No advertising or promotion 


 Must cover windows 


 Must serve exact same three liquid products to every customer for 


breakfast, lunch, and dinner 


 No “Open / Closed” sign

Why Are Herbalife‟s Shipping & Handling Costs So Low?

Product Buyback
Herbalife‟s Primary Evidence that Retail Activity Exists is 


the Fact that Product Returns are Low (0.4% of Retail Sales) 


- Charles Patterson, Herbalife Attorney 


________________________________________________ 


(1)  Returns were 0.4% of Retail Sales in 2011. Source: Herbalife Investor Presentation (May 2012).

(1) 


(2) 


308
Herbalife‟s „buyback‟ policy is 


effective at limiting product 


returns. Therefore, we believe the 


0.4% return percentage is not a 


useful indicator of Retail Sales 


309
 A meaningful amount of product is purchased by Non-Sales Leaders 
from Sales Leaders in the “field,” not directly from the Company, 
and is not eligible to be returned to Herbalife 


 Herbalife‟s buyback policy permits the company to deduct recruiting 
rewards earned on returned product retroactively (“clawback”) 


 This clawback gives Sales Leaders an incentive to discourage their downline 
from returning product to Herbalife 


 In many cases, Sales Leaders are better off repurchasing product from their 
downline rather than allowing them to return it to Herbalife 


 Herbalife‟s buyback policy is not a 100% cash back guarantee 


 A non-refundable Surcharge and a 10% restocking fee mean that Sales 
Leaders only get 79% of their money back on returned product 


 To return product to the Company, distributors are required to 
resign, forfeiting their hard-earned downline forever 


Herbalife‟s 0.4% Return Percentage Does Not 


Necessarily Indicate Retail Activity 


(1) 


________________________________________________ 


(1) Products are only eligible for return to the company “if the products were purchased from Herbalife.” (Source: Herbalife Sales & Marketing Plan); “Purchases directly from the company – of that 82%, a lot of people never 
purchase from the company. So they sign up to be a distributor from their sponsor, but they still buy product from the sponsor… Again, a million of our distributors don‟t order directly from the company.” (Source: John 
DeSimone, CFO, Herbalife at the Citi Global Consumer Conference (5-23-12)). 


(2) E.g., a Sales Leader who pays $50 plus a $7 Surcharge for $100 of SRP product is entitled to get back $45 ($57-$7-10%*$50). In mid-2012, after David Einhorn questioned the Company, Herbalife eliminated the restocking fee.

310
 Distributors are encouraged to sell to friends and family 


 Herbalife encourages new distributors to sell product to friends and family who 
may be reluctant to return product even if they are not using it 


 Distributors are encouraged to “Use, Wear, Talk” 


 Herbalife pushes new distributors to create their own personal testimonial by 
using their newly purchased Herbalife products. Only unopened product can be 
returned 


 Trend toward smaller order sizes reduces likelihood of returns 


 Distributors who buy in smaller quantities are less likely to go through the 
enormous effort required to return product. They are also more likely to sample 
and use a higher percentage of the product they purchase, thereby making it 
ineligible for return 


 Returns are reported as a percent of Retail Sales not Product Sales 


 Herbalife‟s return percentage would be twice as high if the company reported 
returns as a percent of GAAP Product Sales 


Herbalife‟s 0.4% Return Percentage Does Not 


Necessarily Indicate Retail Activity (Cont‟d) 


311
 To return product, distributors are required to produce 
lengthy sales documentation, in part to verify the 70% Rule 
and Ten Customer Rule certifications 


























 Limited distributor sophistication and the financial incentive to falsify 
certifications make it likely that many distributors lack the proper 
records to return product 


Equinox, which 


was found to be 


a pyramid 


scheme, had a 


similar policy:

Distributor Frustration 


Distributors find Herbalife‟s Inventory Repurchase conditions so 


restrictive that they don‟t even bother to return product:

Deposition of Bruce Roth (Former Distributor): 


313
And In Some Countries, Herbalife Does Not Even 


Have a Return Policy…  


314
Existence Of a Buyback Policy Is Not a Safe Harbor 


Amway‟s buyback policy was an important consideration in the court‟s decision 


that Amway was not a pyramid scheme; however, courts have later clarified that 


the policy must be effective and enforced to be a relevant defense 


Webster v. Omnitrition, 79 F.3d 776, 784 (9th Cir. 1999). 


315
Compared to Amway, HLF‟s Buyback Policy Does Not 


Adequately Protect Distributors From Losses 


(1) Herbalife‟s restocking fee is 10%; Amway‟s was 5% 


(2) HLF‟s buyback policy has a 12-Month Expiration; Amway had none  


A court found that a 10% 


restocking fee is a large 


enough to burden 


distributors with a

How Many Sales Leaders Have Failed? 


 Sales Leaders join Herbalife to participate in the business 


opportunity, not to consume the product 





 Since 1980, we estimate that ~1.9mm Sales Leaders (ex-China) have 


failed in the business opportunity¹  


 The Company provides detailed Sales Leader statistics between 


2004 and 2012;  


 Using this data, we estimate that in the 2006-2012 period ~1.1mm 


Sale Leaders failed² and left the business, a ~90% failure rate³ 


________________________________________________ 


(1) Uses the Company‟s data  to determine how many Sales Leaders “failed” between 2006 and 2012 (using churn as a proxy for failure). Using 1980-2012 Retail Sales as a proxy, we extrapolated our 2006-2012 churned 
Sales Leaders to approximate the number of Sales Leaders who have failed since 1980. 


(2) Total Sales Leaders Demoted and Resigned in Jan. and Feb. between 2006 and 2012 was 1.07mm per HLF 10Ks filed during the period. In addition, by comparing full year Sales Leader additions with the beginning and 
ending Sales Leader totals, we estimate that an additional 42k distributors left between March and December in the 2006 – 2012 period (2012 was estimated using prior year trends).   


(3) Failure rate = (Total Failed Sales Leaders Feb. 2006 – Feb. 2012)/(New Sales Leaders Mar. 2004 – Feb. 2011).
