Questionable Business Strategy: In our opinion, Tower is a collection of old semi foundries cobbled together from acquisitions, 
which produce significantly below industry average GAAP gross margins (from 2012-2014 Tower 9% vs. 23% peer average). Having 
gone through numerous financial restructurings in the past, Tower promotes large revenue goals reaching $1bn, and a large Non-
GAAP EPS headline of questionable merit, but has amassed ($695m) of negative cumulative free cash flow since 2004! Not having
the capital support or free cash flows to fund the large capex requirements to compete in the semiconductor manufacturing 
industry, Tower spends just 15% of sales on capex vs. peers at 40% of sales. Its recent deals (e.g. Micron and Panasonic) reflect a 
short-term business strategy designed to bolster revenue growth for short periods, which allow its partners to sunset aged 
product cycles. It also allows Tower to book abnormal bargain purchase gains and trumpet the potential for new revenue sources 
from selling unused fab capacity. However, Tower’s recent write-down of its acquired Japanese fab from Micron should be a 
warning sign of the pitfalls inherent in Tower’s business strategy. Micron, once a key purchaser of product from Tower, now no 
longer buys product from it – one example that Tower is not participating in declining industry growth other than picking up old 
fab facilities.  The Panasonic deal shocked Spruce Point: Tower marks the JV at a 250%+ premium to that of Panasonic’s valuation


Questionable Management, Corporate Governance and Long-Term Alignment With Shareholders:  Tower’s CEO mysteriously 
omits his educational achievements, which suggests he did not even graduate from college, and is bizarre for a mature billion dollar 
semi foundry business. Meanwhile, the CEOs of Tower’s key peers all have advanced degrees, many with PhD’s. An apparent lack of 
formal education has not stopped Tower’s CEO from overseeing a company that has ravaged shareholders with massive dilution, 
well-timed stock options at inconsistently defined strike prices, and extravagant compensation and perks. Tower’s group of 18 
insiders earn a lavish 13% of SG&A expense (up from 6.6% in 2006 and compared with peers at 2 – 7.5%). Management is paid 
handsomely for promoting in the media that it will earn hundreds of millions a year for investors, issuing frequent press releases 
touting multimillion and billon $ market opportunities, yet haven’t demonstrated any sustained free cash flow in years


Punitive Equity Deals Hurt Shareholder Value: Acquiring revenues has come at a steep cost to shareholders: Since 2005, Tower’s 
share count has increased 33% p.a., outpacing revenue growth of 25% p.a. Its recent deals with Micron, Panasonic, and Maxim 
have each entailed significant equity issuances, and, in our opinion, reflect Tower’s dependence on propagating its share price to 
support deal activity. Not surprisingly, Tower has had difficulty maintaining a stable roster of shareholders. All of its earlier strategic 
shareholders (Sandisk, Alliance Semi, Macronix, Toshiba, QuickLogic) in the development of its second Israeli fab have sold, and its 
two largest Israeli shareholders (Israel Corp and Bank Leumi) have liquidated their stock holdings over the past two years (despite 
maintaining various board positions). Furthermore, the third largest shareholder, Bank Hapoalim, recently reduced its holding. U.S. 
shareholders should ask themselves do they know Tower better than the Israeli banks which financed it, along with Israel Corp, 
one of the country’s largest holding companies?

Evidence Suggesting Brazen Accounting Scheme To Forestall Bankruptcy Threat: In 2013 with its stock price at a multi-year low, 
Tower indicated it had a wall of debt maturities coming due in 2015. Coincidentally, in Dec 2013 Tower announced what it described 
as a “momentous” and “revolutionary foundry concept” JV deal with Panasonic which would add $400m+ of revenues. Panasonic’s 
tone was much more muted, and described the transaction as a consequence of difficulty in competing using these very same fab
facilities. In our opinion, Tower may have heavily promoted the Panasonic deal to inflate its stock, and convert its Series F debt to 
equity to relive its debt burden. We have evidence to suggest Tower inflated the value of the JV’s assets from approx. $100m to 
$300m in order to inflate a bargain purchase gain to bolster its equity. Furthermore, Tower has engaged in other questionable
accounting maneuvers to give the appearance of strong Non-GAAP gross margins, profitability, and free cash flow such as: 1) Shifting 
COGS expenses to R&D and SG&A; 2) Changing the presentation of capex from “gross” to “net”; 3) Extending the useful life of its 
assets to reducing depreciation expense; 4) Excluding depreciation and amortization to present Non-GAAP results (not industry 
standard); 5) Haircutting its convertible and bank debt by inappropriately interpreting the accounting guidance. It should also be no
surprise that Tower’s financial reporting and transparency is sub-standard compared with peers. We observe Tower doesn’t report 
key performance metrics and financial details such as 1) Revenue by technology or application; 2) Utilization figures; 3) Allowance for 
doubtful accounts; 4) Intercompany sales, and; 5) Financial guidance beyond sales among other things


Analyst Misperceptions and Valuation Disconnect:  Analysts price targets range from $17 - $28 per share (average $22/sh) 
suggesting 75% upside from the current price. Analysts base these price targets on the assumption that Tower will grow 2016 
revenues and Non-GAAP EPS by 13% and 23%, respectively, with larger peers and industry forecasts suggesting low single digit 
revenue growth, and declining YoY EPS. It is no surprise that analysts’ are claiming that Tower’s shares are cheap while trading at 
just 4.2x and 5.8x 2016E P/Non-GAAP EPS and EV/EBITDA, respectively. In our opinion, Tower’s Non-GAAP EBITDA and EPS is so 
highly adjusted with questionable accounting assumptions, that analysts’ estimates are practically useless. In our opinion, the true 
story is that Tower has a speculative business model that does not appear to make money, and appears dependent on issuing its
inflated equity to finance transactions with larger industry counterparties. As a result, we view a sales-based multiple as more
appropriate for valuing Tower. Its stock is currently trading at a 1.4x 2016E EV/Revenues. Investors should look at recent semi stocks 
dogged with accounting issues such as Magnachip Semiconductor (NYSE: MX) and Marvel Tech (Nasdaq: MRVL) as appropriate 
valuation peers. MX, which like Tower also operates outsourced foundry services,  recently went through an accounting restatement 
tied to errors in, among other things, revenue recognition, cost of goods sold, inventory reserves, capitalization, expense recognition 
and allocation, as well as related business practices, for distributor, non-distributor customers and vendors. Its core business loses 
money and it trades at 0.5x EV/revenues. Valuing Tower at between 0.5x and 0.8x 2016E revenues gets us a valuation range of 
approximately $3.00 - $6.00 per share (50 -75% downside).  Ongoing shareholder dilution would not be foreign for TSEM’s stock.

 Sept 2008:  $250m debt forgiveness with Israeli banks in exchange for convertible equity at $1.42/share1 and a $20m 
equity injection


 In May 2008, TSEM announced it would acquire Jazz Semiconductor in an all-stock deal for an enterprise value of $169m:
• History:  The assets were originally spun-out of Conexant as announced in 2002. Originally called “SpecialtySemi” 


before changing its name to Jazz Semiconductor, it was backed with capital from The Carlyle Group
• Acquicor, a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) raised $173m and in Sept 2006 acquired Jazz for $253m 
• Acquicor’s Jazz transaction was noted as a failure, particularly as the SPAC had a roster of big name, successful 


investors from Apple (Gil Amelio, Steve Wozniak and Ellen Hancock)
• By 2010, Jazz would need to restructure its debt:


• June 2010, June 2010, and July 2010: Jazz debt exchange of approximately $80m in aggregate principal 
amount of its outstanding $123m of 8% convertible senior bonds due 2011 for new non-convertible senior 
bonds due 2015. In addition, exchanging bond holders received warrants for the purchase of approximately 
25 million Tower ordinary shares at an exercise price of $1.70/share1


 March 2013: Israeli Bank loan extension, resulting in 2013 and 2014 principal payments being reduced from $105m to 
$30m. The outstanding loan of $131m, which was originally set to be paid starting September 2013, would be payable in 
10 quarterly installments, starting on March 2014 and ending on June 2016


 May 2013:  Equity rights offering proposed in the amount of $60m
 Oct 2014:  Bank debt refinancing
 March 2015: Accelerated Series F conversion


1) TSEM announced a 15:1 reverse split on 8/2/12


Warning: As a result of TSEM’s inability to create free cash flows over time, starting from 2008, the 


Company engaged in three debt restructuring agreements, 2 of which were with Israeli banks and 1 


was conducted by its US subsidiary (JAZZ) with US banks and creditors.

Tower Semiconductor’s enterprise value and valuation needs to be correctly adjusted for its true 


amount of debt outstanding, multitude of dilutive securities, and our estimated value of Panasonic’s 


non-controlling interest (NCI) in TPSCo. As we will illustrate later in our presentation, we believe Tower 


has taken overt actions to reduce its book value of debt outstanding, and minimize the value of the NCI.

 TSEM operates in the semiconductor manufacturing sector, an industry characterized by extreme price competition, short 
product cycles leading to rapid product obsolescence, and high capital intensity. It competes against lean and efficient global 
players. While all of TSEM’s manufacturing facilities are located in developed countries (Israel, US, Japan), in which the 
operating expenses, including costs of workforce and maintenance, are relatively high, the manufacturing facilities of its 
direct competitors are located in lower cost geographies such as China, Taiwan, Korea and Malyasia


 As illustrated in the table below, TSEM’s margins are, and have been for a long time, significantly lower than those of 
comparable companies:


 TSEM’s business strategy revolves around purchasing old and outdated fabrication facilities in developed countries. In the 
short period following the purchase, the sellers keep providing orders over the duration of the remaining product life cycles, 
and by doing so covers some of the fixed operating costs


 Tower has to prove it can bring new customers to these facilities, to absorb significant unused capacity, while it carries a high 
fixed-cost burden of operation (and in certain cases, unionized elder workforce where TSEM bears the liabilities for 
retirement and redundancy costs when the assets are retired)


 TSEM’s recent Micron deal, which resulted in a shut down of the facility and large impairment costs illustrate the challenges
of sustaining this strategy. Its recent Panasonic deal, promoted with great promise, may ultimately result in a similar outcome,
and we will explore this transaction in greater detail further in the presentation


 Tower may face challenges implementing its strategy in countries such as China, Taiwan, South Korea or India, where in recent 
years new fabrication facilities with advanced technologies are being built with massive capital investment and cooperation 
between some of the big player in the industry

Tower’s largest peers spend approximately 40% of annual sales on capex needs (maintenance and growth) and 


9% of sales on R&D. With new fabs running into the billions (eg. Taiwan Semi’s planned $3bn fab in China), the 


costs of maintaining competitiveness in the industry are sizeable. Tower has spent approximately 15% of sales 


on capex and 6% on R&D in the past few years – well below average.

To support our opinion that Tower doesn’t really make money, we have included below Tower’s first and 


second slides from its recent investor presentation. Tower is quick to point out its significant revenue 


growth over the past decade,  and recent revenue growth relative to peers. However, what Tower does 


not focus on are more critical financial metrics investors use to value a company such as EPS, EBITDA, 


Cash Flow, or Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)

 TSEM appears to be a struggling company lagging behind the industry that approaches 
customers who need small batches and/or need chips for products that are at their end of a 
life cycle. This technological lag leads to TSEM’s inability to integrate its products with 
technologically advanced digital chips, a problem that will only worsen in the future


 In addition, in our opinion TSEM is not an attractive purchase for a potential buyer, as it carries 
restrictions regarding the transfer and use of intellectual property and know how imposed by 
the state of Israel who gave the company significant amounts of grants for the construction of 
its Israeli fabs. Nevertheless, the state of Israel might remove this restriction in order to 
prevent the company from entering into default and mass layoffs of Israeli workers


 As a result of its business issues, TSEM does not appear to generate free cash flow according 
to our analysis on the next slide


 TSEM appears to use various subtle financial presentation distortions and accounting 
gimmicks to cover-up its business problems and its inability to generate free cash flows


 Meanwhile, TSEM frequently trumpets its business dealings with extensive press releases that 
often tout billion dollar market opportunities (example 1, 2, 3) and its recent Panasonic JV deal 
(which we will explore in great depth), which it calls “A Revolutionary Foundry Concept” (see 
Sept 2015 Company Presentation) – still these market opportunities have not generated in 
cumulative free cash flows

From 2004 to Q3’15, TSEM reportedly generated cumulative free cash flow losses of $607m.
*
While it appears 


that recently reported financial results indicate free cash flow is growing, we will present evidence later in the 


presentation that suggests TSEM changed its definition of capex from “gross” to “net.” This change could be 


confusing investors and inflating the appearance of free cash flow from 2013-Current. 


See this slide for complete details


* TSEM changed its capex presentation from gross to net of PP&E sales.  Adjusted FCF for 2013 and 2014 were ($40)m and $3m, respectively. YTD 2015 Adjusted FCF 
cannot be determined since TSEM does not provide investors details to determine proceeds from sold PP&E. Adjusted Cumulative FCF 2004-2014 is ($695)m

 As a result of the company’s inability to generate free cash flows over time, all of the 
company’s recent M&A transactions were funded, almost solely, with equity issuance 
(except for the Micron deal which 2/3 of it was funded with cash):
• May 2008: JAZZ stock-for-stock deal of approx. $40m 
• April 2011: Micron deal total consideration of $62.6m, of which $40m was cash 


and the rest was funded with equity issuance of 19.7 million ordinary shares.
• Dec 2013: Panasonic deal total consideration of $7.4m funded with issuance of 


870,454 TSEM ordinary share issuance
• Nov 2015: Maxim Deal, total consideration of $40m that will be funded with 


TSEM ordinary share issuance
 The fact that TSEM funds its M&A activity mostly with equity issuance (expensive 


capital), reveals potential difficulties it faces in raising cheaper debt from banks 
and/or institutional investors


 The frequent equity issuance could indicate that Tower believes its share price and 
market capitalization is overpriced

TSEM’s management does not appear to have created long-term shareholder value. While TSEM’s revenue 


growth from $100m in 2005, to almost $1 billion in 2015, appears impressive on the surface, it needs to be viewed 


in the context of management’s ability to grow revenues in a shareholder friendly manner. We find that TSEM’s 


basic share count has grown faster than its revenues. Meanwhile, sustainable GAAP profits remain elusive.

“We'll earn hundreds 
of millions a year”


March 29, 2015
Tower Semiconductor Ltd. (Nasdaq: TSEM; TASE: TSEM), once on the verge of 
bankruptcy, has a current market cap of NIS 5.2 billion - the same as First International 
Bank of Israel (TASE: FTIN) and Migdal Insurance and Financial Holdings Ltd. (TASE: 
MGDL), Israel's largest insurance company. No, this is not an overinflated bubble 
about to burst. Russell Ellwanger, the company's American CEO, has led a long 
process of recovery and building with many stumbling blocks since 2005.


Ellwanger, who will celebrate a decade in his post on May 1, does not conceal his excitement when he hears that Tower Semiconductor's 
share is getting closer to inclusion in the Tel Aviv 25 index. For him, the inclusion of an industrial-technological company like Tower 
Semiconductor in the index of Israel's 25 largest Tel Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) companies is both a personal achievement and a milestone for 
the local industry. "Being on the Tel Aviv 25 will be very exciting for us. I can't say whether or not it will happen, but if it does, it will be 
fantastic, amazing," he says in a special "Globes" interview marking his 10th anniversary as company CEO.


Tower Semiconductor, which manufacturers chips at its fabs in Migdal HaEmek, in California, and in Japan, is the hottest story on the TASE 
over the past 15 months. The company's market cap was still at NIS 650 million as recently as December 2013, following a 75% plunge in its 
value within 18 months, but in the last two weeks of 2013, the share skyrocketed 50%, after Ellwanger revealed an unexpected deal with 
Japanese electronic products company Panasonic.


So far this year, Tower Semiconductor's share has added 250% to its value, a jump that, last week, led most of the company's holders of 
Series F bonds convertible bonds to consent to early conversion of their bonds on preferred terms. This development will push Tower 
Semiconductor's market cap up to NIS 5.2 billion, putting it in 28th place on the TASE in market cap. This massive conversion of debt to 
equity is also expected to enable Tower Semiconductor to report cash balances in excess of its debt in its financial statements for the first 
quarter of 2015 – something that had seemed almost inconceivable.


“Russell Ellwanger took Tower Semiconductor from the brink of bankruptcy to 


being the hottest stock in Tel Aviv. He looks back, and sketches the next goal.”

An excellent Seeking Alpha article by Author Jay Yoon recently explored the questionable compensation strategies used by 


TSEM’s management to extract increasing cash comp and stock gains reaped at the expensive of shareholders with punitive 


and well-timed option grants.

Research Highlights:

amount of options at the expense of shareholders
 The Company appears to be using various techniques to minimize the exercise price of its options, as well as timing grants to coincide 


with key business events
 Management has also received large pay increases despite poor business performance. In less than ten years, total cash compensation 


to management has increased over 4x
 Due to the questionable actions of the board and the more lenient nature of certain Israeli securities laws, it is unlikely that 


management will change their behavior in the future

TSEM’s insiders appear to be good at increasing total compensation despite the substantial accumulated capital 


losses to shareholders. Total comp has risen at a 19% CAGR from 2005-2014. However, the compensation appears 


more egregious when viewed in the context as a percentage of TSEM’s total marketing, general and administrative 


(aka SG&A) expenses. As the table and chart below indicates, total comp is approximately 13.3% of expenses, up 


from approximately 8% in 2005. TSEM’s Board and management, a team of 18 people, reap the benefits in an 


organization with just shy of 4,000 total employees! Its total comp to SG&A is way out of line with competitors.

Gains recognized from bargain purchases are rare in practice, yet TSEM has twice recorded gains on purchases 


from sophisticated, multinational companies as sellers. In our opinion, the bargain purchase gains were created 


either from inflating the values of the acquired assets, or from deflating the value of non-controlling interest (NCI = 


the value of the equity not acquired by Tower) and/or not recognizing contingent liabilities of the acquisition.

 Bargain purchase: refers to a situation where the fair value of the net assets acquired exceeds the fair value of 
consideration transferred. Such excess is sometimes referred to as “negative goodwill”


 Mathematically:  Bargain Gain = Fair Value of Assets Acquired – Noncontrolling Interest (NCI) – TSEM Value Paid
 Financial Statement Impact:  EPS and Book Equity become overstated
 As illustrated in the table below, M&A deals conducted during the years 2011 (Micron) and 2014 (Panasonic) yielded gains 


from bargain purchase of $20m and $166m, respectively
 The aforementioned gains seem even more peculiar when examining the parties to these transactions: Micron and 


Panasonic, two much larger and global companies, which have a fiduciary duty towards their shareholder to create value, 
and whose financial stability aren’t in question

On first pass, TSEM reports a $19.5m gain on acquisition from the Micron deal, everything seems great!


 In our opinion, the purchase price allocation, the value of net tangible assets appears artificially inflated to $82m (Left Table)
 As a result, Tower recognized a gain from bargain purchase in the amount of $19.5m (increased from $10.5m)  (Right Table)
 TSEM paid $62.6m in a combination of $20m cash + $22.6m of TSEM stock
 Because the consideration paid ($62.6m) was less than the consideration received (estimated by TSEM at $82.1m), the 


company recognized a bargain purchase gain on acquisition of $19.5m ($82.1 – $62.6m)

 In early 2015 when announcing FY 2014 earnings, and after the Panasonic deal was announced, Tower ceased its 
operations in the Nishiwaki facility and recorded significant operational losses in addition to a $55m impairment


 The aforementioned chain of events, cast a big question mark on the appropriateness of the $19.5m bargain

 Micron’s Disclosure of the Tower Transaction:


On June 2, 2011, we sold our wafer fabrication facility in Japan (the "Japan Fab") to Tower Semiconductor Ltd. 
("Tower"). Under the arrangement, Tower paid $40 million in cash and approximately 20 million of Tower ordinary 
shares. In addition, we will receive an aggregate amount of $20 million in twelve equal monthly installments 
beginning in the second quarter of 2012. We recorded a gain of $54 million (net of transaction costs of $3 million) 
in connection with the sale of the Japan Fab. We also recorded a tax provision of $74 million related to the gain on 
the sale and to write down certain deferred tax assets associated with the Japan Fab. In connection with the sale of 
the Japan Fab, we entered into a supply agreement for Tower to manufacture products for us in the facility through 
approximately May 2014.

Curiously, in what appears a vote of no confidence in TSEM, Micron sold its TSEM stock in early 2013, 


before its revenue deal with TSEM expired in mid 2014.

 In March 2014, Tower acquired from Panasonic 51% of a newly established company, TowerJazz Panasonic Semiconductor Co., Ltd., 
(“TPSCo”), that manufactures products for Panasonic and potentially other third parties, using Panasonic's three semiconductor 
manufacturing facilities located in Hokuriku Japan


 Panasonic transferred its semiconductor wafer manufacturing process and capacity tools (8 inch and 12 inch) at three fabs to TPSCo, and 
entered into a five-year manufacturing agreement in a yearly estimated sales amount of $400m


 As consideration for Tower 51% equity holding in TPSCo, TSEM issued to Panasonic 870,454 of its ordinary shares valued at approx. $7.4m
 In the Purchase Price Allocation, we believe the value of net tangible assets was artificially inflated such that it summed to $181m. As a result 


(and as a result of deflating the balance of NCI by approximately $93 million contrary to generally accepted accounting principles), TSEM 
recognized a gain from bargain purchase in the amount of approximately $166.4m


 To date, we estimate TPSCo has incurred cumulative losses of approximately $42m. In the tables below the NCI shrunk from $7.1m to a 
negative balance of $13.7m on 6/30/15, or a cumulative loss of $20.5m, which represents 49%, so the total loss is $20.5 / 49% = $42m. 2 
years into the JV, research estimates it has achieved a small amount of third party revenues at $10m/quarter, a far cry from projected growth 
of $50m/quarter – this also impacts capacity yielding significant unused production room, our estimate is over 30% of unused capacity

Purpose of the JV of Diffusion Plants in Hokuriku Region


The semiconductor market has seen intensifying 
competition, causing dramatic changes to the business 
environment. To respond to this change, Panasonic has 
moved forward with a variety of measures that include 
structural transformation of the business, such as a shift 
from a focus on the audio-visual market to the 
automotive and industrial market, and the development 
of products and solutions that take advantage of 
Panasonic’s strengths of low power consumption, image 
processing, and compound technology


In order to respond to aim for accelerated enhancement 
of competitiveness and new growth of the 
semiconductor business, Panasonic decided to transfer 
the business relating to Semiconductor Wafer 
Manufacturing Process to the New Company, and 
thereafter, transfer of the 51% of shares in the New 
Company to TJ and make the New Company to be a joint 
venture company


Compare and contrast Panasonic and TSEM’s press releases announcing the formation of the JV.  Panasonic’s 


suggest a deal done out of necessity under gloomy conditions, whereas TSEM’s promotes the deal as 


“momentous” and “growth like no one else can (accomplish).” 


Amir Elstein, TowerJazz Chairman, stated, "I am pleased that 
we completed this strategic and momentous business 
agreement with Panasonic. The consolidation of our 
Japanese operations, resulting in significant reduction in fixed 
costs with an actual increase in available capacity and an 
enhanced technology offering, will strongly impact the 
company’s future profitability and shareholder value."


Russell Ellwanger, TowerJazz CEO, commented, "This joint 
venture and partnership brings together two leaders –
Panasonic, an acknowledged analog components and 
systems leader, and TowerJazz, a recognized analog foundry 
leader – to create a company that will serve and grow the 
analog foundry space as no existing single foundry company 
can. Over these months of negotiations and business and 
operational strategic planning and alignment, we have gained 
great respect for the technical capability and the great 
personal and corporate character of our Panasonic partner at 
all levels with which we've interacted. Already, enabled by 
this partnership, additional customers and products have 
been brought within the TowerJazz manufacturing umbrella 
whilst others anxiously await first engagements."

Cody Acree - Ascendiant Capital Markets - Analyst


“That is great, Russell. Thank you very much. Oren, maybe for 
you on the operating expense side because we did see such a 
large jump, can you just give us a bit of visibility as to what you 
are expecting going forward?”


Oren Shirazi - TowerJazz - SVP of Finance and CFO


“Yes, so like I stated in my part of the script, we have some of 
the costs that we knew that exist in the Panasonic transaction. 
Of course the Panasonic transaction brings positive EBITDA --
we didn't say exactly how much -- but when we went in-depth 
and looked at the costs, we saw that some portion of that 
should be allocated financially from cost of goods to R&D and 
SG&A of course like any other company. And indeed the R&D 
resources invested in TPS Co. in this Panasonic tower company 
is really big, really large so we allocated from COGS to R&D and 
SG&A the proper costs and basically what you see now and 
maybe a little bit because it is the first quarter maybe it is a 
little bit higher than usual but basically what you see now is a 
good indicator for the coming quarter which is just a 
classification internally between COGS and R&D. The total 
amount in the P&L is the same like we expected.”


Tower guides investors every quarter to look foremost at its revenues, and secondly, at its Non-GAAP Gross 


Margin. Curiously, the CFO disclosed that Tower would shift expenses from COGS to R&D and SG&A as part of 


the TPSCo formation. We find it difficult to understand how the CFO can justify a COGS expense as being R&D.

SEC Comment Letter Questions Panasonic Deal


Question 3. We see that in March 2014, you acquired 51% of the 
shares of TPSCo. through the issuance of common shares with a fair 
market value of approximately $7.4 million, and recorded a gain of 
$166 million. Please address the following:
• Describe for us the specific types of assets acquired and liabilities 


assumed and tell us
• Panasonic’s historical cost basis associated with each significant 


classification.
• Tell us the methodologies utilized to value each type of asset 


acquired and liability
• assumed, and describe the significant assumptions in each model.
• Describe for us how pricing for products sold to Panasonic will be 


established.


Question 4. You disclose that the fair values of TPSCo’s assets and 
liabilities are based on a valuation performed by third party 
professional valuation experts. Please revise future filings to clarify 
the nature and extent of the third party valuation experts’ 
involvement and management’s reliance on the work of the valuation 
experts. Refer to Question 141.02 of the Compliance and Disclosure 
Interpretations on Securities Act Sections, which can be found at 
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/sasinterp.htm, and 
would be applicable to the extent your Form 20-F is incorporated by 
reference into any registration statement


Response to Q4: “We accept your comment and will 
revise in future filings the related disclosure to clarify the 
nature and extent of the third party valuation experts’ 
involvement and management’s reliance on the work of 
the valuation experts In connection with such disclosure 
we will refer to the guidance in the Staff’s response to 
Question 141.02 of the Compliance and Disclosure 
Interpretations on Securities Act Sections.”


Response to Q3: Historical cost basis in Panasonic books was 
approximately JPY 165 billion, or approximately $1.65 billion 
(using an average exchange ratio of 100 JPY to each $1). The 
methodologies used- to value each type of asset acquired 
assumed and the significant assumptions in each model 
were as follows:
(a) Machinery: 96% sales comparison approach / 4% cost 


approach
(b) Intangibles: Relief-from-royalty method
(c) Inventory: WIP valued on future selling price per contract 


less cost of completion less normal margin 
Pricing is negotiated between the parties annually. Prices 
implemented a regressive price per product for gradually 
increasing orders, as such volume discounts are common

 As part of purchase price accounting , Tower is required according to GAAP (ASC 805), to record and present on its balance 
sheet the value of the NCI (Non-Controlling Interest) in TPSCo at fair value estimated through valuation techniques and 
methods 


 The requirement to use valuation techniques and methods in order to estimate the fair value of NCI is detailed in the 
following public accounting guides:


• PwC: Business Combinations and Noncontrolling Interests (2014)


• E&Y: Business Combinations (Oct 2015) 


 In contradiction to U.S. GAAP guidance, it appears that Tower elected to estimate and record the value of TPSCo’s NCI based 
on the consideration paid for its 51% stake in TPSCo resulting in the NCI being valued at $7.12m on TSEM’s balance sheet


• Recall that TSEM issued $7.4m of stock for 51% of TPSCo


• The implied equity value is therefore ($7.4m divided by 51%) = $14.5m


• The implied value of the NCI is therefore $7.4m multiplied by Panasonic’s 49% = $7.12m


 E&Y’s guide specifically addresses the inappropriateness of using the consideration paid in a transaction to measure the fair
value of the NCI:


“Given the considerations noted above, it generally is not appropriate to estimate the fair value of the noncontrolling
interest in a private company as simply the noncontrolling percentage of the equity value determined from grossing up 
the consideration transferred by the percentage of the company obtained by the acquirer. For example, if an acquirer paid 
$100 million for an 80% controlling stake in a private company, it would not be appropriate to assume that the fair value 
of the 20% noncontrolling interest is $25 million (i.e., 20% of an equity value calculated as $100 million divided by the 80% 
interest acquired). Additional analysis and valuation procedures are required”


By Maximizing the Accounting of the FV of Assets Acquired and Minimizing The Value of the NCI, 


TSEM Can Maximize The Value of its Bargain Purchase Gain


Bargain Gain = FV of Assets Acquired – NCI – TSEM Value Paid

 An alternative approach for valuing TPSCo’s NCI involves looking at public company multiple methods. The PwC guide gives 
an example that is based on a multiple of net income. 


 Detailed projections of TPSCo were not available at the time of the transaction. However, TSEM did say it expected the deal 
to produce $400m of revenues per annum. We are justified in using a multiple of sales based valuation approach

Accounting Tactic Timing Implication to Financial Statements


Large GAAP/Non-GAAP
Divergence, Driven By 
Excluding Depreciation from 
Non-GAAP results


Q1’2007 Shortly after the appointment of the CEO (and his grant of options totaling 4% of the company), 
TSEM started presenting Non-GAAP results, excluding depreciation and amortization from its 
financial results. For capital intensive businesses such as semiconductor manufacturing, this is 
highly unusual reporting practice (none of TSEM’s peers present this way) as it ignores an ongoing 
cost of doing business


Repeated Use of Bargain 
Purchase Gains


2011 and 
2014


As noted in the earlier section, TSEM accounted for two deals that resulted in rare “bargain 
purchase gains” totaling $19.5m in 2011 and $166m in 2014. In our opinion, this occurred as a 
result of either 1) inflating the purchase price allocation of the assets or, 2) deflating the valuation 
of the non-controlling interest. In either event, these gains bolstered both EPS and Equity


Beneficial Conversion Feature 
(“BCF”) Accounting


Q3’2012 In our opinion, incorrect BCF accounting allowed TSEM to reduce Series F convertible debt by 
approximately $50m, while overstating equity by the same amount


Shifting Expenses Q4’2014 As noted in the prior section, TSEM stated that it moved expenses from COGS to R&D and SG&A as 
part of looking at the TPSCo deal. TSEM places a heavy emphasis on reporting increasing Non-GAAP 
Gross Margin to investors. This odd adjustment merits scrutiny as it was not adequately explained


Fair Value Remeasurement 
of Bank Debt Q4’2014


TSEM lowered the book value of its bank debt by $24m (correspondingly increasing its book equity 
by a similar amount) by applying a Level 3 “income approach method.” Under GAAP, TSEM should 
have used a Level I method by referencing its publicly traded debentures in Israel, a more 
appropriate valuation method that would not have dictated lowering the value of its bank debt


Change in Definition of 
Capital Expenditures


Q4’2014 The industry standard definition of Free Cash Flow is Cash from Operations less Gross Capital 
Expenditures. Starting at FY End 2014, TSEM changed its reporting to Net Capex (net of asset sales), 
creating the appearance of positive Free Cash Flow (inclusive of asset sales). Reduced disclosures 
have make it difficult to determine if TSEM is truly cash flow positive (in our opinion it is not)


Change of Accounting for 
PP&E Affecting Useful Lives 
for Depreciable Assets


Q2’2015 Unjustified changes to the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment (15yrs from 7yrs and 
facility systems and infrastructure (extended to 25yrs from 14 yrs). For the three months period 
ended June 30, 2015, the impact of these extended estimated useful lives was approximately $14m 
reduced depreciation expenses which resulted in a net increase of approx. $6.8m, of net profit.

Income Statement Item Our Observations of Potential Issues


Revenue TSEM only provides revenue guidance and primarily grows through M&A.  An example of organic revenue 
destruction would be the from the Micron deal where revenues collapsed to nil over the course of the three year 
contract. TSEM doesn’t disclose sources of revenues (by technology, application, or for engineering, design and 
support services). TSEM also does not break-out intercompany revenues


Cost of Revenues In relation to the Panasonic JV, TSEM has re-classified certain undisclosed expense items from Cost of Revenues to 
SG&A and R&D, how could these items be confused?  The implication is that the numbers are harder to compare 
over periods. TSEM changed depreciation and amortization assumptions to lower GAAP expenses, and removes 
these expenses completely to show low Non-GAAP costs. Also in 2014, TSEM mysteriously boosted related-party 
energy purchases from Israel Corp, which could be below market prices. This amounts to 2% of COGS. Now the 
Israel Corp is no longer a shareholder, will costs increase in the future?


Gross Profit Not surprising that TSEM’s GAAP gross margins are significantly below peers, and its Non-GAAP gross margin is 
significantly inflated from removing depreciation and amortization


R&D Expense TSEM spends below industry average R&D. See cost of revenue commentary above on R&D reclassifications


Marketing and G&A See cost of revenue commentary above


Nishiwaki Restructuring 
& Impairment


Questionable charges in light of the fact TSEM booked a gain on the initial transaction


Interest expense, net TSEM has used debt revaluation tactics to lower reported interest expense. In our opinion, it also used a highly 
promotional Panasonic deal to inflate the stock, and cause a conversion of debt to lower its interest  burden


Gain from Acquisition Bargain purchase gains are rare in accounting practice, yet TSEM has twice recorded these gains. The gains 
improve earnings and also inflate book equity


Profit before taxes TSEM directs investors and readers to Non-GAAP numbers to avoid all the above negative issues at various line 
items in the income statement. On a GAAP and free cash flow basis, TSEM’s numbers are negative


We’ve attempted to illustrate the income statement impact from some of the accounting issues 


highlighted on the previous slide.
43


• In our opinion, during 2013 TSEM most likely realized that without drastic moves, starting at 2015, it would not be able to 
service its liabilities, and could face solvency issues. Accordingly, TSEM’s stock price approached a multi-year low in late 
2013. A payment schedule of the company’s financial liabilities, as illustrated by TSEM’s June 2013 investor presentation, 
revealed that during 2015 TSEM would need to repay $292m of its financial liabilities (in addition to $55m scheduled 
repayment during 2013-2014)


• It is reasonable to assume TSEM’s management knew it could face difficulties meeting upcoming debt maturities utilizing 
solely its free cash flows (we previously illustrated our belief that TSEM doesn’t generate positive free cash flows)


• It is possible that TSEM’s management plotted a plan to inflate its stock price (which was trading under $4/share in late 
2013), by promoting a “Revolutionary” deal with Panasonic, all for the purpose of allowing Series F debentures conversion 
feature to be “in the money” such that TSEM could convert its debt into shares, allowing it to avoid its repayment


• In order to execute this plan, we find evidence of many questionable accounting and financial presentation changes that 
are consistent with our belief that TSEM’s management was under pressure to keep the stock afloat

• In the first step, we believe TSEM executed the Panasonic deal, while spreading grand statements according to which this 
deal would generate significant profits, in addition to recognizing a gain from bargain purchase of $166m 


• In reality, we estimate TSEM has realized estimated operating losses of approximately $40m (during a period of 1.25 
years). Our opinion is supported by the growing loss of the JV’s non-controlling interest (NCI)


• Starting around 2012, in order to obscure its business problems, we believe TSEM appears to have engaged in various 
aggressive accounting techniques, all of which serve to overstate book equity, accounting profits, and free cash flow


• After a meteoric increase in the company’s share price, which started after the announcement of the Panasonic deal, 
during March 2015, the company initiated a plan to accelerate the conversion of its Series F debentures in order to 
prevent insolvency


• The reality proved that Tower’s plan was a success: As of 6/30/15, out of Series F $231m debt, $197m were converted to 
shares, such the outstanding balance of Series F debentures is almost zero (Source: Bloomberg)


• Nevertheless, despite the conversion of the majority of Series F debentures, which significantly decreased the company’s 
debt burden, we believe that TSEM’s business problems remain unchanged: TSEM constantly increases its income without 
generating free cash flows, and enters into short-term agreements, which in our opinion may be expected to end badly 
(operating losses during their operation and significant write-offs when the original deal term ends, similarly to the way 
the Micron deal ended)


• From March 2013 – July 2015 TSEM’s two largest shareholders completely eliminated their share holdings according to 
filings, while the third largest reduced ownership


• Curiously, during 2013 the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) issued a report to TSEM’s auditor, 
Deloitte Brightman Almagor, Zohar & Co noting significant audit deficiencies. While TSEM was not specifically mentioned, 
it is certainly worth carefully considering that the auditor had only 17 issuer clients at the time the report was issued


An array of questionable accounting changes, appears to have allowed TSEM to inflate its stock, relieve its debt 


burden with a conversion of debt to equity, and allow its largest Israeli shareholders to liquidate their stock 


positions from March 2013 onward

GAAP Non-GAAP Difference


Source: Tower Financials


 Not long after CFO and CEO Shirzi and Russell Ellwanger were appointed in October 2004 and April 2005, respectively, TSEM began 
to report its financial results on a Non-GAAP basis. The majority of the difference stems from excluding depreciation and 
amortization expenses


 On Nov 19, 2015, an Israeli business website called “The Marker” published an article authored by Shlomy Shuv, CPA. Mr. Shuv is 
considered to be an accounting expert in Israel specializing in detecting accounting problems. According to Mr. Shuv:


“It’s hard to accept excluding depreciation expenses in a heavily intensive capital investments company such as Tower…even 
in the American jungle of Non-GAAP reporting there are basic rules…the SEC rules forbid a local or foreign company to report 
(Reg G) – including in its press release, a Non-GAAP financial measure, which together with the rest of the attached information
might mislead or confuse the investors…item 10(e) of Regulation S-K prohibits to eliminate or smooth items identified as non-
recurring, infrequent or unusual, when the nature of the charge or gain is such that it is reasonably likely to recur within two
years, or there was a similar charge or gain within the prior two years. In the SEC official fillings, the company needs not only to 
detail the adjustment, but also to explain its importance.”

TSEM’s recent Q3’15 financial press release contain a dizzying amount of footnotes. The most 


questionable adjustment is its removal of depreciation and amortization from Cost of Revenues, R&D 


and Marketing and G&A expense items. 


(a) Includes depreciation and amortization expenses in the amounts of $47,439 and $39,944 and stock based compensation expenses in the amounts of $256 and $297 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 respectively. (b) Includes depreciation and amortization 
expenses in the amounts of $96 and $29 and stock based compensation expenses in the amounts of $319 and $259 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 respectively. (c) Includes depreciation and amortization expenses in the amounts of $497 and $200 and stock 
based compensation expenses in the amounts of $735 and $750 for the three months ended March 31, 2015 and March 31, 2014 respectively. (d) Non-GAAP interest expense, net include only interest on an accrual basis. (e) Non-GAAP income tax expense include taxes paid during the period on a 
cash basis. (f) The differences between the above-referenced GAAP profit (loss) results for the first quarter of 2015 as compared with the comparable periods' results are mainly due to: (i) $85 million other non cash financing expenses included in the three months ended March 31, 2015, 
primarily reflecting accelerated accretion resulted from the successful $162 million accelerated conversion of debentures series F (ii) $151 million gain from the acquisition of TPSCo included in the first quarter of 2014; and (iii) $71 million of costs related to Nishiwaki Fab cessation of operations 
recorded in the three months ended March 31, 2014. (*) Other non cash financing expense, net for the three months ended March 31, 2015 comprised primarily of accelerated accretion and amortization resulting from the $162 million accelerated conversions of debentures series F.

In our opinion, it is possible TSEM  made a change in the presentation of its capex in order to create a 


potentially confusing view to the untrained eye of free cash flows in the amount of $48m during 2014. 


 Cash flows from operations during 2014 summed to $97.7m ($125.3m excluding Nishiwaki fab closure employee related 
retirement cost), while purchases of property, plant and equipment (PP&E) summed to $50.2m (net of sales of PP&E), creating a
potentially misleading representation as if the company has $47.5m free cash flows ($75.1m excluding Nishiwaki fab closure 
employee related retirement cost).


 A thorough examination of TSEM’s cash flows from investing activities in 2014 reveals that it is presented net of a $45.4m cash 
flow from realization of PP&E sales. Digging even deeper uncovers that out of the approximate $45m of received from realization 
of PP&E sales, approximately $40m was related to realization of asset sales in the Nishiwaki fab, which is a one time line item:


B. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES


As of December 31, 2014, we had an aggregate amount of $187.2 million in cash and cash equivalents, as compared to $122.9 million 
of cash, cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits as of December 31, 2013, which included $10 million of designated deposits.


The increase in cash balance during the year was attributed mainly to $125.3 million cash generated from operating activities 
including interest payments of $34.0 million (or $159.3 million excluding these $34.0 interest payments) and excluding Japanese 
employee retirement related payments; investments of $99.4 million in fixed assets, net $57.6 million of cash in TPSCo associated 
with its establishment; repayment of $51.4 million of debt; proceeds from exercise of options and bond issuance of $19.6 million; and 
a receipt of an $85.9 million loan from JA Mitsui Leasing,  Ltd. and Bank of Tokyo (BOT) Lease Co., Ltd, two Japanese banks, that was 
used to repay the bridge loan previously received from Panasonic; in addition, funds received from Nishiwaki assets sale,  net of 
Japanese employee retirement related payments, amounted to $12.6 million.


 This amount excludes employee related retirement cost in the amount of $27m, implying that the gross amount related to the 
realization of the Nishiwaki’s assets totaled $40m). If we adjust the cash flow from investing to exclude the one time $40m 
received from the Nishiwaki’s assets, the resulting cash flow from PP&E sales is $90m and the free cash flow is jus $8m ($35m 
excluding Nishiwaki fab closure employee related retirement cost)
54


 TSEM’s statement of cash flows buries additional capital investment details in the amount of $27m during 2014, which we can 
see at the bottom of the statement under the title “Non Cash Activities: Investments in property and equipment”


 This capital investment was most likely carried out using supplier credit resulting in increased cash flows from operations


At the Bottom of its Cash Flow Statement, TSEM Reveals Non-Cash Capex 


 To support our opinion, on the next slide we have shown how two of Tower’s competitors disclose capex:


1. Taiwan Semiconductor: In the current liabilities of its balance sheet, it provides a very detailed disclosure of its 
accounts payable which includes: 1) trade payables, 2) related party payables, and 3) payables to contracts and 
equipment suppliers


2. United Microelectronics: provides details on payables related to capex at the bottom of its cash flow statements


 If we increase the Capex by an additional $27.5m, we conclude that during 2014 TSEM had a free cash flow deficit of 
approximately $20m (positive $7.5m free cash flows excluding Nishiwaki fab closure employee related retirement cost)

 We observe that Tower lists large “short-term liabilities” in the amount of $166.9m deep in its footnotes. This figure dwarfs its 
reported trade accounts payable ($98.6m) and other current liabilities ($16.6m) on the balance sheet at 12/31/14


 This suggests that Tower might not be recognizing the full amount of its capex payables on its balance sheet.
 As a result, its likely that Tower’s working capital condition might not be accurately portrayed

According to Note D from the Q2’2015 Financial Statements:


“In connection with periodic review of the reasonableness of the estimated remaining useful lives of property, plant and equipment of 
the Company’s foundry manufacturing facilities, it was determined that the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment 
should be extended to 15 years from 7 years and the useful lives of facility systems and infrastructure should be extended to 25
years from 14 years. The Company extended the estimated useful life of these assets as a result of use of mature technologies, longer 
processes and products’ life cycles, the versatility of manufacturing equipment, facility systems and infrastructure to provide better 
flexibility to meet changes in customer demand and the ability to re-use equipment over several technology cycles significantly 
extending the estimated usage period of such assets. For the three months period ended June 30, 2015, the impact of these extended 
estimated useful lives was approximately $14,000 of reduced depreciation expenses which resulted in a net increase of 
approximately $6,800 of net profit.”


During the second quarter of 2015, Tower decided to alter its fixed assets useful lives assumption in 


a manner which led to a decrease in the company’s depreciation expenses

 On October 25, 2010, the company announced $82m of commitments (approx. $100m ultimately raised) for Series F Convertible 
Debentures (Series F). Series F debentures carry an annual rate of 7.8% payable semiannually in NIS but linked to the $/NIS exchange rate. 
The debentures principal payment were scheduled to be paid in two installment of $53m on Dec 2015 and Dec 2016:


• The debentures were convertible into Tower's ordinary shares during the period commencing in Sept 2012 and ending in Dec 2016, 
with a conversion price that shall be equal to 120% of the avg. trading price of its shares on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange during the 
15 trading days before Sept 18, 2012, provided that in no event will the price be more than NIS 6.5, and not less than NIS 1.0 


• In 2012, Tower raised an additional $105m (Feb 2012: $80m and Oct 2012: $25m) through the expansion of Series F debentures, 
such that the total aggregated amount raised by Series F amounted to $231m  


 The conversion price was initially 38.21 NIS par value of debentures into one ordinary share. In June 2013, the conversion ratio was 
adjusted to NIS 36.276 ($9.80/share)


 As reported in Q3’2012, Tower classified $110m of its Series F debentures as equity, and reduced long-term debt by a corresponding 
amount as disclosed below:


“In accordance with ASC 470-20 (formerly EITF 98-5 and EITF 00-27), a Beneficial Conversion Feature (BCF) exists for bonds series F, 
which has been measured in accordance with such standards at $110 thousands, classified as an increase in shareholders' equity with a 
correspondence decrease in the carrying value of the debentures presented as long term liabilities; said amount will be accreted  through 
the remaining life of the debentures to the non-cash financing expenses.”


 On March 10, 2015, just one month after reporting its “Highest Ever Quarterly and FY 2014 Revenues With Strong Organic Growth,” Tower 
offered to accelerate the conversion of $40m of Series F debentures. This conversion included a 1% benefit. The proposal was 
oversubscribed, such that $80m were converted. After this conversion, Series F debentures remaining principal amounted to 
approximately $35m


 In the next slide, we will illustrate why we believe this account presentation appears misleading, and designed to enhance the financial 
position of TSEM by reducing debt + overstating equity


In our opinion, the Series F debentures were incorrectly accounted for to understate debt and improve the 


appearance of TSEM’s financial condition. Furthermore, by over-hyping recent deals and inflating TSEM’s earnings 


and share price, the company could convert the Series F debentures to equity and relieve its financial burden.

 The BCF guidance addresses situations in which a debt or equity security is issued with a nondetachable (embedded) conversion 
option that is beneficial to the investor (in the money) at inception because the conversion option has an effective strike price 
that is less than the market price of the underlying stock at the commitment date.


• The accounting for a BCF requires that the BCF be recognized by allocating the intrinsic value (not the fair value) of the 
conversion option to additional paid-in capital, resulting in a discount on the convertible instrument.


 In accordance with ASC 470, the Commitment Date is defined as follows:


"The commitment date is the date when an agreement has been reached that meets the definition of a firm 
commitment.”


 Definition of a “Firm Commitment” - an agreement with an unrelated party, binding on both parties and usually legally 
enforceable, with the following characteristics:


a. The agreement specifies all significant terms, including the quantity to be exchanged, the fixed price, and the timing of 
the transaction. The fixed price may be expressed as a specified amount of an entity’s functional currency or of a foreign 
currency. It may also be expressed as a specified interest rate or specified effective yield. The binding provisions of an 
agreement are regarded to include those legal rights and obligations codified in the laws to which such an agreement is 
subject. A price that varies with the market price of the item that is the subject of the firm commitment cannot qualify 
as a fixed price. For example, a price that is specified in terms of ounces of gold would not be a fixed price if the 
market price of the item to be purchased or sold under the firm commitment varied with the price of gold.


b. The agreement includes a disincentive for nonperformance that is sufficiently large to make performance probable. In 
the legal jurisdiction that governs the agreement, the existence of statutory rights to pursue remedies for default 
equivalent to the damages suffered by the nondefaulting party, in and of itself, represents a sufficiently large disincentive
for nonperformance to make performance probable for purposes of applying the definition of a firm commitment


In our opinion, TSEM’s interpretation of the accounting treatment for a Beneficial Conversion Feature (BCF) was not 


in accordance with GAAP and in particular ASC 470-20 and its specific interpretations. Therefore, we believe TSEM’s 


debt, as of 30 September 2012, was understated by $50m to $110m and its equity overstated by the same amount

 Recall The Facts:  


1. Approx. $100m of Series F convertible debentures were issued in October 2010 and additional $105m (Feb 2012: $80m and Oct 2012: $25m) 
through the expansion of Series F debentures, such that the total aggregated amount raised by Series F amounted to $231m. 


2. The debentures were convertible into Tower's ordinary shares during the period commencing in Sept 2012 and ending in Dec 2016, with a 
conversion price equal to 120% of the avg. trading price of its shares on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange during the 15 trading days before Sept 18, 2012


 As of the Series F issuance date in Oct 2010, one of the most significant conditions of conversion deal was not set: the fixed conversion price


 The conversion price was set on September 18, 2012 (at the time of the determination of the conversion price). Thus, the commitment date as defined 
in ASC 470 is this date  (assuming BCF accounting is relevant) and not the issuance dates, as assumed by TSEM


 From the way the conversion price was determined (20% premium on the average price), it’s clear that on September 18, 2012, which is the 
commitment date for the purpose of examining the existence of BCF, a BCF didn’t exist as the conversion feature, by definition, was out of the 
money by 20%!


 The accounting treatment at the initial issuance date (in 2010) - According to Note 12 of TSEM’s annual financial statement 20-F 2010, Series F (as a 
whole) was carried at amortized cost. Tower evaluated the conversion feature in accordance with the criteria established in ASC 815-40 “Contracts in 
Entity’s Own Equity” and concluded that bifurcation is not required (i.e., Series F as a whole, was accounted for as a liability under the amortized cost 
method)


 Therefore, starting with TSEM’s Q3’2012 financial statements,  and assuming TSEM’s initial accounting treatment of Series F convertible debt described
above was appropriate, we believe its shareholder’s equity is inflated by approximately $50m, while on the other hand, the company’s financial 
liabilities balance was deflated in the same amount


TSEM examined the existence of a BCF and estimated its value in relation to Series F issuance dates, while these 


dates didn’t fulfil the definition of “commitment date” since the conversion rate was not yet known.


We Believe TSEM’s Series F Debt Maturity is Artificially Low By $110m

In Our Opinion, The Proper Accounting Treatment for Tower's Convertible Debentures Series F:


• As we learned, under U.S. GAAP significant analysis takes place before addressing a beneficial conversion feature
(BCF). One must first rule out the application of embedded derivative accounting under ASC 815


• In our opinion, as of the issuance dates, an examination of whether embedded derivative exists in accordance with
ASC 815, should have yielded a positive result1. That is, TSEM should have bifurcated Series F convertible debt and
revalue the embedded derivative at fair value through P&L at every reporting period until the determination of the
conversion price (the bifurcated derivative in this case is a conversion Asian (call) option, which its strike price
depends on the average price of the underlying asset (Tower share price) during a predetermined averaging period).


• It should be noted that bifurcated derivatives should be reassessed every reporting period to determine if they
continue to require bifurcation. That is, they are reassessed to see if they still meet the definition of a derivative and
still fail to qualify for any scope exception from derivative accounting. In our opinion, in 2012 when the conversion
price was set, the "fixed-for-fixed" concept (pursuant to ASC 815-40-15-5 through 15-8) was held, and the
embedded conversion feature of Series F was no longer considered a bifurcated derivative.


• ASC 815-15-35-4 requires a previously bifurcated conversion option that no longer requires bifurcation to be
reclassified from a liability to equity at its then-current fair value on the date of reclassification. The conversion
option is not recombined with the host debt instrument. Gains or losses recognized when the bifurcated conversion
option was accounted for at fair value during the period that the conversion option was classified as a liability are
not reversed


• We estimated (using Black and Scholes model) that the amount to be reclassified to the equity would have been
approximately $60 million (i.e. this is the estimated fair value of the embedded derivative at the conversion price
determination date)


• Given the aforementioned, in our opinion, TSEM’s improper accounting treatment resulted in its equity being
inflated by approximately $50m as of Q3-2012 ( =$110m-$60m)

 Tower’s remaining bank loan principal balance as of 12/31/14 was $101m related to loans the company borrowed from Bank 
Leumi and Bank Hapoalim (“Israeli Banks”) (Source: 2014 20-F, p.49). These loans carry a yearly interest rate of LIBOR + 3.9% and 
its principal is expected to be repaid over the next years until 2018. For the propose of ensuring the repayment of these loans, 
Tower had to pledge all of its assets as a collateral. Tower is obligated toward the Israeli Banks to maintain certain restrictive 
financial covenants


 TSEM disclosed the following in on page F-20 in the notes to the debt facility agreement with the Israeli Banks:


“Loans received under the Facility Agreement, as amended to date, are presented at fair value, with changes in value reflected 
in the statements of operations, following adoption by the Company of ASC 825-10 “Fair Value Option” and Tower’s election to 
apply the fair value option to the Facility Agreement.”


 GAAP allows a company to revalue its loan principal; however, according to ASC 820, which details the fair value hierarchy and 
determines the priority of inputs to be used in valuation techniques, highest priority must be given to (unadjusted) quoted prices 
in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs


 For details of the fair value hierarchy in accordance with ASC 820 see PwC’s Fair Value Measurement Guide (2015) guide below:


Figure 4-3: Characteristics of Each Level in the Fair Value Hierarchy

Total Pmt (P+I) $14.2 $17.8 $59.2 $21.9


Maturity (yrs) 0.5 1.5 2.5 3.5


 As presented in the table below from TSEM’s 20-F Annual Report (Note 12-A), TSEM revalued its bank debt principal by $24m 
(the notes further specify it to be specific to the Israeli bank debt) such that ($101m -$24m) = $77m was represented on its 
balance sheet as of 12/31/14.


 A revaluation of the debt at year end 2014 at yield consistent with a junk credit is highly suspicious in light of the fact that just two 
months earlier, Tower had refinanced its bank debt at L+3.9%


 Based on Tower’s remaining loans principal “Fair Value” of $77m, and according to an estimated principal repayment schedule as 
detailed in the company’s financial statements, and L+3.9bp cost of debt, we have calculated the embedded yield approx. 17.0%.

 In Note 14 (D) of TSEM’s 2014 Annual Report, is details its “Fair Value Measurements” and “Valuation Techniques” details:


“Tower's loans - for Tower’s loans from the Israeli Banks, fair value is based on the income approach using a present value 
technique under which the cash flows used in the technique reflect the cash stream expected to be used to satisfy the obligation 
over its economic life. Tower discounted expected cash flows as forecasted each quarter using the appropriate discount rate for 
the applicable maturity based on the expected contractual payments, by observing yields on similar traded debts.”


 TSEM specifies that Level 3 or “Significant Unobservable Inputs” were used to measure the debt’s fair value:


 TSEM also discloses it has recognized a gain through earnings in respect of the measurement
65


 As of 12/31/14, Tower’s Senior Unsecured debentures, which are linked to Israeli CPI, with a duration of approximately 1.5 years
(Series D) were traded at a price that reflected a 3.5% YTM (See below data from Bloomberg and Israeli’s Triple-A System for bond 
prices). Adjusting the aforementioned yield to the bank loans and for currency risk results in an appropriate yield of approximately 
5.5%.


 However, since the bank loans are secured with TSEM’s assets serving as collateral (Senior Secured), a downward adjustment needs to 
be made from the YTM of unsecured traded debt, which we conservatively estimate at 1.0%-1.5%.


 Given the aforementioned Series D YTM, and the appropriate adjustments (duration, currency and seniority), we believe that the bank 
loans’ contractual interest (LIBOR + 3.9%) represent fair market conditions


 As a result, it is our opinion is appears that TSEM’ revaluation of its banks loans, as of 12/31/14, and in complete contrast to generally 
accepted accounting principles, inflated the company’s shareholder’s equity in an estimated net (after adjusting for taxes) amount of 
$20m


We found that TSEM has traded debt on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, which could have been utilized in order to directly 


estimate the appropriate discount rate, which would have be classified as “Level 2.” This implies that TSEM had to, first and 


foremost, estimate its banks loan discount rate using its traded debt, and not the “income approach” using a discounted 


cash flow analysis!

 In its 2014 20-F Annual Report (Note 11B, p. F-20), Tower omits financial disclosure of the key and material covenants it is 
expected to maintain:


“The Facility Agreement also contains certain restrictive financial ratios and covenants. Satisfying these financial ratios and 
covenants is a material provision of the Facility Agreement. If, as a result of any default, the Israeli Banks were to 
accelerate Tower’s obligations, Tower would be obligated, to, among other things, immediately repay all loans made by the 
Israeli Banks plus penalties, and the Israeli Banks would be entitled to exercise the remedies available to them under the 
Facility Agreement, including enforcement of their liens against all of Tower ’s assets. The Facility Agreement contains. 
among others, (i) a mechanism for early repayment of certain principal amounts based on excess cash flow Tower may 
incur; (ii) required financial ratios and covenants Tower has to meet, as well as definitions of event of defaults.”


 From an examination of the company’s 2011 20-F Annual Report (p. 48 and filed April 4, 2012), we found the following:


“Under the terms of its amended facility agreement, Tower must meet certain financial ratios, including mainly financial 
covenants relating to quarterly sales and quarterly EBITDA (earnings excluding interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization). Under the terms of the amended facility agreement, satisfying these financial ratios and covenants is a 
material provision.”


 And further from the 2010-F Annual Report (p. 49):


“Under the terms of its amended facility agreement, Tower must meet certain financial ratios, including mainly financial 
covenants relating to quarterly sales, quarterly earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (quarterly 
EBITDA), “life of loan coverage ratio” (which is the ratio of the Fab 2 net cash flow to the total debt related to Fab 2 in any 
quarter), ratio of debt to EBITDA and ratio of equity to assets. Under the terms of the amended facility agreement, 
satisfying these financial ratios and covenants is a material provision”


Disturbing pattern of TSEM providing shareholders less and less visibility into its 


material financial bank debt covenants. Is it a coincidence that discussion about the covenants was 


reduced leading up to the “momentous” and “revolutionary” business agreement with Panasonic?

What Exactly Is Meant By “Long-Term”


Within Two Years, Israel Corp Would Completely Liquidate Its 39% Position


Source: Tower Press Release, March 25, 2013


Israel Corporation Has Elected to Convert All of Its TowerJazz Capital Notes into Ordinary Shares


Israel Corporation Stated It Has No Intention to Trade or Sell the Ordinary Shares and Will Hold 
Them as a Long-Term Strategic Investment


MIGDAL HAEMEK, Israel, March 25, 2013 – TowerJazz, the global specialty foundry leader, today 
announced that the Israel Corporation, its major shareholder, has elected to convert all its capital 
notes into approximately 13.7 million ordinary shares of the Company. IC stated in its recent annual 
report filed on March 21, 2013 that it has no intention to trade or sell the ordinary shares it holds, 
totaling approximately 39% of the Company's ordinary shares.


Nir Gilad, Israel Corporation CEO, stated: "The conversion of our capital notes into shares is in line 
with our long term investment in TowerJazz, our belief in TowerJazz's strategy and our wish to 
become a major shareholder with 39% strategic ownership. As we stated in our financial 
statements, we have no intention to sell or trade these shares".

 Up until 1/7/15 (“the Structure Split Date”), Israel Corporation Limited (Symbol: ILCO), which is one of Israel’s largest 
holding companies, was the majority shareholder in Tower holding 27% equity stake


 On the Structure Split Date, Israel Corp operations were split, such that:
 Its high quality holdings (cash cows) remained in direct ownership (Israel Chemicals and Bazan Group), 
 Its less successful holdings, such as Zim, Qoros and Tower, were transferred to Kenon Holdings Ltd., a company 


denominated in Singapore and traded on NYSE and TASE under the ticker “KEN”
 Simultaneously, Israel Corp distributed the Kenon shares as dividend in kind to its shareholders resulting in Israel 


Corp balances being clean from any Kenon holdings.
 On April 30, 2015, Tower’s parent company Kenon proposed to its shareholders that it would distribute its Tower 


share as dividend in kind
• The distribution considered some, or all, of the 18,030,041 ordinary shares of Tower held by Kenon, as well as 


1,699,795 ordinary shares of Tower underlying the 1,699,795 Series 9 Warrants of Tower held by Kenon
 On May 27, 2015, Kenon approved the distribution of its Tower shares


• 100% of the Kenon shareholders voting at the EGM voted in favor of the Proposal
 In light of our belief that Tower has poor free cash flows, and illiquid assets with limited marketability, it appears to 


have had few options of repaying its $197m of outstanding Series F debentures due in June 2015
 The conversion of Series F debentures totaling approximately $200m prevented Tower from the possibility of 


reaching insolvency, strengthen its shareholder’s equity, and reduced its financing expense all at the expense of 
significant dilution of its shareholders (which by now are accustomed to dilution after many rounds of dilutions over 
the years of Tower operations)


Is it just a coincidence that TSEM’s largest shareholder decided to distribute its shares in-kind at 


a multi-year high in the stock, and following “record financial results.”

Buys vs. Holds


TSEM analysts see average upside to $22/share or 47% above the current trading price. Notably, 


analysts base their price targets on Tower’s Non-GAAP EPS which we pointed out excludes 


depreciation and amortization and is not industry standard presentation.

$ in millions, except per share figures


TSEM “looks cheap” on large revenue 
and EPS growth estimates, but in our 
opinion, the revenue and EPS quality 
are very low. There is not enough 
evidence to suggest that TSEM’s 
earnings translate to Free Cash Flow 


Magnachip / MRVL are great comps 
for TSEM, both having been 
ensnared in recent accounting 
scandals. MX is the more relevant of 
the two since it operates an 
outsourced foundry service business.


Typically, you get what you pay for and there is no free lunch with investing. We believe TSEM is cheap because it 


trades on highly “adjusted Non-GAAP” results, yet has not proven an ability to generate sustained free cash flow.  It is 


not unreasonable to value TSEM on a multiple of revenue and compare its valuation to Magnachip, a foundry services 


provider that loses money, and had accounting issues come to light.

Debt and Equity Financings, Oct 2015
79


1) Box A: Is the debt instrument required to be accounted for at fair value under US GAAP or, if eligible, has the issuer elected to recognize the


debt at fair value?


Answer: No.


The debt instrument doesn't require fair value application, and the company has not elected the fair value method (under ASC 820).


2) Box B: Does the debt instrument contain embedded features?


Answer: Yes.


The instrument (Series F) is a convertible bond (hybrid instrument). As such, it comprised of a debt host and a conversion option (embedded feature).


3) Box D: Evaluate each embedded feature for bifurcation from a debt host instrument. Box D(A): Is there a conversion or exchange feature?


Answer: Yes.


The debt instrument includes conversion option.


4) Box D1: Is the feature clearly and closely related to the debt host?


Answer: No.


The economic characteristics and risks of the embedded feature are not clearly and closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host


contract.


5) Box D2: Does the feature meet the definition of a derivative?


Answer: Yes.


A separate instrument with the same terms as the embedded derivative would be considered a derivative instrument subject to derivative accounting (the initial


net investment for the hybrid instrument should not be considered to be the initial net investment for the embedded derivative).


6) Box D3: Is the feature eligible for an exception from derivative accounting?


Answer: No.


The conversion price for the Series F Convertible Debentures was unknown at the original issue date (October 2010), and it shall be equal to 120% of the


average trading price of the Company’s ordinary share on the Tel-Aviv Stock Exchange (TASE) during the 15 trading days in Israel before September 18, 2012.


Therefore, the "fixed-for-fixed" concept wasn't held due to the fact you don't know what would be the conversion price (and therefore, you don't know what


would be the conversion ratio, i.e., the number of common shares received at the time of conversion for each convertible security).


7) Conclusion (Box E): Bifurcate from the proceeds allocated to the debt host the fair value of a single derivative that comprises all of the


individual features requiring bifurcation.
