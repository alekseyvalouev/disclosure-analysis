 COMPANY:  Hosa International  Ltd.│ HKEX: 2200 


INDUSTRY:  Fitness Wear 
 


Hosa International Limited (HK:2200) (“Hosa” or the “Company”) designs, manufactures and wholesales swimwear and 


fitness wear under two primary brand names, Hosa and Water Cube.  On June 29, 2018, Hosa’s stock price plunged down 


87% from banks selling management’s shares held as collateral from previous margin financing arrangements.   





We were short Hosa into this event.  We believe that Hosa management has constructed a fraudulent scheme to bilk 


unsuspecting creditors and minority shareholders out of their investments using a web of undisclosed related party 


distributors and suppliers to fabricate reported revenues and profitability.  Using Credit Reports from Hosa’s primary 


distributors, we estimate Hosa fabricated revenues of RMB 685 million and RMB 894 million in 2016 and 2017, 


respectively, an overstatement of 217%! Additionally, Bloomberg intraday trading data suggests that Hosa’s stock has 


been manipulated upward in the last hour of trading for the past 6 months, a tactic we have seen used by other listed 


companies to artificially inflate the value of pledged shares used as collateral for margin financing. 





On July 10, 2018, the Company’s announcement confirmed that 10.966 million shares were sold by the banks on June 


29th, a mere 1.9% of the 589 million shares that management pledged to secure margin financing arrangements.  


Alarmingly a whopping 35.37% of the company’s shares were pledged as collateral for financing agreements! 





This means that there are an additional 579 million shares still pledged TODAY as collateral for margin loans, 


roughly ~35% of the Company’s shares! 





In this report we present publicly available SAIC filings, Credit Reports, Chinese court judgements and desktop research 


to support our opinion that Hosa has reported fabricated its financial performance to investors.  Sadly, we think that 


investors are too late to recoup their investment, as the Shi brothers have already been able to siphon off capital raised 


into their own pockets via share pledges, undisclosed related party transactions, and stock dividends.  We note that on 


July 5, 2018, Hosa announced it would delay payment of its dividend, increasing our concern that there is very little actual 


cash for investors to recoup from Hosa during this unwinding process.  





We have seen this story before with Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy where management levers up a small operating business 


in the form of a listed public company, manipulates the stock price higher in the last hour of trading and pledges public 


shares to siphon funds from unsuspecting investors into management’s own pockets.  Once uncovered, these stories have 


swift endings but unfortunately do not end well for minority investors. 





Laden with debt and little cash with a business significantly smaller than reported in its filings, we think the 


intrinsic value of Hosa’s equity is HKD 0.00.

1. Intraday Trading Data Patterns Indicate Stock Manipulation.  We analyzed intraday trading patterns and found 
that the price appreciation and volume increase in Hosa’s stock since December 2017 is due to unusual gains posted 


in the final hour of trading.  We think that management purposely executed the last hour manipulation scheme to 


prop up Hosa’s daily closing price to secure additional short-term financing and avoid margin calls on previously 


pledged shares. This creates a highly unstable situation where banks hold highly overvalued stock as collateral as 


evidenced by the 87% price decline on June 29th, 2018.  As share prices fall, we believe that the banks will be forced 


to sell the additional shares held as collateral to secure outstanding margin financing agreements. This will cause the 


share prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more pledged shares. In our opinion, this is the exact scenario 


which caused a sudden, dramatic collapse in the price of Hosa, Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy shares.  





a. Hosa’s Stock Price Rises Inexplicably in the Final Hour of Trading.  Evidence of manipulation can be 
found in intraday trading patterns, particularly the appreciation of a company’s stock in the last hour of trading. 


Gains throughout the trading day, over time, should be uniform. If an investor bought and held Hosa’s stock 


from December 12, 2017 through June 25, 2018, it would have generated a loss of 0.43%.  But if an investor 


bought Hosa’s stock at the beginning of the last trading hour and sold at the close of the trading day (and 


reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Hosa’s stock would have returned an inexplicable 


76% over that same period! This staggering difference is highly unusual when compared to other Hong Kong 


stocks, and in our opinion, strong evidence of manipulation. 





b. Shi Brother’s Pledged Shares as Short-Term Loan Collateral – Expect Additional Margin Calls from 
Share Price Decline.  On June 29, 2018, Hosa’s stock price plunged down 87% as a result of banks selling 


management’s shares held as collateral from previous financing arrangements. The two largest holders of 


Hosa stock are Mr. Shi Hongliu (Chairman) and his brother Mr. Shi Hongyan (collectively the “Shi Brothers”).  


On July 10, 2018, the Company’s announcement confirmed that 10.966 million shares of the Shi brother’s 


holdings were sold by the banks on June 29th, 2018, a mere 1.9% of the 589 million shares that management 


had pledged to secure margin financing arrangements.  This means that a whopping 35.37% of the company’s 


shares were pledged as collateral for financing agreements.  As the collateral requirements are recalculated 


for the remaining pledged shares, we expect further downside to Hosa’s share price. 
 
2. Revenue Fabrication Using Undisclosed Related Party Distributors.  SAIC Filings, Credit Reports, Chinese court 


judgements and desktop research reveals the Shi brothers currently retain undisclosed related party connections with 


multiple distributors which we believe has allowed the Shi brothers to fabricate revenues from these secretly 


controlled customers and artificially inflate Hosa’s reported financial performance in its public filings to investors.  





Since 2011, Hosa has purportedly generated approximately 50% of its total revenues from its five largest customers.  


Using Hosa reported figures, we would expect to see average costs of goods sold (“COGS”) for each top 5 customers 


of RMB 115 million and RMB 121 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  Credit Reports for Hosa’s three primary 


distributors, Shanghai Xingchi, Guangzhou Yingchang, and Beijing Yasha, reveal significantly lower COGS and 


operating activity as compared to what Hosa claims to have sold to its top 5 customers in 2016 and 2017.  Shanghai 


Xingchi’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 33 million and RMB 31 million in 2016 and 2017, 


suggesting that Hosa overstated sales to Shanghai Xingchi by at least 243% and 289% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 


Guangzhou Yingchang’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 35 million in both 2016 and 2017, 


suggesting that Hosa overstated sales to Guangzhou Yingchang by 228% and 242% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 


Beijing Yasha’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 62 million and RMB 26 million in 2016 and 2017, 


suggesting that Hosa overstated sales to Beijing Yasha by 85% and 372% in 2016 and 2017, respectively. 





We do not think Hosa’s revenue overstatement practices are isolated to these three distributors considering additional 


undisclosed related party transactions exist between Hosa management and other distributors.  If we apply Hosa’s 


2016 and 2017 overstated revenue percentage for its three primary distributors to its reported total revenues, we 


estimate Hosa fabricated revenues of RMB 685 million and RMB 894 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, 


and overstatement of 217%! We estimate that Hosa’s actual 2016 and 2017 total revenues were RMB 419 


million and RMB 304 million, respectively, 32% of what Hosa reported to investors.

3. Undisclosed Related Party Suppliers.  Hosa claims in its filings that its only meaningful related party transactions 
have been products and services supplied by Haosha Garments and minimal sales to Haosha Fitness Centers.  


However we think this is a lie.  According to the government website of Datian City, Fujian Haote Textile Technology 


Co., Ltd. (“Haote Textile”) is the construction entity for Haosha’s RMB 500 million Sports Culture Industry Park in 


Datian.  Banner advertisements at the site of the construction project disclose that Hosa is responsible for the project, 


yet at the same time lists the name of Shi Hongliu’s private business Haosha Intl. as the project constructor!  


Additionally, we uncovered that Shi Shaoteng, an executive president of Hosa, despite having ties to Jiashi Youpin, 


a primary online Hosa distributor, operates a textile business in Fujian which we suspect supplies goods to Hosa.  


Fraudsters need help from undisclosed related parties to avoid additional scrutiny of its reported transactions between 


parties.  This is cleary another instance whereby Hosa management has failed to disclose the connectivity of its 


executive president to supposed independent third party entites. 




















VALUATION 





In this report we present publicly available evidence that suggests trading in Hosa’s stock is manipulated and that 


Hosa’s reported financial statements are fabricated.  In our opinion, the Shi brothers have used these mechanisms to 


raise money from the capital markets and siphon off funds through cash dividends, stock pledges, and undisclosed 


related party transactions to insiders.   





We suspect that Hosa has been consistently fabricating its financial performance since its IPO, and that these fake 


profits have been carried on its balance sheet and the balance sheets of undisclosed related party distributors and 


suppliers as accounts receivables, inventories, payables and fixed deposits.  As discussed in this report, we estimate 


Hosa fabricated revenues of RMB 685 million and RMB 894 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, an 


overstatement of 217%! 





In our experience when management fabricates transaction volumes with the help of undisclosed related parties, we 


expect a large corrruption discount to the reported financial performance and a discount to the assets reported on its 


balance sheet. 





Coupled with trading manipulation and stock pledges, we believe that once the fraudulent scheme is understood by 


investors, Hosa’s will no longer have access to additional capital and Hosa management will face additional margin 


calls.  





As with other uninvestible ideas such as Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy, we believe Hosa’s equity will ultimately be 


worth zero.

INTRODUCTION 





Companies reporting fabricated financial statements often follow a pattern.  In the case of Hosa, the proverbial “too 


good to be true” shoe fits. We initially became interested in Hosa’s ability to produce operating margins far superior 


than its comps.  We noticed that Hosa’s cash conversion cycle lagged its purported profitability.  We noticed that 


despite generating positive net income, the Company relied on external cash from financing to pay its stock dividends. 





Desktop research revealed that Hosa transacts with multiple undisclosed related party distributors.  Credit Reports and 


SAIC filings for these distributors disclose that Hosa’s top distributors failed to generate the amount of revenues Hosa 


claimed, distributors failed to generate profits for themselves, and that certain distributors maintained large balances 


of receivables and payables we suspect are a result of fabricated transactions with Hosa.  Additionally, Hosa’s balance 


sheet has been swelling in categories of receivables, inventories, and short-term investments, all the while increasing 


its liabilities in the form of notes payable and debt.  





Then we found the share pledges.  Disclosures in Hosa’s 2017 Annual Report confirm that the Shi brother’s pledged 


shares to secure Hosa’s US$50 million loan in September 2017.1  Hong Kong Stock exchange disclosures from CMBC 


International Holdings and China Construction Bank reveal that as of April 17, 2018, the Shi brothers had pledged at 


least 231,153,120 shares2.  On July 10th, 2018, the Company disclosed that besides the 10.9 million shares sold by 


banks on June 29th that sent the stock down 87%, there are an additional 579 million shares still pledged TODAY 


as collateral for margin loans, roughly ~35% of the Company’s shares! 





As discussed in the following sections, we present publicly available evidence which suggests to us that Hosa 


fabricated its reported revenues to investors in its public filings.  As evidenced by Credit Reports and SAIC filings, 


we believe management lied about its purported profitability and used undisclosed related parties to artificially inflate 


its reported financial performance to raise money from unsuspecting minority shareholders. 





Coupled with trading manipulation and stock pledges, we believe that once the fraudulent scheme is understood by 


investors, Hosa’s will no longer have access to additional capital and Hosa management will face additional margin 


calls.  





As with other uninvestible ideas such as Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy, we believe Hosa’s equity will ultimately be 


worth zero.

INTRADAY TRADING PATTERNS INDICATE STOCK MANIPULATION 





We analyzed intraday trading patterns and found that the recent price appreciation and volume increase in Hosa’s 


stock since December 2017 is due to unusual gains posted in the final hour of trading.  We think that management 


purposely executed the last hour manipulation scheme to prop up Hosa’s daily closing price to secure additional short-


term financing and avoid margin calls on previously pledged shares. This creates a highly unstable situation where 


banks hold highly overvalued stock as collateral as evidenced by the 87% price decline on June 29, 2018.   





As share prices fall, we believe that the banks will be forced to sell the additional shares held as collateral to secure 


outstanding margin financing agreements. This will cause the share prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more 


pledged shares. In our opinion, this is the exact scenario which caused a sudden, dramatic collapse in the price of 


Hosa, Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy shares. 





a. Hosa’s Stock Price Rises Inexplicably in the Final Hour of Trading 
 


Bloomberg maintains intraday trading data for Hong Kong securities for the past 140 trading days. Evidence of 


manipulation can be found in intraday trading patterns, particularly the appreciation of a company’s stock in the last 


hour of trading.  





Gains throughout the trading day, over time, should be uniform, so we compared the returns generated from two 


different trading strategies. First, we calculated the returns if an investor simply purchased the shares on day 1 of the 


period and sold them at the end of the period. We refer to this as the buy-and-hold strategy. With the last-hour trading 


strategy, we modeled the compounded returns if, each day, an investor bought the subject stock at 3:00 pm (Hong 


Kong time), sold the stock an hour later at the close of the market, and then reinvested the proceeds in the same manner 


the following day. 





As is evident in the table below, for Hong Kong’s top 15 traded stocks on June 26th, 2018 (measured by highest 


average dollars traded), there is little difference in an investor’s returns between a buy-and-hold strategy versus a 


last-hour trading strategy.  This is what we would expect for non-manipulated stocks. Partial Investment period equates 


to partial return participation. Indeed, our analysis shows that investors were punished in 11 of 15 cases with lower 


returns for only trading the last hour, as opposed to buying and holding throughout the same period. 





In the period from December 12, 2017 through June 25, 2018, the median return for an investor who bought and held 


Hong Kong’s most actively traded stocks was 4.45%. A last-hour trading strategy for those same stocks would have 


generated a median return of -1.83%. 





Over the same period, a buy-and-hold strategy of Hosa’s stock would have generated a loss of 0.43%.  But if an 


investor bought Hosa’s stock at the beginning of the last trading hour and sold at the close of the trading day (and 


reinvested the proceeds the next day in the same manner), Hosa’s stock would have returned an inexplicable 76% over 


that same period!  


 
Source: Bloomberg Historical Intraday Trading Data for the Period December 12, 2017 through June 25, 2018 





This staggering difference is highly unusual when compared to other Hong Kong stocks, and in our opinion, strong 


evidence of manipulation.

Put another way, a last-hour trading strategy in Hosa’s stock generated 41x the amount of returns than the median 


return for the last-hour trading strategy of Hong Kong’s top 15 actively traded stocks. Just like with Hanergy and Tech 


Pro, we believe that this trading pattern of highly unusual gains in the final hour of trading is indicative of stock 


manipulation.

The two largest holders of Hosa stock are Mr. Shi Hongliu (Chairman) and his brother Mr. Shi Hongyan (collectively

On July 10, 2018, the Company’s announcement confirmed that 10.966 million shares were sold by the banks on June

As the collateral requirements are recalculated for the remaining 579 million pledged shares, we expect further 


downside to Hosa’s share price. 





The manipulation of pledged shares creates a highly unstable situation where banks hold highly overvalued stock as 


collateral.  If share prices fall, banks may be forced to sell the shares held as collateral to secure outstanding loans. 


This will cause the share prices to fall further, prompting banks to sell more pledged shares. In our opinion, this is the

REVENUE FABRICATION USING UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY DISTRIBUTORS 





Prior to its IPO in 2011, Hosa transitioned its business model from a direct sales model to a distributorship model.  In 


July 2010, Hosa disposed of its three internal distributors (now called Shanghai Xingchi, Guangzhou Yingchang, and 


Beijing Yasha) to supposed independent third parties.   





We believe that Shanghai Xingchi Apparel Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Xingchi”), Guangzhou Yingchang Apparel Co., Ltd. 


(“Guangzhou Yingchang”), and Beijing Yasha Apparel Co., Ltd. (“Beijing Yasha”) remain three of the top five largest 


distributors for Hosa.  


 
Source: Global Offering – p. 97, 101, 121 





SAIC Filings, Chinese court judgements and desktop research reveal that the Shi brothers currently retain undisclosed 


related party connections with multiple distributors, including Shanghai Xingchi and Guangzhou Yingchang, which 


we believe allows the Shi brothers to fabricate transactions using multiple secretly controlled customers and artificially 


inflate the financial performance Hosa reports in its public filings to investors. 





Since 2011, Hosa has purportedly generated approximately 50% of its total revenues from its five largest customers.  


As top 5 customers, we would expect to see average costs of goods sold (“COGS”) for each top 5 customers of RMB 


115 million and RMB 121 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  





 
Source: Company Annual Reports 





Credit Reports, available to any investor online, contain detailed financial statement information for Chinese 


companies.  Credit Reports for Hosa’s three primary distributors, Shanghai Xingchi, Guangzhou Yingchang, and 


Beijing Yasha, reveal significantly lower COGS and operating activity as compared to what Hosa claims to have sold 


to its top 5 customers in 2016 and 2017.   





Shanghai Xingchi’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 33 million and RMB 31 million in 2016 and 2017, 


suggesting that Hosa overstated sales to Shanghai Xingchi by at least3 243% and 289% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  





Guangzhou Yingchang’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 35 million in both 2016 and 2017, suggesting 


that Hosa overstated sales to Guangzhou Yingchang by 228% and 242% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  





Beijing Yasha’s Credit Report reveals that its COGS were RMB 62 million and RMB 26 million in 2016 and 2017, 


suggesting that Hosa overstated sales to Beijing Yasha by 85% and 372% in 2016 and 2017, respectively.  





                                                             
3 Shanghai Xingchi sells products other than Hosa.  For our calculations, giving benefit of the doubt to Hosa, we assume that all 


of Shanghai Xingchi’s COGS were purchases from Hosa.

We do not think Hosa’s revenue overstatement practices are isolated to only these three distributors.  As discussed in 


this report, multiple additional undisclosed related party transactions exist between Hosa and its distributors.  If we 


apply Hosa’s 2016 and 2017 overstated revenue percentage for its three primary distributors to its reported total 


revenues, we estimate Hosa fabricated revenues of RMB 685 million and RMB 894 million in 2016 and 2017 


respectively! 





We estimate that Hosa’s actual 2016 and 2017 total revenues were RMB 419 million and RMB 304 million, 


respectively, 32% of what Hosa reported to investors.

Contrary to what Hosa management said about sharing the wealth with its distributors, we found meaningful losses at 


the distributors we were able to identify. Credit Reports for these identified distributors, including Shanghai Xingchi, 


Beijing Yasha, Guangzhou Yingchang, Shanghai Bangbu and Jiashi Youpin for 2016 and 2017 show year over year 


revenue declines and negative to break even net income.

Oddly, in nearly every single distributor example we found shows revenues decline year over year while receivables, 


inventories and payables increase. We would expect to see large balances of receivables, inventories and payables if 


the distributors were helping Hosa to fabricate of transaction volumes.  





The distributor’s poor operating performance is corroborated by historical SAIC filing financial statement information.

Beyond fake receivables, inventories and payables, we suspect fabricated profits hide in Hosa’s opaque balance sheet 


line item of cash equivalent “fixed deposits” which was only introduced as a reported line item post IPO.  If “fixed 


deposits” are a catch-all bucket for fabricated profits, we believe it is possible that Hosa has been reporting fabricated 


sales and profits since 2012.  





 
Source: Hosa Annual Reports 





We believe that Hosa management has premeditatively constructed a fraudulent scheme to bilk unsuspecting creditors 


and minority shareholders out of their investments.  Using a web of undisclosed related party distributors and suppliers, 


we think management has been able to fabricate its purported revenues and profits.

a. Shanghai Xingchi 
 


During the track record period, Shanghai Xingchi accounted for 49% of Hosa’s sales.  To avoid further conflicts of 


interest post global offering, Hosa disposed of Shanghai Xingchi to claimed third parties and claimed that no further 


sales would be made to Shanghai Xingchi.

Not only is the evidence clear that Shanghai Xingchi is operating as a Hosa distributor, contrary to the director’s 


statements in Hosa’s global offering, but additional evidence suggests, in our opinion, that Shanghai Xingchi is still 


under Hosa’s control.  





Shanghai Xingchi’s 2014 and 2015 SAIC filings disclose that its registered address was 4F No. 150 Nanjing West 


Road, Shanghai, the same registered address of Chairman Shi’s private companies, Haosha (China) Co., Ltd. and 


Haosha (Shanghai) Textile Technology Co., Ltd. 





 
Source: http://www.gsxt.gov.cn/index.html 





Hosa’s 2017 Annual Report discloses that Chairman Shi Hongliu owns a private company, Haosha International 


(H.K.) Limited (“Haosha Intl.”).  SAIC filings reveal that Haosha Intl. is the sole shareholder of Haosha (China) Co. 


Ltd. (“Haosha China”) and Haosha Textile Technology (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. (“Haosha Shanghai”).  Both Haosha 


China and Haosha Shanghai’s 2015 SAIC filings disclose having the same address (4F No. 150 Nanjing West Road) 


as Shanghai Xingchi.

In 2016, all three entities coincidentally updated their addresses and phone numbers to match exactly. Shanghai 


Xingchi’s 2016 SAIC annual report showed that its address changed to Room 609, Ming Shen Center Building, 3131 


Kaixuan Road, Xuhui District, Shanghai and the contact number was changed to 021-54245282, the same exact

The fact that Hosa’s distributor would maintain the same registered address and phone number as multiple other 


private entities of Chairman Shi suggests to us that Shanghai Xingchi is not an independent third party.  Furthermore, 


we find it highly improbable that Shanghai Xingchi coincidentally updated its registered address and phone number 


in 2016 to the exact address and phone number of Chairman Shi’s private businesses without being under the control 


of Chairman Shi.  Such coincidences are so unlikely that we believe it is not a coincidence.

In 2018, Guangzhou Yingchang described itself in a recruitment advertisement that it is primarily engaged in the 


distribution of Hosa brand products.

On July 30, 2010, as part of the pre-IPO reorganization process, the Shi brothers disposed of their interests in 


Guangzhou Yingchang to supposed Independent Third Parties, Mr. Xu Liangang and Ms. Shi Qingli.

However, we believe that Mr. Xu Liangang is not an independent third party.  SAIC filings reveal that Xu Liangang 


maintains the same supervisor as Xu Zehui, a listed significant person4 in Hosa’s global offering as having “the same 


goal” and deep historical connections to the Shi brothers.

We believe that companies who share the same supervisor are related.  The supervisor overlap between a significant 


shareholder of Hosa and a supposed Independent Third Party should be deemend a connected transaction and is 


misleading to investors. 





c. Beijing Yasha 
 


We believe that Beijing Yasha is one of Hosa’s largest customers.  Not only does SAIC filings reveal that 2015 COGS 


are RMB 143 million, greater than the reported average revenues Hosa generated from its top three customers, but 


Beijing Yasha operates the flagship stores for the Water Cube brands on both Tmall.com and JD.com.

Hosa claims in its filings that its only meaningful related party transactions have been products and services supplied 


by Haosha Garments and minimal sales to Haosha Fitness Centers.  However we think this is a lie.   





According to the government website of Datian City, Fujian Haote Textile Technology Co., Ltd. (“Haote Textile”) is 


the construction entity for Hosa’s RMB 500 million Sports Culture Industry Park in Datian.  Banner advertisements 


at the site of the construction project disclose that Hosa is responsible for the project, yet at the same time lists the 


name of Shi Hongliu’s private business Haosa International as the project constructor!  How can three separate 


businesses all be interrelated with the project construction? If Hosa is advertized at the site as being responsible for 


the project, why does Hosa fails to mention the project exists in its public filings?

A photo at the construction site of Datian Sports Culture Industry Park discloses that Hosa is responsible for the 


project, yet at the same time lists the name of the Shi Brother’s private business Haosa International as the project 


constructor.  How can three separate businesses all be interrelated with the project construction, yet Hosa fails to 


mention the project exists in its public filings?

Translation: 


“Introduction to Haosha Vitality City Project 





Haosha Vitality City is being constructed by Haosha International (H.K.) Limited, a company listed 


on the Main Board of Hong Kong, with a planned investment amount of RMB 1 billion. This Project 


is located at Xiayangchu, Hongxing Village, Junxi Town, Datian County, with a flooer area of 65.6 


mu (equivalent to 43,733 m2) and a total contruction agrea of more than 160,000 m2, in addition, 


this project comes along with Datian’s first citizen fitnesss square with a flooer area of 6,000 m2 


and Datian’s only swimming center constructed at the national competition standard. The company 


strive to make the new east city of Datian a comprehensive urban area that includes fitness, 


swimming, entertainment, commerce service and high-end residence, with a theme of “Fitness, 


Vitality and Sports.” It is intended to be the new land mark of Datian and a name card of a mordern 


city.” 





We suspect that the confusion is because the Shi brothers are intermingling their private businesses with the public 


company at will without differentiating between their private and public business operations.  Another possibility is 


that the Shi brothers are using their public shareholdings in Hosa, or worse the balance sheet of Hosa, to secure 


financing for the project without disclosing the liability to investors. 





Whatever the reason, the evidence is clear that Hosa has not made its investors aware of the Datian project with Haote 


Textile, an undisclosed related party supplier.   





SAIC filings for Haote Textile reveal that Chengwu International is the sole shareholder of Haote Textile.

Unfortunately for the Shi Family secret, the millenial son posted videos and images from his engagement party and 


wedding online which helped us confirm Shi Family connections to Chengwu International.  At Shi Yiran’s wedding 


in May 2018, the patriarch of this family, Shi Chengwu, made donations to “Shi Chengwu Family Fund,” which is a 


charity fund named after him. From the picture of the wedding, we can see that Shi Hongyan, the CEO of Hosa 


International, is standing with Shi Chengwu while promoting multiple donations to the charity fund and the local 


village.5

The local media translated this “Shi Chengwu Family Fund” as “Haosha Group Shi Chengwu Family Fund,” which 


suggests that Haosha Group is the most important business of this Shi family, and provides the sources of funds for 


the charity fund.

Still images taken from Shi Yiran’s engagement ceremony video highlights the family connection between Shi 


Chengwu, Shi Yiran, Shi Hongliu and Shi Hongyan, further corroborating that Shi Chengwu and Shi Yiran are part 


of the Shi Family and should be disclosed as connected persons.

We think the connections are clear, that Shi Yiran and Shi Chengwu are connected persons to Hosa and the extent of 


their involvement in any companies that transact with the Hosa need to be disclosed.

Earlier in this report we made the connection that Shi Shaoteng was the primary shareholder of one of Hosa’s 


distributors, Jiashi Youpin, despite working with Hosa since 2007 and most recently being promoted to an executive 


president position at Hosa.  SAIC filings reveal that Shi Shaoteng operates an apparel manufacturing company, Fujian 


Jiate Apparel Weaving Co., Ltd (福建省佳特服装织造有限公司) (“Jiate Apparel”) along with another undisclosed 


related party, Mr. Shi Qinghuang6 (施清煌)) as his supervisor.

We’ve seen this before.  Fraudsters need help from undisclosed related parties to avoid additional scrutiny of its 


reported transactions between parties.  This is cleary another instance whereby Hosa management has failed to disclose 


the connectivity of its executive president to a suspected supplier.

VALUATION 





In this report we present publicly available evidence that suggests trading in Hosa’s stock is manipulated and that 


Hosa’s reported financial statements are fabricated.  In our opinion, the Shi brothers have used these mechanisms to 


raise money from the capital markets and siphon off funds through cash dividends, stock pledges, and undisclosed 


related party transactions to insiders.   





We suspect that Hosa has been consistently fabricating its financial performance since its IPO, and that these fake 


profits have been carried on its balance sheet and the balance sheets of undisclosed related party distributors and 


suppliers as accounts receivables, inventories, payables and fixed deposits.  As discussed in this report, we estimate 


Hosa fabricated revenues of RMB 685 million and RMB 894 million in 2016 and 2017, respectively, an 


overstatement of 217%! 





In our experience when management fabricates transaction volumes with the help of undisclosed related parties, we 


expect a large corrruption discount to the reported financial performance and a discount to the assets reported on its 


balance sheet. 





Coupled with trading manipulation and stock pledges, we believe that once the fraudulent scheme is understood by 


investors, Hosa’s will no longer have access to additional capital and Hosa management will face additional margin 


calls.  





As with other uninvestible ideas such as Tech Pro and Huishan Dairy, we believe Hosa’s equity will ultimately be 


worth zero.
