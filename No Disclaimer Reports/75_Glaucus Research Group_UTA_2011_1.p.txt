• UTA is fabricating its publicly filed financial statements. Its actual underlying business is far smaller 
than its SEC filings indicate.


• UTA’s business model is not credible. For example, UTA claims to have earned $110 million in net  
revenue  in  the  first  three  quarters  of  2010  on  an  advertising  budget  of  $247,449  in  the  highly 
competitive leisure  travel  market.  Its  competitors  spend five to  10 times more  on marketing as  a 
percentage of net revenue, casting doubt on the authenticity of UTA’s revenue and net income.


• UTA has a deficient and unpopular website, boasts only a minimal brick-and-mortar retail operation 
and has no kiosks under its control to directly sell to consumers. Yet the company’s return on assets 
and  asset  turnover  figures  suggest  it  is  the  most  efficient  company  in  the  leisure  travel  space, 
consistently trouncing the competition.


• UTA’s website is barely functional (as can be seen in our videos here, here, here, here and here), offers 
a terrible user experience and receives only a small fraction of the traffic of its Chinese competitors, 
despite the fact that the company holds itself out as an online travel service provider.


• UTA is a serial capital raiser, repeatedly returning to western investors for cash despite supposedly 
having, according to its balance sheet, ample cash on hand, which sits unused in an account earning .
36% in interest per year. UTA is lying about the amount of cash on its balance sheet, as is evidenced 
by its inexplicably low interest income.


• UTA  has  destroyed  shareholder  value  through  a  series  of  dilutive  acquisitions.  The  company’s 
acquisition targets had much smaller earnings than UTA claimed in its public filings.


• UTA’s purported relationship with Agoda, a subsidiary of Priceline.com, is overstated.


• UTA has burned through 4 low-quality auditors and 3 CFOs in 5 years.

In this report, we present compelling evidence that Universal Travel Group (“UTA” or the “company”) is  
falsifying its publicly filed financial statements.  We believe that UTA’s SEC financial statements greatly 
exaggerate the company’s revenue, cash balance and net income.  UTA is actually a tiny and antiquated  
brick-and-mortar travel business, and its management is lying about the size and sophistication of the  
business in order to misappropriate funds from investors. 


Introduction 


UTA, a travel services provider in the People’s Republic of China (“China”), offers hotel reservations, air 
ticket bookings and packaged tours services.  Like many other companies operating in China which have 
been accused of fraud, UTA went public via a reverse merger transaction in 2006.  


In September 2010, investors publicized compelling evidence of the non-functionality of UTA’s website 
and accused the company of fraud.  Up to that point, UTA had pitched itself as an online travel service 
provider akin to Orbitz (OWW), Expedia (EWW), Priceline (PCLN), cTrip (CTRP) and eLong (LONG).  
The following quote is taken directly from UTA’s SEC filings prior to the publication of evidence that the 
company’s website did not work: 


• “We aim to be the foremost leading online travel services provider in the People’s Republic of 
China,  especially  in  the  air  ticketing  service,  hotel  booking  and  packaged  tour  providing 
sectors.”1


Shortly after being accused of fraud, UTA’s management backtracked on an investor conference call and 
declared that only 2% of its air ticket and hotel bookings, and 0% of its package tour bookings were  
booked online through its website, and only 20% of its air ticket bookings, 30% of its hotel bookings and 
0% of its packaged tour bookings were “online related.”  This statement directly contradicted everything  
UTA had told shareholders and investors prior to the allegations of fraud.  In addition, by admitting that 
UTA generated very little business online, management backed itself into a corner: if UTA is not an  
online travel company, then how does it reach customers?  Consider the following: 


• UTA has a miniscule marketing budget to attract and retain customers.


• UTA’s website is barely functional and unpopular.  


• UTA has a limited number of, if any, brick-and-mortar retail outlets.  


• UTA has  no kiosks under its control through which the Company can sell airline tickets, hotel 
room or package tours.  In 2008, UTA made a big deal about its plan to deploy kiosks across  
China in order to market and sell its travel products directly to consumers.  UTA’s 10-K for the 
fiscal  year  2009  mentions  the  word  “kiosk”  35  times  and its  10-k  for  the  fiscal  year  2008 
mentions the word 28 times.  Then, on September 10, 2010, UTA sold all of its kiosks to an 
insurance product retailer which has no contractual obligation to permit UTA to use the kiosks to 
market and sell its products to consumers.2  


1  UTA Form 10-Q for  Q3 2009 , pg. 30
2  The Purchase and Sale Agreement between UTA’s subsidiary and the insurance product retailer gives UTA 


“exclusive travel product sales right in all kiosks for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date.” (Section 
9.2).  Note that the buyer, an insurance product retailer, has no obligation to offer any of UTA’s travel products 
at the kiosks.  The buyer merely cannot use the kiosks to sell travel products of another company.

http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2010/09/travelling-through-china-with-universal.html
This begs the question: how does UTA attract customers?  With a moribund internet presence, a tiny 
brick-and-mortar retail operation and no direct-to-consumer kiosk business under its control, we 
would expect a large advertising budget to attract customers to its call center.  UTA’s SEC filings  
show exactly the opposite.  


Marketing - Where’s the Beef? 


UTA’s marketing budget is not sufficient to realize the company’s purported revenue, suggesting that the  
company is falsifying its financial statements.   


UTA spent $191,2303 on marketing in 2009 yet claims to have earned $97 million in gross revenues for 
that year.  UTA spends an order of magnitude less on marketing than any other travel service provider in  
China or the United States, yet  achieves comparable revenue and net income, suggesting that UTA’s  
financial statements are fabricated.  


70% of UTA’s revenue is from leisure travel customers and only 30% is from business travel customers.  
Advertising might not be as critical in the business travel segment because corporate customers negotiate  
bulk purchases of airline tickets and hotel rooms, there are higher switching costs for companies with an 
established provider relationship, and companies are slightly less price-sensitive than retail consumers.  
By contrast, in the leisure travel market, low switching costs and high price sensitivity among travelers  
forces  both  online  and  brick-and-mortar  travel  service  retailers  to  establish  strong  brands  through 
aggressive  marketing  and  promotional  campaigns.   The  Chinese  leisure  travel  market  is  highly 
fragmented and ultra competitive, so we would expect UTA to devote a significant portion of revenue to 
marketing.  This is not the case.  


The table below compares UTA’s marketing expenses with its Chinese and American competitors:

The table above shows that compared to its competitors, UTA’s advertising budget is almost non-existent.  
In the first UTA column, we provided UTA’s reported marketing expenses.  But in case UTA somehow  
classifies  some  of  its  marketing expenses  under  “salary and commission,”  in  the  second column we 
provided an aggregate of UTA’s expenses for marketing, salary, commission and advertising.  In absolute 
terms, UTA’s marketing expenses are tiny compared with its nominal competitors.  The picture is just as 
bad when calculated as a percentage of net revenue:

2009 0.2% 3.5% 16.3% 35.1% 20.7% 34.8% 29.1%


2008 0.2% 4.2% 18.0% 46.9% 20.5% 37.6% 35.6%


Average 0.2% 4.2% 17.2% 41.0% 21.3% 36.2% 31.2%


The numbers  above are  staggering.   As we would expect,  larger  and more  established leisure  travel  
service providers such as CTRP and PCLN achieve economies of scale with respect to their operating 
expense structure.  By comparison, smaller firms such as LONG, EXPE, OWW and UTA, should be  
expected to spend an average of 30% to 40% of their net revenue on marketing.  


UTA is an extreme outlier, spending between 0.2% and 4.2% of net revenue on marketing.  Yet in a 
highly fragmented and competitive market  in which customers are very price sensitive and have low 
switching  costs,  UTA’s  revenues,  net  income,  gross  margins  and  operating  margins  seem  to  be  
unaffected.  


UTA’s Financials are Grossly Misstated


UTA’s Airline and Hotel Sales Are Not Credible


UTA’s website is highly deficient and unpopular and compared to its competitors, the company spends 
virtually nothing on marketing.  It has no meaningful kiosk or brick-and-mortar retail operations.  Yet the  
company reports spectacular financial results.  Compare UTA’s sales with its competitor, LONG, which 
boasts a functional and popular website and a marketing budget in line with industry expectations.


Sales Figures v. Marketing Costs UTA LONG


2009: # of airline tickets sold       2,360,000           2,205,000 


2009: # of hotels booked       2,349,000          4,316,000 
2009: Advertising Costs $       191,230  $      19,513,243 
2008: # of airline tickets sold       1,720,000         1,788,000 
2008: # of hotels booked       1,466,000         3,945,000 
2008: Advertising Costs  $      148,903  $      23,872,737 


In 2009, UTA claims to have booked the same number of airline tickets and less than half the number of 
hotel rooms as LONG with one one-hundredth of LONG’s marketing budget.  In 2008, UTA claims to 
have booked the same number of airline tickets and 40% as many hotel rooms as LONG with less than  
0.8% of LONG’s marketing budget.  Take into account the fact that compared to LONG, UTA’s website  
is barely functional and does not receive a lot of traffic, and such numbers seem even more incredible.  


UTA sales in the airline ticket and hotel reservation segments  can be explained in one of two ways: 
either UTA is by far the most amazingly successful  marketer in the history of the retail  travel  
industry or UTA is completely fabricating its revenue and net income numbers.  


 4
UTA  ’s Gross Margins Are In Line With Competitors  
 
UTA’s gross margins are similar to those of its competitors, suggesting that UTA is accounting for COGS 
in a manner similar to its nominal peers, making the absence of significant marketing costs below-the-line  
even more absurd.  


In order to have an apples-to-apples comparison, we stripped out UTA’s package tour gross margins, 
which are much lower, and compared UTA’s gross margins on its hotel room and airline ticket sales with 
that of its competitors. 


Gross Margin
UTA (hotel and 


airline only)
CTRP LONG PCLN EXPE OWW


1st 9mo 2010 75.4% n/a n/a 60.8% 79.7% 80.1%
2009 76.9% 72.4% 66.1% 53.9% 79.5% 81.3%
2008 78.8% 72.7% 66.1% 50.7% 78.3% 81.3%


Average 77.0% 72.6% 66.1% 55.1% 79.1% 80.9%


Gross margins for online travel service providers are generally high, as such companies act as booking  
agents and thus carry very low inventory risk.  UTA’s gross margins on airline ticket and hotel bookings 
are in line with CTRP, EXPE and OWW, and well above LONG.  This suggests that UTA accounts for 
COGS in a manner similar to its purported competitors.  This makes the absence of any below-the-line 
marketing costs even more significant.    


To be long on UTA, an investor would have to believe that UTA found a magic formula by which it 
achieves  the  same gross  margins  as  its  competitors  without  a functional  or  popular website,  a 
limited kiosk and brick-and-mortar retail operation, and virtually non-existent marketing. 


Asset Turnover and ROA Numbers Are Similarly Incredible


UTA’s performance measured by asset turnover is also suspiciously spectacular when compared to its  
competitors. 


Asset Turnover UTA CTRP LONG PCLN EXPE OWW
1st 9mo 2010 100.7% n/a n/a 102.8% 38.9% 43.6%


2009 144.9% 62.5% 32.1% 148.6% 50.0% 51.2%
2008 165.9% 66.6% 30.0% 142.4% 41.4% 60.3%


Average 137.2% 64.6% 31.1% 131.3% 43.4% 51.7%


  
Business valuation 101 dictates that asset turnover is a proxy for a firm’s efficiency.   Judging by the 
above table, UTA is the best run company in the leisure travel services market.  UTA claims to be as 
efficient  as  a  $22  billion  company,  PCLN,  and  substantially  more  efficient  than  each  competitor 
mentioned above, including its Chinese rivals, CTRP and LONG.  How can UTA generate so much 
revenue off its assets while hobbled with a terrible website, a tiny brick-and-mortar retail operation 
and a minimal marketing budget?  Either UTA has found a way to squeeze more from its assets than 
incredibly sophisticated, established and successful companies, or UTA is lying.  


 5
UTA’s purported returns on its assets are similarly contrived, apparently placing UTA in line with 
industry leaders CTRP and PCLN.


Return on Assets UTA CTRP LONG PCLN EXPE OWW
1st 9mo 2010 16.1% n/a n/a 17.1% 5.4% 1.5%


2009 15.9% 19.4% 1.7% 31.1% 5.1% n/a
2008 36.6% 18.6% n/a 14.0% 6.7% 0.1%


UTA’s  seemingly  magnificent  performance  despite  the  discrepancy  in  its  marketing  expenses  also  
illustrates a larger point.   It is not easy to fabricate SEC financial statements.  Given the turnover in  
auditors and chief financial officers, as we discuss in greater detail below, it probably takes considerable 
effort for UTA to get all of its lies straight.  When a company fabricates numbers, it misses little details,  
like making sure its advertising budget matches that of other companies in the industry, or insuring that 
the company’s interest income matches the amount of cash the company claims to possess.    


UTA’s Website is Highly Deficient 


UTA’s website is barely functional: it is riddled with dead ends and broken links, it offers a terrible  
user experience, and it sells airline tickets and hotel rooms for a substantially greater price than  
offered on the websites of its competitors.  


Glaucus Research Group urges readers to view each of the following videos demonstrating the failure of 
UTA’s website to serve retail travel customers.  


In our first video, which can be accessed here, we are unable to complete the purchase of an international 
airline ticket on UTA’s Chinese website, cnutg.com.  In our second video, which can be accessed here, 
we are unable to complete the purchase of an international hotel room on UTA’s Chinese website.  


In our third video, which can be accessed  here, we attempt to purchase a hotel room in Shenzhen on 
UTA’s Chinese website.  The website displays no pictures of the hotel, there is no interactive map and 
there are no reviews.  Compared to the website of UTA’s competitor, LONG, which boasts an array of  
pictures, an interactive map and fulsome reviews and comments, UTA’s website offers a terrible user  
experience.  


In our fourth video, which can be accessed here, we attempt to purchase an airline ticket from Shenzhen 
to Xian.  UTA’s website offers the same tickets for  a substantially higher price than its competitors, 
CTRP and LONG.  UTA caters to leisure travelers, a segment of customers who are extremely price  
sensitive.  This video also shows that other popular Chinese travel search aggregators (Chinese versions 
of Kayak.com) and competitor websites offer exactly the same product at a much lower price.  


In  our  fifth  video,  which can be accessed  here,  we  show that  the  award-winning website  of  UTA’s 
subsidiary, Shanghai Lanbao Service Company Limited (“SLB”), also offers a terrible user experience  
vis-à-vis  UTA’s  competitors.   Given  UTA’s  highly  deficient  website,  it  is  highly  unlikely  that  the  
company is able to compete with CTRP and LONG for online travel customers.  But this should be old 
news.

UTA’s Website Traffic is Anemic 


Independent research shows that UTA’s website is unpopular, as we would expect from a website that  
presents such a terrible user experience. 


According to chinarank.org.cn (“China Rank”), UTA’s website is not ranked in the top 100 websites in  
China for travel service providers.  China Rank is a trusted source of website rankings within the PRC 
and  is  hosted  by  the  Internet  Society  of  China,  a  government  organization  under  the  Ministry  of  
Information.


This  poor ranking is  corroborated by numerous independent  sources.   CR-Nielsen,  the Chinese joint  
venture of the international  market  research firm Nielsen,  released a  study ranking the top 15 travel 
websites in China:


1. www.ctrip.com   
2. www.elong.com   
3. www.lotour.com  
4. www.17u.com  
5. www.travelsohu.com  
6. www.houchepiao.com   
7. www.daodao.com   
8. www.huoche.com  
9. www.51766.com  
10. www.csair.com  
11. www.9tour.com  
12. www.yododo.com  
13. www.travelsky.com  
14. www.tourunion.com  
15. www.go2map.com  


UTA’s website did not make the cut, although UTA’s purported competitors, CTRP and LONG, took first  
and second place.  


More detailed comparisons show the same deficiency.  Below is an English translation of a comparative 
search of Chinese websites, ranked according to the number of unique visitors per day during the past six  
months.  Baidu.com, as expected, is number one.  CTRP and LONG come in a respectable, 119 and 678,  
respectively, in the rankings for the previous seven days.  UTA’s Chinese website, cnutg.com, is ranked  
25,977 for the seven days prior the date of the comparison, February 26, 2011.   The average ranking of  
UTA’s website for the previous 90 days is an atrocious  359,587, perhaps indicating that UTA’s more 
recent numbers are artificially inflated by the travel requirements of the Chinese New Year celebration.  
UTA’s website traffic is the extreme outlier represented by the blue line in the graph below.

The unpopularity of UTA’s website is just as evident when comparing the number of unique visitors to 
UTA’s website against the number of unique visitors to the websites of its competitors.  Below is an  
English translation of a comparison of the average number of unique visitors per million people that 
visited the applicable website in the past six months.  CTRP attracted an impressive 3,277 unique visitors 
per  million  during  the  previous  seven  days.   The  websites  of  LONG  and  two  English  language 
competitors, qunar.com and travelsky.com, attracted between 679 and 656 unique visitors per million  
people  during the same period.   By comparison,  UTA’s  Chinese website,  cnutg.com,  lured only 10 
unique visitors  per million people  during the previous seven days and an average of  3  unique 
visitors per million over the previous 90 days.  


 8
UTA’s performance is the extreme outlier presented by the blue line in the graph above.  Again, the 90-
day average is even more foreboding to investors.    


The  comparisons  above,  using  publicly  available  data,  show  that  UTA’s  website  is  deeply 
unpopular, which we would expect given its non-functionality.

UTA is Lying about the Amount of Cash on its Balance Sheet  


As of the end of the third quarter of 2010, UTA purportedly had $56.6 million in cash on its balance  
sheet.  On UTA’s investor conference call discussing the Q3 2010 results, management claimed that UTA 
earned interest on its cash at a rate .36% per annum.  If this is true, then UTA should have earned more in 
interest income for the given time periods, as shown on the following chart.


Cash Balance Analysis Q3'10 Q2'10 Q1'10 Q4'09 Q3'09 Q2'09 Q1'09
Claimed Interest Income - .36% per annum 0.09% 0.09% 0.09% 0.09% 0.09% 0.09% 0.09%
Expected Claimed Nominal Interest Income 50,998$   39,232$   34,050$   33,010$   21,143$   16,549$   17,254$   
Actual Reported Interest Income 17,723$   17,081$   23,631$   18,918$   15,909$   12,358$   10,939$   
Discrepancy 33,275$   22,151$   10,419$   14,092$   5,234$     4,191$     6,315$     


Overstatement of Cash Balance 188% 130% 44% 74% 33% 34% 58%


This chart demonstrates that UTA’s reported interest income is much lower than it should be.  We believe 
that the reason for the discrepancy is that UTA is currently lying about the amount of cash on its balance 
sheet.   If  we calculate the cash balance from the actual  interest  income reported in UTA’s  financial  
statements,  we believe  that  UTA  had less  than  $20  million  in  cash  on  the  balance  sheet  as  of 
September 30, 2010, when it told investors that it had over $56 million.   Circumstantial evidence 
supports this conclusion.  


UTA is a serial capital raiser, repeatedly returning to western investors for cash despite the fact  
that, according to UTA’s balance sheet, it has ample cash on hand, which sits unused in an account 
earning .36% in interest per year.  


On August 28, 2008, UTA consummated a private placement deal, selling common stock and warrants to  
purchase common stock to nine institutional investors for an aggregate purchase price of $7.1 million. 
Just two months earlier, as of June 30, 2008, UTA had $5.4 million in cash on its balance sheet.  UTA did  
not  engage in any acquisitions following the 2008 issuance.   Why would UTA raise capital  when it 
purportedly had sufficient cash? 


Management will probably protest that it wanted to increase UTA’s cash balance in the hopes of making  
future acquisitions or to build a war chest for leaner times.  The problem with this explanation is that  
according to UTA’s financials, UTA’s business practically mints cash.  


Here is where the story gets suspicious.  On December 15, 2009, UTA again went to the market to raise 
$20 million,  purportedly to fund acquisitions and working capital.   But  according to UTA’s balance 
sheet, as of September 30, 2009, the company had $23.5 million in cash.  Following the capital raise,  
UTA announced that it intended to acquire five companies for $21 million in cash.4  


Remarkably,  UTA returned  to  the  market  again  on  June  21,  2010,  issuing  2,857,143  shares  of  the  
common stock for a purchase price of $7.00 per share and an aggregate purchase consideration of  $19 
million.  UTA’s cash balance as of March 31, 2010 was almost $39 million. 


On  UTA’s  Q2  2010  earnings  call,  an  investor  confronted  UTA’s  management  with  the  following  
question: why would UTA continue to dilute shareholders when it purportedly had sufficient cash on the 


4  Following the capital raise, UTA acquired Huanghshan Holiday Travel Service Co., Ltd. (“HHT”) for $2.9 
million ($2.3 million in cash), Kunming Business Travel Agency Co., Ltd (“KTB”) for $5.7 million, Shanxi 
Jinyang Travel Agency Co., Ltd. (“SJT”) for $2.3 million, Zhengzhou Yulongkang Travel Agency Co. Ltd 
(“ZYT”) for $5.7 million and Hebei Travel Agency Co. Ltd (“HTT”) for $4.4 million ($3.5 million in cash).   


 10
balance sheet?5  Management answered that it needed the cash to grow the company in a competitive  
market.  This would make sense if management actually spent the capital it raised in order to facilitate  
growth.  But instead, the cash supposedly sits in an account earning .36% per annum.  


The chart below shows that UTA repeatedly raised capital when it had ample cash on its balance sheet.


Date # Shares Price Per Share Total Raised
Cash on the balance sheet at the 


end of the previous quarter
21-Jun-10 2,857,143 $7.00 $18,768,054.00 $37,833,072
15-Dec-09 2,222,222 $9.00 $19,999,998.00 $23,492,115
28-Aug-08 1,529,569 $4.65 $7,112,500.00 $5,489,737


$45,880,552.00


  
One such instance may not raise eye brows.  But why would UTA repeatedly return to the market to 
dilute shareholders when the company not only had ample cash on the balance sheet but was also 
generating cash from its organic business?  We suspect that, in fact, UTA has been lying about its  
cash balance.   


Other circumstantial evidence supports the conclusion that UTA has grossly exaggerated its cash balance.  
Despite repeated requests from shareholders, the company has never issued a dividend.  In addition, the 
company has never bought back its shares, a sensible use for cash that purportedly gathers dust.   In 
reality, UTA’s cash balance is probably much lower than it claims.  


UTA Engaged in Suspect and Dilutive Acquisitions


Dilutive Acquisitions


In both 2010 and 2007, UTA binged on dilutive acquisitions.  The trouble is that UTA’s targets earned far 
less  than  UTA claimed  in  the  company’s  publicly  filed  financial  statements.   We  obtained  income  
statements  from China’s State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) showing the pre-
acquisition revenue and net income of targets that UTA acquired in 2010 and 2007.  


The chart on the next page shows that UTA paid between 134x to 4228x net income during its acquisition 
rampage.  Across the board, UTA’s target companies earned far less at the time of acquisition than UTA 
claimed in its public filings.

The pre-acquisition net income and revenue of UTA’s acquisition targets are nowhere near 
what the company claimed them to be.  UTA is either wasting money or self-dealing.


There has been much debate recently about the validity of SAIC filings.  The SAIC is a government 
agency which, among other functions, issues business licenses to Chinese firms.  In order to obtain and  
renew a business license, which is required to operate in China, a Chinese company must file an annual  
inspection report containing a balance sheet and an income statement.  


Brokers  pumping small  cap Chinese stocks often argue that  SAIC filings  do not  match  SEC filings 
because the SAIC is  a  business  registrar  and it  does  not  review the accuracy of  submitted financial  
statements.  This makes no sense.  Why would a government agency ask a company to submit a balance  
sheet or income statement and then not care if it is blatantly false? More importantly,  what would a 
company gain by lying on financial statements submitted to the SAIC?  Some small cap brokers have 
argued that Chinese companies understate revenue in SAIC filings so as to avoid the attention of corrupt  
government officials.  This argument is weak.  Nothing should attract more attention from potentially 
corrupt  government  officials  than  raising tens  of  millions of  dollars  in  cash in American  capital 
markets.  Regardless, why are investors comfortable with a company that lies on any financial statement  
filed with any governmental agency, in the U.S. or China?  


Western investors defending the discrepancy between financial statements filed with the SAIC and those  
filed with the SEC should consider the following decision box:


 12
Decision Upside Downside


UTA lies  on  financial 
statements  filed with the

UTA lies on financial 
statements filed with the 
SEC


Millions of dollars from 
investors looking to China.


None. Neither the SEC nor the US 
government has jurisdiction over UTA, 
its officers or directors.


 
Whereas for a Chinese company there is a large upside and a limited downside to lying to the SEC, there 
is  by comparison no upside and a potentially large downside to lying to the SAIC.  So if there is a  
discrepancy between SEC and SAIC filings, it is more likely that the SEC filings are false.  Empirical 
evidence  supports  our  logical  reasoning:  there  are  many  examples  of  legitimate  companies  that  file 
accurate financial statements with the SAIC. 


Based on SAIC filings, UTA paid far too much for its 2010 and 2007 acquisitions, wasting 
shareholder money. 


Speedy Dragon


In two years, UTA managed to buy a business for $4 million, paying 75% in cash, and sell it back to the 
previous  owner  at  a  deep  discount.   UTA’s  management  is  either  misappropriating  money  through 
acquisitions or it is incompetent.  


On April 10, 2007, UTA acquired Shenzhen Speedy Dragon Enterprise Limited ("SSD") in exchange for 
238,095 shares of UTA common stock and $3 million in cash.  On June 12, 2009, the company entered 
into a termination agreement with Xiangsheng Song, the previous owner of SSD, to return the company 
to Mr. Song.  In exchange, Mr. Song (i) returned the 238,095 shares of UTA’s common stock back to 
UTA for cancellation and (ii) agreed to pay UTA in cash $500,000 by June 10, 2010.6


The business deal would be bad enough, but UTA then lied about the arrangement in its SEC filings.  In  
its Form 10-Q for Q3 FY 2010, UTA claimed that Mr. Song was required to return $2.8 million in cash to 
UTA as part of the termination.7  This is false.  The Agreement of Contract Termination, filed with the 
SEC, states that Mr. Song must only return $500,000 in cash by June 30, 2010.  It is not clear whether 
UTA simply lied to make the transaction look less like a disaster or management misread a one-page  
contract.  Alternatively, UTA may have a secret side deal with Mr. Song that it did not disclose to the  
SEC.  Pick your poison.  


Furthermore, according to the Agreement of Contract Termination, Mr. Song was obligated to return 
$500,000 by June 30, 2010.  But UTA’s 10-Q for the quarter ending September 30, 2010, stated that Mr. 
Song had not yet returned the cash.  Can UTA enforce the agreement? Does it have any intent to recover 
the money from Mr. Song? 


The Speedy Dragon episode is an example of either fraud or idiocy.   Neither should engender much 
investor confidence.

UTA’s Auditors: Who Watches the Watchman?


UTA cannot escape the stink of high turnover among low-quality auditors, churning through 4 in 5 years.8 


Dates Name Notes
October  5,  2010  – 
Present


Windes & McClaughry Accountancy 
Corporation (“Windes”)


Not a top 100 accounting firm and no 
offices or accountants in China.

30, 2009


Morgenstern, Svoboda & Baer, CFAs 
(“MSB”)


A 2009 PCAOB report  concluded that 
MSB’s  system  of  quality  control  for 
detecting fraud was inadequate.   


Formation - June 23, 
2006


Moore  and  Moore  &  Associates, 
Chartered (“MMA”)


In August 2009 the SEC charged MMA 
with  securities  fraud  for  issuing  false 
audit  reports  that  were  compiled  by 
auditors  with  only  a  high  school 
education and  with  little  or  no 
accounting or auditing experience.  


Burning through 4 auditors in 5 years is not reassuring, but the details make UTA look even worse.  The 
SEC charged its first auditor, MMA, with securities fraud for issuing false audit reports and compiling 
audit reports with auditors who did not even have college degrees. 


The  Public  Company  Accounting  Oversight  Board  (“PCAOB”)  reprimanded  its  second  and  longest  
serving auditor, MSB, for inadequate quality controls with respect to fraud.  The PCAOB’s report on 
MSB stated:


The Firm's system of quality control appears not to provide sufficient assurance 
that the Firm will perform all required procedures in accordance with the provisions  
of AU 316, Consideration of Fraud in a Financial Statement Audit. Specifically, the 
Firm  did  not  perform  audit  procedures  to  test  journal  entries  and  other 
adjustments for evidence of possible material misstatements due to fraud, and 
other than sign offs on an audit program and notations on a fraud risk information  
form,  there was no evidence in the audit  documentation,  and no persuasive other 
evidence, that the Firm inquired of management and the audit committee, or others 
with  equivalent  authority  and  responsibility,  as  to  their  views  about  the  risk  of 
material  misstatement  due  to  fraud,  or  conducted  a  brainstorming  session  with 
members of the engagement team. 


Any investor putting faith in UTA’s auditors as a bulwark against our findings should consider that the 
PCAOB publicly chastised MSB for rubber stamping financials and not doing diligence to minimize the  
risk of fraud.  Even such lax oversight was apparently not enough, because MSB and UTA parted ways.  
Then, UTA abruptly fired its third auditor.  UTA’s fourth auditor quit a month after retention.

UTA’s fifth auditor in five years is Windes.  Although Windes has yet to sign off on an audited financial  
statement,  investors  should be cautious  as it  shares  many of  the same characteristics as UTA’s  past  
accountants.   Like UTA’s four previous auditors,  Windes is not  considered  in the top 100 of public 
company accounting firms and has no offices in China.   Rather, Windes claims on its website that it uses 
Chinese auditors from the Baker Tilly network to conduct diligence of companies like UTA in China.  
This is problematic.  


Chinese auditors from the Baker Tilly network are not regulated by the PCAOB.  Without a legitimate  
American regulatory authority with dominion over their operations, Chinese auditors, under pressure to 
please clients, often refrain from a deep diligence dive, ignore suspicious numbers, and make favorable  
assumptions on their clients’ behalf.  In short, without the risk of censure or punishment, given that they 
do not answer to any U.S. regulatory body, the carrot of substantial fees leads local Chinese auditors to 
prioritize client retention over accurate disclosure and a thorough investigation.   


Revolving Door of Chief Financial Officers


UTA does not currently have, and has not had a Chief Financial Officer since August 17, 2010.  The  
history of turnover at this position is disturbing.  


Dates Tenure Name
Current “Interim” CFO 6 months Jing Xie
August 17, 2009 - August 17, 2010 1 year Yizhao Zhang
February 17, 2009 - August 17, 2009 6 months Jing Xie serving his first term.
July 12, 2006 - February 16, 2009 21/2 years Xin Zhang


A recent study of public company accounting fraud shows that, in the three years prior to the discovery of 
fraud,  companies  manipulating  financial  statements  experienced  higher  CFO  turnover  than  non-
manipulating firms.9  The study suggests that turnover is high at fraudulent companies because CFOs who 
refuse to bury their head in the sand either leave or are fired.  The glove fits in UTA’s case.  UTA’s CFO 
turnover has been very high.  It has not had the same CFO for consecutive audit cycles in over three  
years.  Given the mountain of evidence that UTA is engaging in a massive fraud, CFO turnover should 
eviscerate any remaining investor confidence in UTA’s published financials.  


9  “Why Do CFOs Become Involved in Material Accounting Manipulations?” is forthcoming in the Journal of Accounting and 
Economics.  It is the work of Weili Ge and Terry Shevlin of the University of Washington Foster School of Business, and Mei Feng and 
Shuqing Luo of the University of Pittsburgh Katz Graduate School of Business.

Partnership with Agoda


In July 2010, UTA announced a “partnership” with Agoda, a subsidiary of Priceline.com.  We are not 
disputing that such a “partnership” exists, but we doubt that the relationship is meaningful.  


According to UTA’s Form 10-Q for Q3 2010, the purpose of the partnership with Agoda was to enable 
UTA’s  customers  “through  [UTA’s]  website,  [to]  enjoy  special  Agoda  promotions  and  instant 
confirmation  at  tens  of  thousands  of  hotels  worldwide.  Specifically,  while  conducting  a  search  of 
international  hotels  on  [UTA’s]  website,  the  results  will  yield  supply  information  from  Agoda’s  
database.”  Empirical evidence refutes UTA’s far-fetched claims of integration.   


In reality, Agoda and UTA seem to have no overlap in either inventory or booking options.  In this video, 
watch as we try and book a hotel room in New York on UTA’s dysfunctional Chinese website.  Not only 
are we halted by a “booking failed” prompt every time we attempt to book a hotel,  but UTA’s 
Chinese website does not even display the prices of hotel rooms .  By comparison, on Agoda’s website, 
this video     shows that the transaction is seamless.  


In this video, watch as we try and book a hotel room in Shenzhen, the location of UTA’s headquarters, 
using both Agoda.com and UTA’s Chinese website.   Given that Agoda, a hotel reservation company 
headquartered in Southeast Asia, partnered with UTA in order to gain a foothold in China, we would 
expect  Agoda to either link to UTA’s website or at  least  offer  similar  products and prices.   Not so.  
Unbelievably, the price on UTA’s website is  almost 30% higher than Agoda’s website for the exact 
same hotel booking in Shenzhen.  This should be embarrassing to UTA, as Agoda seems to have a much  
stronger  relationship  with  suppliers  of  hotel  rooms  in  UTA’s  primary  market.   Moreover,  whereas  
Agoda’s website offers a detailed description and a number of pictures of the hotel in question, UTA’s  
Chinese website offers one picture of the outside of the hotel which appears to be cut in half on the  
screen.  


Further, there is evidence that UTA exaggerated the benefits of the purported partnership.  On UTA’s Q2 
2010 conference call, management announced that even though the relationship was in its infancy, the 
“partnership  has  been  giving  us  a  new revenue  stream to  improve  our  customer  usage  [for]  online  
bookings.”10  An auspicious beginning, no doubt.  However, on the company’s Q3 2010 conference call,  
management backtracked, claiming that although UTA now had access to Agoda’s hotel inventory (over 
200,000 hotels worldwide),  the partnership had “come online” but  due to the “speed limit  … of the 
internet  in  China [UTA] had not  achieved as  high customer  satisfaction as  [management]  wishes.” 11 
Complaining about the speed limit of the internet should not engender much confidence in a firm that 
holds itself out as an internet company.  


Both  this  backtracking  and our  videos  suggest  that  UTA and Agoda  are  not  sharing  inventory,  not  
negotiating as a unit with any suppliers, and not even linking to each other’s websites.  In other words,  
there is no meaningful partnership between Agoda and UTA.  


Our guess is that like many investors, Priceline.com and Agoda were fooled by UTA’s slick con.  When it 
came time to actually work together, Agoda probably discovered what we already know: UTA’s main  
business purpose is to operate as a sophisticated stock scam, not a well-run internet travel business.  
UTA is Lying about the Number of Call Center Representatives

According  to  a  UTA  call  center  representative,  UTA  employs  only  30-40%  of  the  call  center 
representatives that it claims in its public filings.  


UTA claims to employ 500 call center representatives at three call centers, primarily out of its Shenzhen 
operating  center.   We  called  a  representative  in  UTA’s  Shenzhen  call  center  to  discuss  the  non-
functionality of the website.  She said that the Shenzhen call center only staffs 100 representatives during  
the day and roughly 12 representatives after business hours.  She said that there were only a handful of  
representatives at UTA’s other two locations.  


We also visited the primary call center in Shenzhen during business hours on a weekday and found it  
eerily quiet for an operation supposedly bustling with hundreds of representatives.  Note that we visited 
the call center in Shenzhen during the Chinese New Year celebration, the largest human migration on 
earth.   Call  centers operated by Chinese travel  service providers should experience extremely heavy 
traffic during this period as people migrate from the cities to their ancestral villages and towns.  Rather  
than the bustling and chaotic operation we expected, we found the call center to be serene and pastoral.


By  conservative  estimates,  based  on  our  visit  to  the  call  center  and  our  conversation  with  a  UTA 
employee,  we estimate that UTA employs 30%-40% of the call center representatives that UTA 
claims in its public filings.   


UTA’s Call Center – Not as Advertised


In addition to being much smaller than advertised, UTA’s call center is not open during the hours that the 
company claims, and the call center has functionality problems. First, UTA advertises on its website that  
its call  center  is open 24 hours. When we called the number,  after selecting a prompt  to speak to a  
representative in English, we were unable to connect to a call center representative.  Rather, we heard a  
recording urging customer to call back during regular business hours, from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., Monday 
through Friday.  


Second, UTA’s website invites prospective travelers to speak with a call center representative via Skype.  
This is ostensibly a cost effective and convenient way for internet users to connect with the company.  
The trouble is, the Skype Me function does not work.


We tried repeatedly to connect to a UTA call center representative via Skype without any success.  Every 
time we tried to contact UTA through Skype, the following error message came up: 


 17
UTA’s call center hours and the failure of the Skype function are more examples of what we found over  
and over again: a significant gulf between the claims made by management and the actual operations of 
the company. 


Giving Away Money or Possible Self-Dealing? 


In 2008, without any explanation, UTA advanced $400,000 in cash to an unrelated company to assist in  
the unrelated company’s business development.  It does not appear that this advance has anything to do 
with UTA’s business.  Nor does the recipient of this cash have any obligation to pay UTA back the  
money.  Otherwise, such an advance would be characterized as a loan.  Furthermore, UTA did not acquire 
any equity in the target for such an advance.  Otherwise, the value of such equity could be listed as an 
asset.  Rather it appears to be a naked gift of $400,000, raising the specter of self-dealing.  A mere drop of  
impropriety amid a sea of fraud, a $400,000 advance may not seem like a lot of cash unless investors  
consider that such a sum is over twice as large as UTA’s 2009 marketing expenses.

Relentless Self-Promotion


Despite the fact that UTA’s business generally appears to be a mixture of fraud and incompetence, UTA 
has engaged in a campaign of relentless self-promotion.  Although not evidence of fraud, a whistle-stop  
publicity tour certainly makes sense if you believe that UTA is a serial capital raiser organized to bilk  
investors out of their money. 


UTA has participated in the following conferences:


• September 2010 – New York - Rodman & Renshaw Annual Global Investment Conference
• May 2010 – New York - CCG China Rising Investment Conference 2010
• May 2010 – New York - 7th Annual Piper Jaffray China Growth Conference
• March 2010 – Beijing - Rodman & Renshaw Annual China Investment Conference
• January 2010 – New York - Cowen & Company 8th Annual Consumer Conference
• November 2009 – New York - Brean Murray, Carret & Co. China Growth Conference
• October 2009 – Miami Beach - Roth China Conference
• September 2009 – Beijing - Susquehanna’s 3rd Annual Beijing Management Summit
• June 2009 – New York - In what will probably be considered a low point for the fabled 


institution, UTA CEO Jenny Jiang rings the opening bell of the NYSE.


UTA’s relentless self-promotion raises another red flag.   With so much publicity,  the opportunity to  
invest in UTA is sure to have crossed the desks of many institutional investors.  With UTA’s return on  
assets, revenue and net income it appears to be the most fabulous bargain on Wall Street.  Yet UTA’s  
shares trade around 5x earnings.  Investors must ask themselves this question: what do other institutional  
investors know that I do not? The answer is readily accessible through a quick sanity check of UTA’s  
financial statements and a few minutes of web browsing.  


Valuation - Clipping UTA’s Wings


How do we appropriately value a business that is falsifying its financial statements?  UTA’s business is  
unlikely to be generating meaningful revenue or profit, given that its website is dysfunctional and does 
not receive a lot of traffic; it has a minimal brick-and-mortar and kiosk operation and the company spends  
virtually nothing on advertising.  We believe that UTA’s existing business, however small  in size, is  
much closer to a commodity business than management leads investors to believe and thus would not  
warrant a premium valuation.  


Furthermore, given that UTA’s management team is incompetent and intent on defrauding investors, we 
are skeptical that shareholders will ever realize value from whatever form of underlying business actually 
exists.  At best, we can attempt to value the company with what we believe is the cash actually on hand: 


$19,692,222 + $295, 383 (5 months of interest collected at a .36% per annum rate) = $19,987,605.


Dividing this cash balance by the number of common fully diluted shares outstanding of  19,898,235 
yields a valuation of ~$1.00 per share.

Conclusion - Ocean Front Property in Arizona


When viewed together,  the  cumulative  evidence that  UTA is  falsifying  its  SEC financial  statements 
should give pause to anyone looking at a “can’t miss” opportunity by owning UTA’s shares.  That UTA 
has duped investors and escaped the attention of regulators since going public in 2006 is staggering.  
UTA is actually a tiny and antiquated brick-and-mortar travel business, lying about size, sophistication  
and business model in order to misappropriate funds from western investors.  To review: 


• UTA is fabricating its publicly filed financial statements. Its actual underlying business is far  
smaller than its SEC filings indicate.


• UTA’s business model is not credible. For example, UTA claims to have earned $110 million in 
net revenue in the first three quarters of 2010 on an advertising budget of $247,449 in the highly 
competitive leisure travel market. Its competitors spend 5 to 10 times more on marketing as a  
percentage of net revenue, casting doubt on the authenticity of UTA’s revenue and net income.


• UTA  has  a  deficient  and  unpopular  website,  boasts  only  a  minimal  brick-and-mortar  retail  
operation, and has no kiosks under its control to directly sell to consumers. Yet the company’s  
return on assets and asset turnover figures suggest it is the most efficient company in the leisure  
travel space, consistently trouncing the competition.


• UTA’s website is barely functional and receives only a small fraction of the traffic of its Chinese  
competitors, despite the fact that the company holds itself out as an online travel service provider. 
Our videos can be seen here, here, here, here and here.


• UTA  is  a  serial  capital  raiser,  repeatedly  returning  to  western  investors  for  cash  despite 
supposedly having, according to its balance sheet, ample cash on hand, which sits unused in an  
account earning .36% in interest per year. UTA is lying about the amount of cash on its balance 
sheet, as is evidenced by its inexplicably low interest income.


• UTA has destroyed shareholder value through a series of dilutive acquisitions. The company’s 
acquisition targets had much smaller earnings than UTA claimed in its public filings.


• UTA’s purported relationship with Agoda, a subsidiary of Priceline.com, is overstated.


• UTA is on its 5th low-quality auditor and 4th CFO in 5 years.


• According to a UTA call center representative, UTA employs only 30%-40% of the call center  
representatives that it claims.


We therefore issue a strong sell rating on UTA’s publicly traded securities and urge the last investor to 
turn out the lights.
