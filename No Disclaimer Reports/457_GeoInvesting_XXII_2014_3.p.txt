22nd Century Group (XXII)
– GeoInvesting Responds to
XXII’s Rebuttal of August
26, 2014 Article
August 28, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary 


We offer a rebuttal to all four of XXII’s
counterarguments to our piece published Wednesday
(yesterday) morning.
Rather than worry about the nuanced arguments XXII
made in its rebuttal, we believe investors should be
more interested in what XXII management did not
address.
We stand by our research and original sourcing and
believe that XXII could be offering up even more
smoke in its rebuttal.
We continue to advise caution to shareholders who
are funding XXII’s $47M failure and lining executive’s
pockets


We disagree with the rebuttal by XXII’s management and
stand by the sourced facts in our original article. XXII
claims that the “misleading and inaccurate statements are
too numerous to address,” but we think if the four they
picked out to address are their best points, shareholders
should be extremely worried. Additionally, we will welcome
further rebuttal from XXII management, should they find it
necessary.

https://geoinvesting.com/geoinvesting-responds-to-xxiis-rebuttal-of-august-26-2014-article/ 2/12


Specifically, we respectfully offer the following rebuttal to
management’s four points released in Wednesday’s press
release (source 3):


1. XXII rebuttal statement:


“In fact, 22nd Century Group went public in
January 2011 with approximately 27 million
shares. Currently the Company has
approximately 59 million shares outstanding, not
the 108 million alleged by the author.”


Our response:


We note that the number of shares, as referred to as
“quadrupled” in the article counts the fully diluted amount
of shares as represented in our original chart in the article
– from 2010 to 6/30/14. Taking 2010 out of the equation,
as to comply with XXII’s rationale, we still note that in
XXII’s first 10-Q filing from January 2011, they list
17.3 million common shares outstanding (source 1).
From that date, the total share count has risen to over 69
million fully diluted (inclusive of warrants and options).


Further, the same filings note that there are no outstanding
warrants from the three months ending December 31,
2010. Again, we are referring to fully diluted share count in
22  Century’s first 10-Q filing from January 2011. While
the company is stating there were 27 million shares when
they went public, we again note that the January 2011
filing lists 17,356,590 outstanding common shares.

5/23/2018 22nd Century Group (XXII) - GeoInvesting Responds to XXII’s Rebuttal of August 26, 2014 Article | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/geoinvesting-responds-to-xxiis-rebuttal-of-august-26-2014-article/ 3/12


We make the point that the fully diluted share count, which
now stands at 69.0 million+ is four times the amount of
total shares listed in the company’s initial 2011 10-Q (4 *
17.3M = ~69.2M). Therefore, we believe our commentary
to be correct. If we were to use the next SEC filing form
10-Q from May of 2011, which lists 27 million common
shares outstanding, we would still point out that this
number has more than doubled in less than 3 short years
(common shares only). That means that shares bought at
$3.00 in 2011 would be worth less than $1.50 today at the
same market cap. We still consider this to be an alarming
amount of dilution, as a product of the company needing to
sell shares in order to fund itself.


Further, to address the point that we alleged there were
“108 million” shares outstanding, we would advise XXII to
take another look at our article, as we clearly note more
than once that our calculations date back to 2010 and
that the number “108” doesn’t appear in the entire text of
the article at any point.  We simply never say there are
108 million shares, we note the 69 million figure (fully
diluted) in our chart that corresponds with this section of
the article.


We believe that XXII took the 27M shares it alleges to have
had in January (despite the filing saying something
different) and multiplied that by four (27 * 4 = 108) to
come up with this figure and obfuscate the point we were
trying to make.


2. XXII rebuttal statement:


“The author asserts that 22nd Century is in
default of a license agreement with a major
university. This is patently false. Further, just
today, 22nd Century signed a new license
agreement with the same university that the

author falsely alleges that the Company is in
default with.”


Our response:


We stand by our analysis and the referenced letter from
NCSU to XXII which we sourced as our precedent in stating
that XXII owed NCSU certain monies and was supposed to
complete Phase III clinical trials for X-22 as part of that
agreement. If XXII can provide a publicly filed precedent
that governs this issue (that post-dates the referenced
letter), we would re-examine this statement.  Further, we
find it extremely serendipitous for XXII that they signed a
new license agreement on Wednesday, the same day our
piece was published. We encourage readers to think about
the interesting timing there.


3. XXII rebuttal statement:


“Contrary to the author’s assertions regarding
stock promotion and sales, officers and insiders
have never engaged in stock promotion and have
made minimal sales of 22nd Century Group
common stock; in fact, management and insiders
retain more than 95% of their Company common
stock. Collectively, officers of the Company
directly and beneficially own approximately 28%
of the total outstanding shares.”


Our response:


While we note that officers and insiders themselves may
not have personally engaged in stock promotion with
regard to XXII, we stand by all of our fully sourced claims
that the CEO had been targeted by the SEC for
manipulation in the past. We also stand by our claim that

https://geoinvesting.com/geoinvesting-responds-to-xxiis-rebuttal-of-august-26-2014-article/ 5/12


shares have been doled out for “investor relations” and
professional services – most of which we believe to be
promotional in nature. Further, while insiders may still
retain significant ownership of the company, we remind
shareholders that executive total compensation for officers
(via the company’s most recent proxy) of the company
ranges from $186k/year for the company’s CFO to Mr.
Pandolfino’s salary at an astonishing $687k/year. Mr.
Pandolfino is being paid $687K of shareholders’
money/stock and only has some patents, a failed X-22
clinical trial, a track record of menial non-sustained
revenue, and a $47M deficit to show for it. This stands in
stark contrast to Mr. Pandolfino’s rebuttal comment that he
has “devoted essentially his entire net worth” to XXII. It
would appear from filing disclosures he reaps a significant
income from XXII, as opposed to devoting his income to
XXII.


Additionally, we note items like the CEOCAST source that
states that CEOCAST was specifically being paid “fifteen
thousand dollars per month in cash and stock” by
XXII. Considering Mr. Pandolfino says himself that he was
at the helm of XXII during those days, we believe he or
one of his executives ultimately had to sign off on a check
for these funds. This sure looks like paying for promotion
to us.

4. XXII rebuttal statement:


“Contrary to the author’s assertions, 22nd
Century has never abandoned any of its
products. The Company is continuing its efforts
to develop X-22, a cigarette intended for use as
a prescription smoking cessation aid, and has an
active investigational new drug application with
the FDA. Various independent clinical studies

continue to validate the efficacy of the
Company’s products for harm reduction and
smoking cessation.”


Our response:


While we note that XXII alleges that independent clinical
studies continue, we stand by our research backed by the
company’s own public commentary on X-22 trials; which
we again will include here from the company’s last public
filing and which states clearly that the company has
“suspended sponsoring further X-22 clinical trials” (source
2):

Summary


We believe Mr. Sicignano’s statements at the end of the
company press release issued on Wednesday to be more of
the same from XXII; promises of future growth without
tangible sustained revenue to back it up. We believe
statements like “MSA Authorization is imminent” and
“hundreds of tobacco retailers have expressed interest in
carrying the Company’s super-premium RED SUN  brand”
are more of the same fluff; none of which has accounted to
meaningful sustained revenue in the past.


As we stated in our first article, we view the MSA
authorization as negligible. Again, we note that becoming a
signing member of the MSA is an optional choice for a
cigarette manufacturer and that there are a number of
smaller cigarette makers that opt out of the MSA to sell as
a “non-participating manufacturer” (“NPM”). So, we don’t
view it as a game changer, but it will likely make for
another nice press release.

https://geoinvesting.com/geoinvesting-responds-to-xxiis-rebuttal-of-august-26-2014-article/ 7/12


We would ask why Mr. Sicigniano failed to name any of the
“hundreds of tobacco retailers” that he’s referring to.
 Could we see 75 of those names?  50? Any?  Will they be
like Orion in Poland who has signed a letter of intent to
manufacture XXII’s product three months ago, yet doesn’t
appear to mention XXII or its products on its website
(Sources 5, 6)? Additionally, Mr. Sicignano’s statement
about “exploring important joint venture opportunities in
Asia” offers no names or material content.


We continue to reiterate that this company has an
accumulated deficit of $47M and that it has suffered losses
every year since it’s been a public company.


We also note that if the company was progressing in a
fashion beneficial to shareholders after three years, it
would have been able to post more than $16K in revenue
this past quarter. Again, we ask about filtered cigars. We
remind shareholders that we could not find the word
“cigar” in the 2013 10-K. Why is the company’s sole
revenue from the past quarter from a product that the
company hasn’t talked about? It’s numbers like these that
led us to our initial doubts about the company’s ability to
monetize going forward.


With regard to Mr. Pandolfino’s track record with the SEC,
while we acknowledge that his indiscretion was 23 years
ago, we would like to also note that Mr. Pandolfino was
accused by the FTC in 1999 as having violated the
provisions of the Federal Trade Commission Act (source 4).
The FTC stepped in when Mr. Pandolfino’s “Alternative
Cigarettes, Inc.” company appeared to be making false and
misleading claims, alluding to the fact that the company’s
cigarettes did not have the same carcinogens as smoking
normal cigarettes. The FTC, more interested in the truth,
filed this in its initial complaint:

Through the means described in Paragraph 5, respondents
have represented, expressly or by implication, that
smoking Pure and Glory cigarettes, because they contain
no additives, chemicals, flavorings or preservatives, is less
hazardous to a smoker’s health than smoking otherwise
comparable cigarettes that contain additives, chemicals,
flavorings or preservatives. Through the means described
in Paragraph 5, respondents have represented, expressly
or by implication, that they possessed and relied upon a
reasonable basis that substantiated the representation set
forth in Paragraph 6, at the time the representation was
made. In truth and in fact, respondents did not possess
and rely upon a reasonable basis that substantiated the
representation set forth in Paragraph 6, at the time the
representation was made. Among other reasons, the
smoke from Pure and Glory cigarettes, like the smoke from
all cigarettes, contains numerous carcinogens and toxins,
including tar and carbon monoxide. Therefore, the
representation set forth in Paragraph 7 was, and is, false
or misleading.


While we acknowledge that people can change their ways
with age, we continue to see this as a red flag.


We believe that if you have a checkered past, such as in
the case of Mr. Pandolfino, that you have an even greater
responsibility to the markets to not surround yourself with
entities who have a past of promotion (Crede Capital),
bank fraud (Michael Wachs), bankruptcy (Rodman &
Renshaw) and bribery (Joseph Anderson) (source 7).


It is our mindset that being a public company is a
privilege; in the private sector you can’t post losses
every year since inception and pay yourself
$680k/year because you can’t simply go to the market
and sell stock whenever you need more money. The private
sector necessitates results in order to continue growth, but
the public markets offer a unique option of acting non-

profitably while continuing to line the pockets of insiders
and Board members. That liability is transferred onto the
common shareholders, generally. Part of the fiduciary duty
that comes with that privilege is being transparent,
disclosing everything the market should need to know, and
working in the shareholders’ best interests. We do not
believe XXII executives have acted in this fashion at all.


If you are long XXII, we would inquire as to whether or not
we disclosed items that you didn’t know about the
company. If we did, and something gave you pause, we’d
suggest you inquire with the company as to why this
information wasn’t as readily available as we’ve made it.


We reached out to IR on Tuesday of this week to see if we
could get some answers to questions that we had. IR failed
to comment on any of the three main questions that we
had, and we felt as if we were rushed off of the phone. IR
did, however, return an e-mail Wednesday afternoon to us,
letting us know that they could not comment on our
question about the what the additional BAT milestones are
(which still hasn’t been publicly disclosed) and confirming
that the company had shipped the 450,000 packs
mentioned in its April 2013 press release.


With regard to XXII claiming that we are here to “dupe and
scare investors into selling”, we would counter by stating
that our intention is only to bring the truth to light from a
realistic standpoint, as much as company insiders may not
want to face the reality of the $47M hole they’ve dug
themselves into since becoming a public company.


Rather than opine on these small technicalities in which
XXII tried to make an argument out of in its response, we
believe that shareholders would be much better served
reiterating these questions to themselves:

Do I want to invest in a company where the CEO has
been charged with manipulating stock by the SEC and
“false and misleading” claims by the FTC – at any
point in his life?
Why has the company lost so much money (to the
tune of $47M) since it’s been a public company?
Why hasn’t the company offered clear guidance as to
when they hope to turn a profit?
Why have none of the “big things” offered up by the
company panned out as of yet?
Why has the total, fully diluted share count since
the company’s filing in January 2011, quadrupled?
When is the next dilutive financing coming?


We continue to urge caution to XXII shareholders.
