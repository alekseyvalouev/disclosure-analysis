Biographical Note regarding Sean Passino, Esq.,
Ph.D., of Lowe Hauptman & Ham, LLP


Posted on September 12, 2013 by asensio.com


Thursday, September 12, 2013.    Sean Passino, Esq., Ph.D., is the


lead author of the Third Party Observations filed with the European


Patent Office on August 16th. Dr. Passino completed a Ph.D. in


chemistry at the University of Chicago and a juris doctorate at


Georgetown University. He is a registered patent attorney at the U.S.


Patent & Trademark Office. Dr. Passino has laboratory and research


experience that are directly relevant to the evaluating


experimentation with organometallic compounds that emit light via


phosphorescence.


Dr. Passino gained this experience working under Dr. Graham R.


Fleming, who is currently the Vice Chancellor for Research at the


University of California and Professor of Chemistry at UC Berkeley,


and who was Dr. Passino’s Ph.D. advisor. Dr. Fleming is widely


considered to be one of the world’s foremost authorities on ultrafast


processes and is responsible for developing many of the tools in


modern theoretical modeling of photochemical processes. Dr.


Fleming’s cutting edge work with ultrafast chemical processes from


the 1970s enabled an understanding of processes like


phosphorescence at the most fundamental level. Dr. Fleming is the


author of the book Chemical Applications of Ultrafast Spectroscopy,


published in 1986. Dr. Passino’s Ph.D. research also focused on


ultrafast processes and the study of molecular motions with laser


technology and non-linear optical experiments that probed protein,


glass, and liquid dynamics. This experience allows Dr. Passino to


understand experiments involving phosphorescent, organometallic


compounds and to evaluate choices of compounds and device


architecture in an OLED.
