Why Wayfair Is My Largest Short Position

Summary


In an article on its web site yesterday, the New York Times revealed that Wayfair
was, until very recently, likely selling toxic, formaldehyde-drenched Chinese-made
laminate flooring to at least a handful of customers.


The formaldehyde problem, by itself, isn’t a major issue; rather, it’s compelling
evidence to me of Wayfair’s gross incompetence and/or a business that’s completely
out of control.


I am also short Wayfair because it has one of the worst business models I’ve ever
seen. Competing head-to-head vs. Amazon, Home Depot, Target, Williams-Sonoma,
etc., I think the company’s odds of ever reaching breakeven, much less earning a
profit, much less earning enough of a profit to justify a $4 billion market cap are
close to zero.


I predict that Wayfair’s stock will be below $10 within a year.


The New York Times has broken a story I’m involved with that major U.S. public
companies, including Wayfair and via Wayfair, Wal-Mart (I’m sure they will be horrified to
learn), were, until the Times reporter called, likely selling toxic, formaldehyde-drenched
Chinese-made laminate flooring seven months after the 60 Minutes story aired that has
destroyed Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL). Wayfair is my largest short position by far.


Here are some excerpts from the article below (I’m mentioned a couple of times):

As Lumber Liquidators continues to struggle in the aftermath of a safety crisis over
its Chinese-made laminate flooring, a much smaller flooring company has been
drawn into the spotlight.


The hedge fund manager who publicly accused Lumber Liquidators of selling wood
with dangerous levels of formaldehyde is leveling the same claims against Ark
Floors, a California importer of Chinese wood products that are sold all over the
United States.


…Test results from five types of Ark laminate show levels of formaldehyde “well
above” the emission standards set by the California Air Resources Board, according
to Josh Hosen, senior manager of certification programs at HPVA Laboratories, a
testing company in Reston, Va. Whitney Tilson, the hedge fund manager who runs
Kase Capital Management, hired HPVA to run the same tests on Ark’s products as
the lab had done on Lumber Liquidators’ products.


…It is difficult to know exactly where Ark’s laminate was sold and whether the
products are still on store shelves in the United States. Mr. Tilson has bet against the
stock of the online retailer, Wayfair, which sold the products on its website and
through Walmart.com.


While Wayfair listed some Ark products among its best-selling laminate, Jane
Carpenter, a spokeswoman for the website, said it had sold just 10 orders since
December 2014, including one order through Walmart.com. Jaeme Laczkowski, a
spokeswoman for Walmart.com, confirmed that the site had sold one order of
laminate through Wayfair before the product was removed.


…Lumber Liquidators’ stock has dropped more than 70 percent since Mr. Tilson
appeared in a March 1 episode of the CBS program “60 Minutes,” which accused
the company of selling Chinese-made laminate flooring that contained unsafe
amounts of formaldehyde.


The Consumer Product Safety Commission opened an investigation in March, and in
May, Lumber Liquidators announced that it would suspend sales of laminate
products from China.


But other companies, including Home Depot and Ark, appear to have sold laminate
from some of the same Chinese mills that supplied Lumber Liquidators, raising
questions about other products for sale in the United States.

“We all believe it’s a pervasive problem. It’s not just a Lumber Liquidators problem,”
said Denny Larson, an environmental consultant who works with plaintiffs’ lawyers.


…Shortly after “60 Minutes” broadcast its report on Lumber Liquidators, employees
at Ark were told that the company no longer sold laminate to California customers
unless it had a CARB-compliant label, three former employees said. Another former
employee, Tim Wang, who said he had worked in the sample department of Ark’s
California warehouse until July, confirmed that the company sold noncompliant
flooring outside of the state.


You may have never heard of Wayfair (NYSE:W), but it aims to be the Diapers.com or
Zappos of everything for the home – here’s the description of the company from Yahoo
Finance:


Wayfair Inc. engages in the e-commerce business in the United States. It offers
approximately seven million home products under various brands. The company’s
brands include Wayfair.com that focuses on offering home furnishings and décor
from low-to high-end and across various styles; Joss & Main, an online flash sales
site; AllModern, an online destination for original design for modern home
enthusiasts; DwellStudio, an online design studio for modern, fashion-forward home
furnishings; and Birch Lane, a destination for classic style home designs. Wayfair
Inc. also sells its products through retail partners. Wayfair Inc. was founded in 2002
and is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts.


It has grown like wildfire – that’s what willingness to lose a ton of money plus buying a lot
of Google keywords will do! – and has TTM revenues of nearly $2 billion. It went public a
year ago and now has a nearly $4 billion market cap. It just reported Q3 earnings this
morning and had a conference call at 8am.


This isn’t my largest short position because I had an opinion on what Q3 earnings would
look like. Rather, it’s primarily because it has one of the worst business models I’ve ever
seen. Competing head-to-head vs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD),
Target (NYSE:TGT), Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM), etc. (did I mention AMAZON???), I
think the company’s odds of ever reaching breakeven, much less earning a profit, much
less earning enough of a profit to justify a nearly $4 billion market cap are close to zero.
(Operating income over the last four quarters was -$137 million, 71% higher than the -$80
million in the four quarters before that. The company has $399 million of cash and long-
term investments and no debt.)

In addition, this business is so poorly managed and/or spread so thin that they were
selling Chinese-made laminate long after everyone in the flooring industry knew (thanks to
60 Minutes) that there were big issues – and potential liabilities – associated with this
product so extreme caution was called for.


Just as I did with Lumber Liquidators, I hired a testing company to purchase and test five
samples of Ark laminate flooring from Wayfair’s web site. All five failed the California Air
Resources Board (CARB2) limit in spectacular fashion (by a factor of 2-5x). In fact, the
test results were very similar to those for the three samples of Lumber Liquidators
Chinese-made laminate that I had tested more than a year ago.


To be clear, however, I am not claiming that Wayfair is Lumber Liquidators Part 2. Lumber
Liquidators was selling ~$140 million annually of Chinese-made laminate flooring before
the scandal, whereas Wayfair claims to have “sold just 10 orders since December 2014,
including one order through Walmart.com.” Also, Wayfair was smart enough to
immediately pull the product once the Times reporter called and made them aware of the
potential problem. So the possible liabilities here are much lower – and, I suspect, there
was no intent to harm. Unlike Lumber Liquidators, I don’t think Wayfair was deliberately
poisoning its own customers to save a few bucks on sourcing costs.


Rather, to me it is compelling evidence of Wayfair’s gross incompetence and/or a business
that’s completely out of control. While the company was founded in 2002, it was only
rebranded and started pursuing extreme growth in 2011. They are now selling “seven
million home products” sourced from over 7,000 suppliers, and grew revenues 77% last
quarter – talk about growth run amok! I’ve seen this story so many times by companies
trying to justify their insane share prices. It’s a curse because it almost always ends in
tears…


Take a look at zulily for one good example that I shorted successfully. The company IPO’d
in late 2013, with the stock trading in the mid-$30s. It then briefly soared to over $70
before reality set in and the stock crashed to under $12 before investors got bailed out
(sort of) when Liberty Interactive (QVCA) bought zulily for $17.40.


One of my readers wrote to me with another analogy: “I think Wayfair is Overstock.com
2.0. It seems like the exact same business model.”


I replied: “I agree – and that has very sobering implications for Wayfair’s stock, as
Overstock, which I think is roughly fairly valued, trades at an EV/Sales multiple of 0.20x
whereas Wayfair’s is 2.05x, implying 90% downside for Wayfair’s stock…"
