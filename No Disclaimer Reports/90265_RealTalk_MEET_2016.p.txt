Summary


Short Ideas Tech


MEET has failed to beat revenue expectations for the first time in recent history
despite likely bearishness within estimates tied to a scathing short report.


New risk factors ahead of the Q touch on the same concerns The Bear’s short
reports discussed, suggesting revenues may already be imploding.


I question the difference between management’s words and their actions within this
brief MEET update.


I have been following The Friendly Bear's work on MeetMe (NASDAQ:MEET). I'm not
going to make estimates based on new findings, rather, this is an analysis of the
BRAND NEW RISK FACTORS within the 8-K filed on October 3 rd, 2016.


Before getting into the disclosures, it's news worthy that management also gave a pre-
announcement that is in-line (potentially a slight miss) with previous guidance and met
expectations. This is the first time they haven't BEATEN in recent history:

Without further ado, on to the added disclosures!

The first two risk factors seems overly bearish, but relate to the acquisition of Skout and
are the sort of thing an attorney would require you to add upon an acquisition. Please
find the full detail of the 8-K -Current report posted on the 4 th of October here. The first
relates to MEET's potential inability to realize synergies in relation to the acquisition, and
the second through fourth relate to the fact that integrating Skout's operations could
result in challenges that require significant resources.

The fifth is very odd in my opinion and commentary regarding management's intent
would likely be speculative. I'm wondering if management thinks they could be held
liable if hedge funds short their stock (that can't be right)? Or perhaps they don't want
people to think they're responsible for "propping the stock up (with a repurchase plan)?
Or maybe they simply want to tell the world that their stock is only declining
because they're a victim of a "baseless short attack"? I'm confused, but investors
should consider what management's intent is here:

Regardless of your beliefs regarding intent, The Friendly Bear earned a shout-out!!
Congrats my friend, short sellers can't receive a bigger compliment. Although the risk
factor is amusing, it's also worth noting that when management blames short sellers, it's
typically not a great sign for shareholders. That being said, if you've done the work,
and you've decided to own this stock, this disclosure shouldn't concern you; in
fact, you should thank The Friendly Bear for the great buying opportunity! The
next disclosure may be a little concerning though:

I've highlighted additions and changes since the last quarterly filing, and underlined
those that are particularly notable.


In his/her last article, The Bear suggested that MEET may end up being able to "fill the
void" with gaming companies, which would likely result in a significant hair cut regarding
CPM and revenue expectations:

The company's recent 8-K now warns against "… inconsistent ad rates…" which
seems consistent with The Friendly Bear's projections. MEET then adds the
language"…and potentially demands for rebates." What does that mean? I'm trying
not to speculate but given the graphic images within The Bear's first article, my only
guess is that advertisers saw their ads next to these images and demanded a
concession? Your guess is as good as mine, but I can say with confidence that this
addition isn't a tailwind for the bull case.


The next 8-K addition worth noting is"objections to the content of our apps and
websites". According to Roth's Company Note dated August 23 rd:

Which makes me wonder why this was added:


I connected with sources who listened to the MEET/Roth Q&A that took place on
8/18/2016. Management stated that no explicit pics are allowed, EVERY PIC is
reviewed by a human, who removes offending pics (drugs, KKK, swastika, nudity,
etc.). In fact, management said that 40% of the workforce is dedicated to
reviewing material on MEET apps/websites.


Therefore, an investor can assume that not only has management already been
monitoring content, they are extremely dedicated and there is no reason for concern
despite The Friendly Bear's reporting, right? But if there is no additional concern post
The Friendly Bear's article (I.e. this is a "baseless short attack without substance"), then
why did you add the additional disclosures!?


Conclusion


MEET management has led us to believe that they're a victim of a "baseless short
attack", while adding risk disclosures that are consistent with risks of which the short
reports have warned!

A source who uses the app with regularity has said that ad load times have gone up
dramatically. He said he has to wait for about 20 seconds for ads to load, and it used to
be nearly instantaneous. Obviously, his experience may mean nothing. If I were long
this stock, I'd worry that bidding has declined-- which would be consistent with
the disclosures discussed above. Management could certainly counter these
concerns with more transparency.


Offering the world some REAL TALK when expectations equate to irrational exuberance.
