CITRON RESEARCH
REPORTS ON CBEYOND
INC. (NASDAQ:CBEY)


Citron asks:  Can Investors “See Beyond”
market hype, and get to the cold truth
about CBEY? 


Not truly a high-tech company, Cbeyond’s business
model is in fact a sales organization selling a
product that is no longer unique.  It provides
bundled telecomm services to small to mid-size
companies (generally 4 to 100 lines) in a package. 
This includes business phone, long distance,
internet, mobile phone, website hosting, voicemail,
and optional services. Their business plan is
centered on hiring a sales force of ambitious young
people who actually go knocking door to door in
o�ce parks to solicit customers, incentivized by big
commissions for reeling in new customers on three
year contracts. 


Citron believes the growth story the company
wants Wall St. to believe is pure �ction.  Adjust it to
reality, and you have a low-or-no-growth company
with sustainable market presence in only 3 or 4
cities, selling for a PE of over 100.  From this
precarious point, the stock could fall by 2/3rds and
still be seriously overpriced.


Cbeyond had noteworthy success during 2000 to
2002 as these bundled services were not
commoditized yet and their aggressive sales
strategy was paid o� in the �rst three cities in which
it started service- Atlanta, Dallas and Denver.  This

was enough to create a positive enough earnings
outlook to embark on an ambitious plan to roll out
the same model in 9 more markets, with pushpins
in the map for an additional dozen or so to follow.


Taking up this plan without critical review, the
analyst community has simply assumed the
company line that Cbeyond is on track to achieve
similar penetration in every market they enter. 
Most of the covering �rms and the company’s
“analysis” consist of taking the table of cities,
multiplying the market size by 11%, and adding up
the fantasized revenue.  Even the pessimistic Bank
of America analyst, who yesterday downgraded the
stock with a 12 target, makes the same broad-brush
assumption that they will achieve 10% market share
in the 10 new markets they are trying to add.  But
other than Houston, CBeyond is at market
penetration of 5% in just one city, 4% in another,
and 2% or less in the other 4, which include their
largest and most competitive markets.


Citron would love to know on what basis do either
the company or the covering analysts have to
believe that CBEY can achieve 11% penetration in
new markets.


Citron believes CBEY is a single digit stock for the
following reasons:


1) Tracking of market penetration in newer cities
is lagging disastrously far behind Cbeyond’s
original “big 3”. 


Astonishingly, the analysts still peg Cbeyond’s
valuation based on the assumption they will
capture 11% market share in every market they
enter.  However, a more detailed analysis
increasingly exposes the fallacy.  Cbeyond’s
�nancial reports obscure just how poorly it is doing
in its new markets — pro�ts from the 3 or 4 top
markets subsidize the unfolding disappointments in
the newer markets. 


If you compare all the newer cities on a timeline
from startup in the market, you see an undeniable
negative pattern:  The EBITDA in each newer market
is worse than the original cities.  And the newer the
market, the worse the comparison becomes.

2)  Competitive forces have been mounting
steadily and now present a totally di�erent
landscape than when Cbeyond established its
presence in its lead cities a decade ago. 


Here is one piece of reading that spells the obvious

More importantly, as mentioned in a Merrill Lynch
research report from June 29, it is not only pricing
with their current competition that CBEY has to
worry about but it is the inevitable push of cable
operators threatening their mainline business – the
cable companies are simply better con�gured to go
cheaper and wireless.

3)  Increasing churn rates.  Probably the single
most toxic statistic to Cbeyond is “churn rate” – the
rate at which it loses existing customers.  Cbeyond
quotes its churn as a monthly �gure, so some
investors may not understand the true signi�cance
of a rise from a historically “below 1%” to current
1.5% — which is a rise from single digits to 18% per
year. 


Cbeyond’s churn rate is a measure of the installed
base that the company loses as customers. 
Presumably it is comprised of:


Customer companies that go out of
business or severely downsize
Customer companies that move out
of Cbeyond’s service areas
Customer companies that leave
Cbeyond due to service
dissatisfaction

Customer companies that leave
Cbeyond due to price competition


Cbeyond’s historically reported “churn rate” was
below 1%   Now it has risen precipitously.  The
company purports the churn has now “stabilized” at
1.5%.  This represents a loss of 18% of the customer
base each year.  If you think that’s a small increase
to a small number, look deeper!  Especially note the
impact this rate has on those “sweet spot
customers”:

24.0% 4 years 2

The churn rate increase from 1.00% to 1.5% already
lopped nearly 3 years from average customer
retention.  This increase e�ectively reduces by half
the “sweet spot” revenue from customers retained
after their customer acquisition costs (eg sales
commissions) have been amortized. 


If the churn rate increases towards 2.0%, note how
the retention rate dips perilously close to the 3 year
contract term over which the company has paid a
huge incentive commission.   But a lot of damage to
the “sweet spot customers” has already been done.

Looking at the churn rate this way puts in a new
light why the company seems so quick to
pronounce the economic downturn already over. 
They almost have to believe this if they are to
defend their growth model.  A high churn rate is
simply toxic to its “over-the-rainbow”: �nancial
projections.  The truth is the current economic
downturn is hitting their customers – small to
midsize US based companies, the hardest.


Interestingly enough there is a current shareholder
class action lawsuit against CBEY and its
management for speci�cally making misstatements
designed to hide the fact that CBEY was recording a
higher churn rate than they were reporting while
directors sold close to $40 million in stock.


4)  Houston, we have a problem!  CBEY is being
sued by the City of Houston alleging that Cbeyond
has been underpaying right-of-way fees to the city
since 2004.  The City of Houston is seeking
unspeci�ed damages arising from the alleged
underpayment.   If this hold suit holds any merit
and the City of Dallas follows, than Cbeyond could
lose all of their available cash and jeopardize their
business model in one of their core markets.  Citron
will follow up this story at a later date with
appropriate court documents,


Conclusion


Citron has more to say about this company.   We
believe customer satisfaction and looming legal
issues warrant further coverage.  But the points
raised here should be su�cient to raise critical
questions about a company with a trailing-twelve-
month PE of 150, which runs a narrow business
model facing increasingly commoditization with
competition from the big boys of telecomm and
cable.  CBEY has more than its work cut out for
itself. 


Citron believes CBEY’s best days are behind them. 
Investors who “follow the money” see beyond – a
company whose insiders have sold stock in larger
amounts than the company’s remaining cash. 


Cautious investing to all.
