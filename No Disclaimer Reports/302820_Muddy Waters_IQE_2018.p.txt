Q: I spoke to your colleague about a technician role at CSC.  I was passed your details.  Would it 
be possible to get a little more information about the role?  Is it with CSC or IQE?  Or is that 
effectively the same thing? 
 
IQE HR: The role is CSC, which is a joint venture with IQE and Cardiff University.  Essentially 
though it is the same contract as all other IQE employees and is based at our site in Cardiff.

On February 5th, the first business day after the ShadowFall report was released, we called CSC.  The phone 
again was answered as “IQE”.  We expressly stated that we wanted to speak with someone from CSC and 
not IQE, and we were connected to Robert Harper.  While his LinkedIn profile shows him as a program 
director at CSC, it also shows that he is still employed by IQE (thus the one person with both companies 
simultaneously on his LinkedIn profile):

When we inquired with Mr. Harper about CSC, he suggested we call Wyn Meredith, who according to his 
LinkedIn profile has worked exclusively for CSC since leaving IQE in 2015 (the one employee we found 
on LinkedIn who lists CSC exclusive of IQE), or Chris Meadows (discussed above). 
 
All of this begs the question: Who are the 74 employees who worked at CSC as of 2016 and earned £2.6 
million?

Colin Whitehouse is listed as the Chairman of CSC.  However, Mr. Whitehouse’s LinkedIn page indicates 
that Mr. Whitehouse is a non-executive chairman of CSC and that he apparently does not even work at the 
joint venture full-time.  Rather, Mr. Whitehouse lists his primary occupation is a “Science, Technology & 
Innovation Consultant and Independent Advisor” in Worcester, England, over 100 KM from CSC’s 
supposed center in Cardiff.

We are curious as to what exactly CSC sells IQE.  CSC is supposed to be a R&D company, but our 
worldwide search for patent applications using the European Patent Office applicant database revealed zero 
results for CSC.

We are skeptical that CSC is operating at arm’s length from IQE.  There is ample evidence suggesting IQE 
dominates it, which conceptually could make it an alter ego of IQE.  Therefore, these facts and opinions 
reinforce our view that the transactions between IQE and CSC lack substance, and results should be adjusted 
to exclude their impacts.   
 
 
IQE’s 1H 2017 Capitalized Intangible Investments Blew Out, just as CSC’s Earnings Contributions 
Collapsed 
 
We believe it is reasonable to adjust 1H 2017 net income down by approximately £5 million or 69% to 
account for likely aggressive capitalization of expenses: 
 


 
 
By December 31, 2016, CSC had just £13,000 in cash left, meaning its utility to boost IQE’s earnings was 
limited.  (In 2017, Cardiff University seems to have extended CSC another loan of £800,000, which pales 
in comparison to the £23.0 million the university had previously invested.)  In 1H 2017, IQE’s capitalized 
intangible investments exploded.  At the same time, IQE suddenly stopped disclosing detail that would be 
helpful in understanding this spike.  Maybe this blowout is great news for the future – investment in highly 
productive assets that will drive growing returns for years.  Or maybe IQE aggressively sought ways to 
keep expenses off its income statement.  We personally lean toward the latter explanation given the 
previously discussed accounting issues.  Therefore, an IQE sceptic might want to adjust 1H 2017 income 
downward by approximately £5 million, which is the difference between 1H 2017 and 2H 2016 investment 
levels.

1H 2017

IQE’s investments in intangibles spiked in 1H 2017: 
 


 
 
 
IQE simultaneously became more opaque in its disclosures about these investments, strongly implying that 
the increase is difficult to justify.  In the 1H 2016 interim report, and in every previous interim report, IQE 
broke out two categories on its cash flow statement under investing activities.  The first was “capitalised 
development expenditure” (£2,784k in 1H 2016), and the second was “investment in other intangible fixed 
assets” (£755k in 1H 2016).  Yet in its 1H 2017 interim report, IQE combined these two categories into an 
item labelled “investment in intangible fixed assets.”  These “investments” exceeded £9.6 million pounds 
in 1H 2017, vs. only £3.5 million in 1H 2016.   
 
By comparing 2016 figures, it is clear that “investment in intangible fixed assets” is a catch all that includes 
capitalized development costs.

We think this accounting treatment is problematic.  By removing a separate line item labelled “capitalized 
development expenditure” in its 1H 2017 interim report, IQE has made it impossible for investors to 
determine the amount of costs capitalized in that period.  Compare this with previous periods, in which IQE 
broke out the figures.

We note that while cash outflows for capitalized investments in intangible assets increased by 108.7% from 
2H 2016 to 1H 2017, amortization of intangible only increased 12.5% from £2.4 million to £2.7 million.   
 
Insider Share Transactions Bookend JV Earnings Magic4 
 
From October through December 2014, IQE insiders Messrs. Nelson, Rasmussen, Williams, and Ainsworth 
acquired a total of 20.5 million shares at a weighted average price of £0.13 (total £2.6 million).  This was 
soon before IQE’s joint ventures started transacting with IQE.  Between May 2017 through July 2017, these 
insiders sold £7.8 million of shares (7.18 million shares at an average price of £1.08).   
 
A sceptic might view the purchases not so much as prescient, but rather as insiders understanding of the 
type of accounting gains IQE stood to make from the joint ventures.  A sceptic might also view the 
monetization around the close of 1H 2017 – a period in which we suspect IQE could have been 
unsustainably aggressive in its accounting – as signalling the company is unlikely to be able to continue to 
produce such gains with CSC’s funding largely spent.  On the other hand, maybe this is all a coincidence.   
 
Conclusion 
 
We understand that Cardiff University, Wales, and the UK government see IQE as an important part of the 
noble enterprise of creating highly skilled jobs in the region.  We genuinely wish them all the best in this 
endeavour and hope it will be extremely successful.  None of those feelings, however, can alleviate our 
concern that Cardiff University has not been shrewd enough in its dealings with IQE.   
 
IQE received significant accounting benefits from CSC.  These benefits came at a cost of millions of pounds 
to the university.  IQE insiders have financially benefitted from recent sales of shares at prices significantly 
higher than prior to CSC’s commencement.  The university should ask whether the benefits it is receiving 
are worth the cost.  In the meantime, shareholders should ask whether IQE’s financial performance since 
2015 can be sustained.
