Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole?
Aug. 29, 2012 12:14 PM ET4 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Talk about tricky moves. As a young public company with a tainted leadership team and
an expensive shopping habit, Tangoe (OTC:TNGO) could have easily tripped over tough
questions alone by now. So far, however, Tangoe has spent more than a full year
successfully dancing around a maze of potential landmines.


While the previous company led by its CEO and CFO literally exploded - with the pair
directly blamed for that notorious collapse - and its growth depends more heavily on
acquisitions than management likes to admit, records indicate, Tangoe has yet to stumble
even once since it burst onto the stage. A $20 highflier, in fact, Tangoe trades at a rich
premium when compared to both the general sector overall and the specific multiples that
it has paid for the companies it keeps buying to fuel its amazing growth.


Hatched a dozen years ago just as the first public company long steered by its top
executives approached death, Tangoe specializes in the niche arena known as
telecommunications expense management (TEM). In a nutshell, Tangoe basically
promises notable reductions in a major ongoing business expense by using a technology-
driven system designed to shrink the bloated bills that companies often receive for
everything from Internet to landline and cell phone services.


Currently in the midst of a muscular growth spurt, Tangoe has spent the past two years
gobbling up smaller players that resemble itself in order to further bulk up its own share of
that tasty market. That feast has cost a fortune, however, with growth-hungry investors
footing much of the tab along the way.


Tapping the capital markets twice in the span of just 10 months, records show Tangoe has
raised a combined $100 million (after fees) and effectively spent most of that to fuel the
very growth that makes its stock look so appetizing in the first place. In a shopping frenzy
that began around the festive season and never really stopped, records show, Tangoe has
managed to run up a bill totaling more than $75 million on acquisitions so far (not counting
the $4 million owed on previous deals) and still remains on the hunt for even more.


Because of that expensive (and often risky) growth strategy, Tangoe looks an awful lot like
the so-called "rollup" companies that have by now given investors plenty of reason for
alarm.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 2/14


As the last acquisition-driven company examined by TheStreetSweeper has already
proven, those highfliers can sometimes crash in spectacular fashion. Just look at Swisher
Hygiene (NASDAQ:SWSH) for some timely evidence. The stock chart for that rollup
company tells a horror story (briefly summarized later) all by itself.


Tangoe looks more like a fairy tale at this point itself. Applauded from the start, when it
debuted as a bleeding company with a decade of losses, Tangoe rapidly doubled in price
months before reaching its first anniversary on the Nasdaq exchange. The stock went on
to peak above $23 a share and continues to hover near the high end of that range,
records show, even after a dilutive secondary offering and the recent expiration of a
lockup period that could still flood the market with a river of shares.


In other words, at current levels, Tangoe arguably reflects few (if any) of the serious risks
that could threaten its generous stock price. By rewarding Tangoe with such a lofty
valuation, the remainder of this report would suggest, the market has overlooked all or
most of the following:


Top executives singled out in a class-action lawsuit (settled years after the CEO
assumed his current post) for allegedly falsifying financial results at their last public
company and effectively destroying it in the process
A boardroom populated with directors who have rushed to dump mountains of stock,
including several who should recognize potential signs of danger after leading ill-fated
companies of their own
An independent auditing firm cited by industry watchdogs for exercising poor oversight
when reviewing the books for a number of its other client
A risky acquisition-driven growth strategy - inherently vulnerable to accounting games -
- that has lost much of its former appeal after repeatedly backfiring and leaving former
highfliers in ruins
An expensive shopping spree, financed by the proceeds from stock offerings, that has
resulted in explosive growth so far but - with remaining buyout targets (and the excess
cash to cover them) now limited - could soon come to an end
A gigantic customer, responsible for more than 10% of past revenue (and rewarded
with stock for its help), that recently acquired a direct competitor and has apparently
stopped funneling the company so much business since that time
A set of nontraditional financial metrics, used by management as key measures of
success, that complicates the process of judging (and sometimes independently
verifying) quarterly results

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 3/14


A sharp rebound in noncore operations, previously fading in significance by design and
attracting little interest - or attention - from analysts as a result
A curious habit of beating profit estimates by a penny a share, with recent help from an
odd spike in noncore licensing fees like those that management allegedly overstated in
the past
A perfect track record for delivering that upside, which further intensifies the pressure
on management to please Wall Street by extending its winning streak


TheStreetSweeper has researched Tangoe extensively this summer, reviewing many of
these disturbing topics in detail, and packaged its findings in a comprehensive two-part
investigative report. As the first installment in that Tangoe series, this story examines both
the dark history of its leaders and the recent drivers of its celebrated growth; the remaining
article, set to follow soon, will further expand on issues highlighted in this story and cover
new ground as well.


TheStreetSweeper contacted Tangoe through its public relations firm, seeking input for
this report, but received no response from the company.


Broken Record?


By topping expectations every time that it posts quarterly results - and then touting "strong
organic growth" in its core business as a key driver of that success - Tangoe has clearly
managed to dazzle Wall Street with its performance so far. Analysts universally embrace
Tangoe because of that rapid expansion, but they also seem to overlook the hidden
contributions that have come into play.


For the past two quarters in a row, records indicate Tangoe actually needed some extra
help to impress a market spoiled by a string of pleasant surprises. The first time, company
records suggest, Tangoe relied on both a well-timed acquisition and a noncore business to
breeze past consensus estimates.


While management had originally predicted that a recent acquisition would add only
$500,000 to its first-quarter sales, records show, Tangoe actually wound up booking
$800,000 in revenue from that acquisition instead. When specifically asked about potential
differences between the projected and actual contributions provided by the new
companies that it had just purchased, however, Tangoe stuck by its original numbers -
portraying its old guidance as "in line" - despite the outsized boost that it had received as
a result of that especially helpful deal

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 4/14


Tangoe offered no clue at all (other than a brief mention later buried in its official corporate
filings) that it had booked 60% more revenue from that mid-quarter acquisition than
analysts had likely baked into their own forecasts. With Tangoe exceeding top-line
estimates by little more than $1 million that quarter, though, the company obviously relied
on that extra $300,000 for a material portion of its relatively modest upside.


More importantly, its filings suggest, Tangoe also needed a handy surge in noncore
operations to boost its profits above forecasts and avoid a potential outright miss. Long
after Tangoe shifted away from its original focus on consulting services and software
licensing, its filings show, the company has suddenly enjoyed a convenient uptick in those
forgotten businesses. In both of its most recent quarters, Tangoe has posted steep gains
in its noncore operations - an overlooked segment now growing even faster than the
celebrated TEM business itself - with that comeback proving critical on the first of those
occasions.


Tangoe recorded a 40% jump in sales generated by that overlooked division in the first
quarter, a stark difference from the meager single-digit gains that it had realized over the
course of the previous three years. For some reason, its filings suggest, Tangoe
spontaneously fielded an extra $800,000 worth of orders for its older services - with half of
that generated by lucrative software licensing fees - long after the company had given up
on actively pursuing that business itself. Without that helpful burst in demand, records
indicate, Tangoe would have strained to simply meet (let alone beat) profit forecasts for
the first quarter and ruined its perfect record for outperformance by now.


Because software license fees often carry gigantic margins (of 80% and beyond), most of
those sales drop straight to the bottom line. By recording a $400,000 increase in those
valuable fees during the first quarter (with a similar boost in other noncore services further
adding to that help), records indicate, Tangoe wound up with a convenient surplus that it
really seemed to need.


Due largely (if not entirely) to the huge uptick in its noncore businesses that quarter,
records suggest, Tangoe managed to once again beat profit targets by a penny a share -
requiring a mere $375,000 cushion - and keep its reassuring pattern neatly intact.


The day after the company delivered that particular upside "surprise," with management
bragging about organic growth in its core TEM business as usual, Tangoe actually hit its
highest price on record. If Tangoe sparked a thrilling celebration with those financial
results, however, the company also jarred some rather disturbing memories in the
process.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 5/14


Vanishing Act


Back when Tangoe CEO Albert Subbloie and CFO Gary Martino filled those same
positions at doomed Information Management Associates (IMA), court records show, that
company reported a hefty surge in its own software licensing fees that set its stock on fire
as well. Within months of announcing the welcome "turnaround" that ignited its shares,
however, IMA revealed that it had grossly embellished its true financial performance and
now faced a material restatement as a result.


Outraged shareholders later responded by filing a class-action lawsuit against IMA and its
top executives, naming Subbloie and Martino as the only individual defendants and
therefore holding them personally responsible for the fiasco.


"Defendants engaged in a common course of conduct that operated as a fraud on the
integrity of the market for IMA common stock by intentionally or recklessly issuing
quarterly financial statements which materially overstated the company's actual revenues
and assets and materially understated its expenses and net loss," that lawsuit proclaimed.
Indeed, "25% of the revenue originally reported did not exist …


"These manipulations created the appearance that IMA's financial condition was
improving drastically from a year earlier," the lawsuit added, "when in fact IMA'S financial
condition was rapidly deteriorating" instead.


Dangerously low on cash, the complaint stated, IMA fabricated half of its quarterly
revenue from licensing fees - booking millions that it could not reasonably expect to collect
- and wound up securing the funds that the company desperately needed in order to
survive. As the CFO responsible for compiling those numbers, records show, Martino
wasted no time basking in the glory of the applause that erupted on that report. The very
day that IMA loudly trumpeted its newfound "success," the company also casually noted
that Martino had decided to step down as its longtime finance chief and oversee a new
subsidiary instead. While Martino retained his secondary role as chairman of the board, he
quickly distanced himself from the executive suite - and the finance office in particular -
ahead of the disaster that would soon begin to unfold.


Before his replacement could even close the books on another quarter, records show, IMA
returned to the market with jarring news of a massive restatement that instantly hammered
its stock and ultimately left the entire company in ruins. As IMA spiraled toward
bankruptcy, records show, its longtime leaders - permanent fixtures at the company they
had cofounded for about a decade by then -- effectively vanished from the scene.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 6/14


After first quietly joining the board of the company that would soon become Tangoe itself,
records indicate, Subbloie and Martino steadily clipped all formal ties linking them to their
original failure. When they carried out their first big move by resigning from their
leadership positions at IMA (as CEO and chairman respectively), a local news report
shows, the Nasdaq promptly responded by halting the battered stock. When they followed
up with their second (and final) step by vacating their regular boardroom seats a few
months later, the press release announcing that development included no stock symbol at
all.


While the disgraced leaders volunteered to serve as "consultants" for another 90 days at
that point, IMA soon ran out of time and spared them the leftover hassle. Two weeks later,
records indicate, the company - its stock already halted, its resources now drained - filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and then faded into oblivion.


By the time that Tangoe itself went public more than a decade later, IMA lingered on as
little more than a distant memory. Tangoe included only a brief mention of the IMA
bankruptcy in its original registration statement, and then skipped even that in the more
timely proxy statement that has since followed. With the former leaders of IMA now left to
share its story (on those rare occasions when it resurfaces at all), the company sounds
less like a victim of fraud -- a view that strapped investors clearly took -- and more like a
routine casualty of the dot-com crash instead.


Following an interview with Subbloie earlier this year, for example, a local business
newspaper simply mentioned that IMA had filed for bankruptcy after "the Internet bubble
burst" in a glowing article that basically painted its former leader - and his new company -
as a proven success.


Costly Production


Yet Tangoe looks a bit vulnerable itself. Even though its top executives stand accused of
cooking the books in the past, records indicate, Tangoe has taken no extra precautions to
prevent a disaster like that from striking again.


For starters, its filings continue to suggest, Tangoe has yet to even implement standard
internal controls over its financial reporting process. Furthermore, records show, Tangoe
has placed a tarnished auditing firm - with a record of outright "audit failures" - in charge of
catching any misstatements that the company, without its own safeguards, might have
included in its books.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 7/14


When IMA selected its own auditors, court records show, the company actually chose two
different top-name firms that (at the time) ranked among the most respected in the
country. Of course, those same records indicate, IMA also terminated both of those
auditors after they took exception with its accounting practices upon a thorough review of
its books.


Tangoe did hire one of those big-name firms for a consulting project, its filings show, with
PricewaterhouseCoopers reviewing its compensation policies and recommending bigger
payouts for its top executives. But Tangoe stopped short of splurging on that respected
firm as its actual auditor for some reason, records show, even though its business model
heightens the complexity of its financial reports.


Despite the moderate image that its leaders like to present, Tangoe bears an obvious
resemblance to traditional rollup companies with inherently risky business strategies.
Leaning heavily on acquisitions to supplement its organic growth, records show, Tangoe
regularly buys up smaller companies and then books their revenues as its very own. While
perfectly legal and even formerly popular, that strategy has also proven notoriously
susceptible to accounting tricks and other hidden dangers that can result in some rather
tragic consequences for investors.


Take Swisher as a convenient example. A popular growth stock with massive gains itself
not so long ago, Swisher went public in late 2010 with grand plans to consolidate firms
that provide cleaning services into a single empire under the seasoned guidance of the
same executives who built the Blockbuster and Waste Management (NYSE:WM) chains.
Thanks to the breathless pace of its top-line growth and the high-profile status of its
leaders, Swisher soon took off as a powerful momentum stock - its market value
ballooning past $1.5 billion at its peak -- but deflated for good once TheStreetSweeper
sounded an alarm about the company.


Regardless of its expertise at cleaning bathrooms and such, the company itself turned out
to be a real mess. A repackaged failure with its original stock trashed by its namesake
founder on his way to prison for fraud, Swisher looked even worse than some rollup
companies that might have fuzzy numbers and red ink all over their books. With its dark
secrets exposed, Swisher took an ugly hit and - now in the process of scrubbing its
financial statements - could soon lose the stock listing that it secured less than two years
ago. A double-digit stock at the height of its craze, Swisher has already plunged to just
$1.66 a share in the meantime.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 8/14


These days, the same rollup company that made such a big splash with its sharp gains is
instead making embarrassing news for its stupidity by landing in a popular weekly column
known as "The 5 Dumbest Things on Wall Street."


"Come on, guys," TheStreet.com prodded on Friday. "Why is it so hard to hand in your
homework? Dog ate your 10Qs?"


For its part, records indicate, Tangoe routinely tries to downplay acquisitions (a topic often
mentioned as a mere afterthought) and carefully distance itself from the dangerous rollup
strategy that has wrecked so many former highfliers over the years. Every time that
Tangoe issues its financial results, for example, the company simply starts by reporting an
explosion in total revenue - with acquisitions keeping that number above 50% until the
most recent quarter - and then goes on to trumpet solid "organic growth" in recurring
revenue from its core operations as well.


To date, records show, Tangoe has consistently pegged that organic growth rate at "20%
or better" and cited a figure closer to 30% as recently as a year ago. For some reason,
however, Tangoe now seems reluctant to share the exact number that should have
resulted when management took the extra steps required to calculate that growth rate in
the first place.


During its past two quarterly conference calls, for example, Tangoe merely offered a
vague "estimate" that placed its organic growth rate "in the low to mid-20% range" and (as
usual) above the targets set by the company itself. While this estimate may look both solid
and consistent, the possibilities implied by that range all fall below the figure supplied a
year ago and therefore represent a slowdown in organic growth. Without the precise
formula (and underlying numbers) that Tangoe uses to calculate its organic growth rate,
however, investors cannot monitor - or independently verify - this reassuring metric on
their own.


Tangoe does supply obligatory "pro forma" numbers in its regulatory filings, though, which
represent the estimated contributions provided by acquisitions to its total revenue. Based
on those figures (often used to extract organic growth rates at other acquisitive
companies), Tangoe has achieved far more modest internal gains than those that
management keeps broadcasting to the public.


Without any helpful surge from acquisitions, those estimates indicate, Tangoe would have
seen its core revenue grow by just 13% -- a full 10 percentage points below the midpoint
of the range presented by management - throughout the first half of the current year.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 9/14


Furthermore, earlier pro forma numbers suggest, Tangoe would have mustered only
single-digit revenue gains on its own the year when the company arrived on the market in
the midst of a tantalizing growth spurt.


Thanks to yet another buyout deal (its biggest one so far), Tangoe can now bank on some
help with its future growth rate as well. When Tangoe reported its latest quarterly results,
the company relied on a major last-minute acquisition - which literally closed that same
day - to offer a noteworthy boost in its full-year guidance.


Without rushing into that deal, records indicate, Tangoe would have been stuck with a
forecast that Wall Street (accustomed to better) might view with alarm. Excluding the
projected cushion provided by that deal, Tangoe would have issued guidance that actually
fell a bit shy of its previous top-line estimates for the second-half of the year and (when
adjusted to reflect a change in the share count) simply matched its prior bottom-line
forecasts at best.


While Tangoe may have raised its guidance by a healthy margin as a result of that deal,
however, outright bulls raised some rather pressing questions in response. Now that
Tangoe has purchased so many of its smaller rivals, one analyst wondered, was the
company finally ready to "take a breather on some of the M&A (merger and acquisition)
activity for a while?" If not, the analyst asked, would Tangoe be returning to the capital
markets with its hands out once again?


After buying up a string of smaller players with the help of its IPO proceeds, Tangoe had
raised another $37.8 million (after fees) this spring and just pledged the equivalent of all
that - and then some - for its biggest acquisition in history. Once Tangoe covered the $30
million down payment on that $41 million deal, its filings show, the company would have
$48.4 million left in the bank and need most of that for looming bills.


Tangoe must cough up $34.4 million to cover leftover acquisition payments and operating
leases over the course of the next 12 months, its filings show, with the bulk of that eaten
up by the hefty sums that it still owes on companies already stuffed into its bulging
portfolio. Beyond that, Tangoe has also listed "amounts due under various debt and credit
facilities of $17.6 million" in its most recent quarterly report. With all but $14 million of its
existing funds already committed for acquisition and lease payments, its filings indicate,
Tangoe lacks even the cash necessary to offset those existing liabilities.


In other words, its filings clearly suggest, Tangoe effectively ended the first half of this year
in a "net debt" or "negative net cash" position.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 10/14


At the same time, of course, Tangoe must cover routine expenses - with the company
spending $2.4 million so far this year on rent payments alone - and obviously save some
cash to finance its actual operations. Since Tangoe needs so much money to cover its bills
and generates only so much cash on its own (while barely clearing $500,000 in actual
profits in the first half of this year), records indicate, the company looks strapped even
without the added burden of yet another expensive shopping trip.


Regardless of its financial situation (and the gentle suggestion of a friendly analyst),
however, Tangoe has so far refused to back away from its capital-intensive growth
strategy. When directly pressed on that sensitive matter upon closing its new record-
breaking deal, in fact, Tango bluntly stated that it would "continue to look at acquisitions"
and strongly implied that it had plenty of cash to spare.


Curtain Call?


At this point, however, Tangoe could find itself hunting for attractive targets in vain. After
all, logic would suggest, Tangoe cannot keep on acquiring other players in the same
space (and booking their revenue as its own) if it has run out of companies to buy.


"With the closing of this acquisition," Barclays quickly noticed, "Tangoe has really
completed the majority of the possible consolidation in the TEM market, as they are
significantly larger than the next closest competitor" and significantly smaller than a pair of
heavyweights that round out the group.


Besides Tangoe itself, Barclays indicated, only two industry giants - IBM (NYSE:IBM) and
Vodafone (NASDAQ:VOD) - remain as major stand-alone players in that field. With the
market valuing IBM and Vodafone at $225 billion and $145 billion, respectively, those
companies obviously fall outside of Tangoe's modest price range.


If anything, records suggest, Tangoe better hope that IBM simply keeps on sending a lot of
business its way.


Tangoe landed IBM as a major client back in the fall of 2009, when the two companies
forged a "strategic relationship" that offered benefits to both parties involved. After that,
Tangoe counted on IBM for more than 10% of the revenue that it reported for two years in
a row. Tangoe in turn rewarded its big partner for the business that it provided, filings
show, issuing IBM warrants for a huge pile of its stock in exchange for meeting
established revenue targets.

5/23/2018 Tangoe: Dancing On An Old Grave, Digging A New Hole? - Tangoe (OTCMKTS:TNGO) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/835711-tangoe-dancing-on-an-old-grave-digging-a-new-hole 11/14


Before IBM swallowed a Tangoe rival of its own during the first quarter of this year, records
show, it scored plenty of those warrants and exercised them at prices that offered some
rather handsome paper gains. By the end of the very next quarter, however, that situation
had apparently changed. Since its big partner failed to meet "specified new contractual
revenue commitments" under a revised agreement set forth last year, Tangoe revealed in
its recent quarterly filings, IBM earned no additional warrants and that agreement
effectively expired.


When questioned about IBM three months earlier (more than nine months into that
amended 12-month agreement), however, Tangoe had reassured investors about the
status of that important relationship. Subbloie had specifically characterized the situation
as "status quo" during the first-quarter conference call, adding that company leaders "don't
see any change in the relationship" with IBM and "still feel good about the channel
partnership" that the company had established.


To some Tangoe skeptics, however, that arrangement looked shaky at best -- and
hopeless at worst - even then.


"The question had been, 'When your strategic partner acquires a big competitor, does it
hurt your sales?'" recalled a hedge fund manager with a short position in the stock. "The
answer seems to be, 'Yes.'


"This seemed like a 'pay-to-play' deal in the first place," the bear added, "given that IBM
seems to have gotten paid in Tangoe warrants/shares a significant dollar amount relative
to the sales they generated for Tangoe. Now IBM has no remaining incentive to do
business with Tangoe. Plus, they own a Tangoe competitor.


"It's bad all around for Tangoe."


After leaning comfortably on IBM as a major source of its past revenue - and depending
heavily on acquisitions as a crucial driver of its recent growth - Tangoe could obviously
take a fall without the ongoing support long provided by either (let alone both) of those
important crutches. By dumping so much of their own stock lately, Tangoe insiders sure
seem unwilling to even wait and see if the company will continue to stand tall. Since
February alone - the very month when IBM happened to close its acquisition of a Tangoe
rival - insiders have literally sold the equivalent of 17% of all the company stock that freely
trades on the open market today.
