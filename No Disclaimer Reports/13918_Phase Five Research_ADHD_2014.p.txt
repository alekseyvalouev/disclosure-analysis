Summary
Alcobra is due to announce the results of its Phase II/III trial with Metadoxine
Extended Release in Adults with ADHD in the upcoming days.


In Alcobra’s latest clinical study, MDX was revealed to have no effect on a
subgroup of patients which constitute 60% of the whole ADHD contingent.


MDX managed to hit the study’s primary endpoint in this previous trial due to a
small and homogenous patient population and a strong effect on one of the patient
subgroups.


A larger patient sample in the current Phase II/III trial will work strongly against the
hidden pitfall; we assume high probability the primary endpoint will not be met.


With ATM Straddle selling for more than 70% move, the options are pricing two
extreme scenarios which we believe will not materialize.


Alcobra Pharma (ADHD) is a late-clinical-stage Israeli biopharmaceutical company
developing Metadoxine Extended Release (MDX/MG01CI) - a non-stimulant therapy for
the treatment of Adult and Pediatric Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

MDX is not a novel compound, but Alcobra's studies mark the first time the drug is
tested in ADHD. MDX is an ion-pair salt of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), and its immediate-
release formulation has been approved in several countries since the 1980s to treat
acute alcohol intoxication and withdrawal symptoms in adults. Numerous studies
exploring the efficacy of vitamin B6 and its derivatives have been initiated before based
on the premise that ADHD patients commonly lack adequate vitamins to produce vital
neurotransmitters in the brain.


If MDX succeeds in reaching the market, Alcobra will compete amongst Novartis (NVS),
Teva (TEVA), Shire (SHPG), Janssen and Lilly (LLY), currently marketing ADHD
treatments which include various formulations of methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta),
amphetamines (Adderall, Vyvanse) and atomoxetine (Strattera) - another nonstimulant
medication currently approved for the treatment of Adult ADHD.


Alcobra is due to announce the results of its 6-Week Phase 2/3 study of MDX in Adults
with ADHD in the upcoming days.


About ADHD and its patient subgroups


Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is a psychiatric disorder of the
neurodevelopmental type in which there are significant problems of attention,
hyperactivity, or acting impulsively that are not appropriate for a person's age.


Diagnosis of ADHD remains relatively subjective. It is most commonly obtained by a
psychiatric assessment which is intended to eliminate other potential causes. A formal
diagnosis is completed by a qualified physician and is based on a number of set criteria.
DSM-IV and now, more commonly, DSM-V diagnostic criteria are used widely to
diagnose ADHD.


All patients who receive an ADHD diagnosis from their physician are further diagnosed
by their subtype. The DSM categorizes patients with ADHD by three main subtypes:
combined-type (CT), inattentive-type (PI) and hyperactive-impulsive-type (HI). ADHD-PI
is characterized by symptoms of inattentiveness and differs from the combined type
ADHD (ADHD-CT) in that symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity may be absent or
minimal.

The exact prevalence of the various subtypes is not known, and various studies
estimate the prevalence of the ADHD-CT subtype to be the most prevalent at 50-70%,
the ADHD-PI subtype to be 30-50%, and ADHD-HI to be less than 10%.


MDX Clinical Trials to Date


So far, Alcobra has run a number of trials testing the efficacy of MDX in Adult ADHD
(table 1). The current Phase 2/3 trial is the first time MDX is being tested at sites outside
of Israel (predominantly US).


Endpoints have been virtually the same in all the trials, and the recently completed
Phase 2b trial and the currently running Phase 2/3 trial for the Adult ADHD indication
have been set up identically to each other, with the same primary and secondary
endpoints and inclusion and exclusion criteria.


The primary endpoint is the mean change in the Conners' Adult ADHD Rating Scale -
Investigator Rated (CAARS-INV), a widely accepted clinical measure of the presence
and severity of ADHD symptoms. The secondary endpoints are the mean changes in
the computerized TOVA test (Test of Variables of Attention) score, the Adult ADHD
Quality of Life (AAQoL) score and the Clinical Global Impression Improvement Scale
(CGI-I) score.

Awaiting results


The company's latest study was a 6-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
Phase IIb study in 120 adult subjects with ADHD involving once-daily administration of
MDX. ADHD subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two treatment
groups: 1400mg MDX or matching placebo.

Analysis of the study's results (fig. 1) showed that improvements in CAARS scores
(p=0.02), TOVA ADHD scores (p=0.02) and AAQoL scores (p=0.01) were observed in
the MDX treated group versus the placebo group. Response rate analysis showed that
44% of the patients exhibited over 40% improvement in CAARS-INV scores (p=0.04), in
contrast with 24% in the placebo group (p=0.03).

Post-hoc analysis revealed lack of efficacy on the ADHD-CT subgroup


While endpoints have been met with statistical significance in the phase IIb study, Post-
hoc analysis of the results revealed startling discrepancies in the efficacy of MDX
amongst different ADHD patient subgroups.


CAARS scores from the Phase IIb study were analyzed in order to interpret the efficacy
of MDX on symptom subscales and patient subgroups: inattentive versus hyperactive-
impulsive symptoms and predominantly inattentive (PI) versus combined type (CT)
subtypes of patients. The proportion of ADHD-PI patients in the study was revealed to
be ~41%, which is fairly representative of ADHD-PI prevalence in the adult population.
57.5% of the patients were ADHD-CT, and only two subjects were ADHD-HI (thus post-
hoc analysis was not conducted on the results from this subgroup).


The scores achieved by the ADHD-PI and ADHD-CT subgroups were analyzed on the
basis of how MDX was able to improve the following subscales of symptoms in each
group:

· Subscale A: Inattention only


· Subscale B: Hyperactivity-Impulsivity only


· Subscale C: Total ADHD symptoms


The analysis showed that Subscale A (inattention) symptoms were drastically improved
in the ADHD-PI patient subgroup (p<0.005) but were unaffected in the ADHD-CT group
(p>0.71; not statistically significant) (fig. 2). Subscale B (Hyperactivity-impulsivity)
symptoms were unaffected in both the ADHD-PI and ADHD-CT groups (p>0.21 (and
p>0.84, respectively; not statistically significant). Finally, Subscale C, or Total ADHD
symptoms were significantly improved in the ADHD-PI subgroup (p<0.05) but were not
improved in the ADHD-CT subgroup (p=0.61; not statistically significant) (fig. 3).

All in all, it was found that MDX does not improve any other symptoms other than
inattentiveness and does not affect the ADHD-CT group of patients. In the ADHD-
PI group, the drug showed a significant effect, as seen in the high response rate (56.5%
with a >40% improvement, p=0.0011).


Post-hoc analysis of the trial's secondary endpoints was similar to the findings of the
primary endpoint. TOVA scores were unchanged in the ADHD-CT and the ADHD-HI
subgroups, and were only improved in the ADHD-PI subgroup. In the ADHD-PI group,
the change in TOVA ADHD score from baseline to week 1 differed significantly between
patients taking metadoxine ER and those taking placebo (P < 0.04), as did the change
from baseline to week 6 (P < 0.05). The TOVA ADHD scores among patients in the
ADHD-CT group did not significantly differ when the drug and placebo groups were
compared, and did not show the early response seen in the ADHD-PI group (P = 0.74
for change at week 1 and P = 0.91 for change at week 6). The trend was unanimous
throughout all the other secondary endpoints.


Current Phase II/III study completed; awaiting results


The current Phase II/III study is set up identically to Alcobra's 120-patient Phase IIb
study. The study is a 300-patient, randomized, placebo-controlled trial being conducted
at 20 sites in the United States and Israel. Patients were randomized to receive either
1400 mg MDX or placebo over 6 weeks following a 2 week screening period.


Like in Phase IIb study, the primary endpoint is the CAARS-INV score. The secondary
endpoints include the TOVA score, improvement from baseline in CGI-I AND CGI-S
(CGI Severity Scale), AAGoL and additional exploratory endpoints.

The most important secondary endpoint is the change in CAARS-INV score in adults
with ADHD-PI. Based on MDX's performance in ADHD-PI patients in Phase IIb study, an
agreement has been reached with the FDA which ensured that at least 33% of the
patients in the current study will be ADHD-PI. The latest figure reported by the company
is 41%.


On September 19 2014, Alcobra has announced that all scheduled follow-up visits have
been completed for patients enrolled in the company's ongoing study, and that database
lock and topline statistical analysis will be reported within approximately two weeks. This
means that we can expect results to be announced within a few days.


Why the ongoing Phase II/III study is likely to fail the primary endpoint


So far, MDX has been administered to no more than 100 adults with ADHD, considering
that half of all major trial patients were taking placebo. In addition, all of Alcobra's clinical
studies were performed in only two medical centers in Israel, suggesting that the treated
population was relatively homogeneous. The small and uniform patient sample has
masked the drug's lack of efficacy on 60% of all the patients enrolled in Alcobra's trials
to date. Generally, when hidden drawbacks exist in clinical trials, they tend to emerge as
patient samples scale up, and in Alcobra's case this will be exacerbated by the big
increase in patient heterogeneity related to the multiple US study sites.


Assuming that MDX will continue to exhibit no, or minimal, effect on the ADHD-CT
patient group, another realistic threat to the drug's performance is the lack of uncertainty
at the performance of placebo. As in any study endpoint that relies on questionnaires,
and more profoundly in CNS-related indications, placebo response tends to be affected
by subjective parameters.


Alcobra's current phase II/III study has 3 possible outcomes:


1. Complete failure - in both the primary and major secondary endpoints. We see this
possibility as very unlikely, as MDX seems to be a good ADHD-PI drug and is not likely
to fail the ADHD-PI sub-population endpoint.


2. Complete success - in all the primary and major secondary endpoints. We see this
scenario as less likely (~20% probability), as explained above.

3. Partial success - missing the primary endpoint and hitting the ADHD-PI endpoint. In
our view, this is the most probable scenario (~80% probability). We expect ADHD to be
trading at -30-50% following such result.


Proposed trading strategy


Based on our expectations for a partial success in the outcome of the results, we feel
that trading the options offers an extremely attractive opportunity to take advantage of
the high volatility. With the ATM Straddle selling for more than a 70% move, the options
are pricing two extreme scenarios which we believe will not materialize. One is a major
crash following a complete failure in both endpoints, we explain above why this is
extremely unlikely and hence offers a great opportunity to sell OTM puts, with a volatility
approaching 400%. The second is a complete success in the trial, reaching stat sig
figures for the entire population, which we believe to be an unlikely event, albeit a bit
more probable then a complete failure. With volatility at 350% in the OTM calls, we see
a rare opportunity to implement a short strangle strategy, where we sell OTM calls, and
match that with selling OTM puts. This will give us the sufficient "cushion" to withstand
even an aggressive move in the stock price, in the unlikely case we are wrong with our
predictions.
