Kornit Digital: Inkjet Printer Company Attempting To Trade At 3D
Printer Valuation, Riddled With Risk
Jul. 6, 2015 4:25 PM ET2 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Misunderstood hype - Due to analyst hype, market erroneously believes inkjet
printer Kornit is a 3D printing company, and has assigned a correspondingly
ridiculous valuation - one Kornit can't grow into.


Not 3D - Using a commercially available printer head and boasting just ~7 patents,
Kornit printers lack a legitimate reason to possibly justify any comparison to 3D
printers.


Overvalued - Kornit trades at an outlandish 50 times EBITDA and ~68 times
earnings. Both are close to 10 times pricier than comparable companies.


Dilution appears imminent - A September stock lockup expiration poised to release
millions of shares onto the market.


$6 target price – At ~$13 a share, creating a $387 million market cap for a company
with just $4.6 million in the bank, a capital raise makes sense now.


Israeli printer company Kornit Digital (NASDAQ:KRNT) swung into the inkjet printing
jungle as a $16 million acquisition that went public last April. In the shifting eyes of the
market, it grew up almost overnight into a nearly half-a-billion dollar beast.


But, with fangs bared, a snarling threat lies in wait for Kornit shareholders. The market has
been led to misunderstand Kornit's true business.


Kornit is a small manufacturer of inkjet printers used to print images and designs directly
onto T-shirts and other garments.


Yet the market has slapped a nearly $400 million valuation on this small inkjet printer
company that last quarter posted just $17.6 million revenue and a $200,000 net loss.
Why?


"You wouldn't be able to IPO a $16 million company at huge valuation if you didn't throw
out some nice buzz words," an analyst told TheStreetSweeper.

The buzz word is 3D printers. Some analysts have compared Kornit with 3D printer
companies, prompting widespread misunderstanding and baseless exuberance about
Kornit's potential.


The company hasn't responded to a request for comment. So, while investors may find
other viewpoints here, below is an executive summary of why we think Kornit is one of the
worst creatures in the jungle. Then we'll move on to our key points.


Executive Summary


Misunderstood Hype - Due to analyst hype, the market erroneously believes inkjet
printer Kornit is a 3D printing company and has assigned a correspondingly ridiculous
valuation - a valuation we believe Kornit cannot possibly grow into.
Not 3D - Using a commercially available printer head and boasting just ~7 patents,
Kornit printers lack the "specialness" to possibly justify any comparison to 3D printers.
Overvalued - Kornit trades at an outlandish 50 times EBITDA and ~68 times earnings.
Both are close to 10 times pricier than comparable companies.
Killer Competitors - Gorilla rivals such as Aeoon, Brother (OTCPK:BRTHY), Epson and
many others are stomping Kornit in the direct-to-garment area that serves custom T-
shirt companies. Kornit's signature "Breeze" printer costs twice as much as a top rival's
and prints on about the same number of T-shirts per hour.
Late To Market - Kornit wants to pursue roll-to-roll (R2R) printing on fabric, but four
years after introducing its Allegro solution, the commercial launch may still be 18
months out. Worse, a sole supplier issue could threaten both direct-to-garment and
roll-to-roll products. Meanwhile, Dover, Durst and Konica Minolta are dominating this
area.
Dilution Appears Imminent - Kornit will likely lose significant ground even before the
September stock lockup expiration, potentially unleashing millions of shares onto the
market. See "Final Bone-Crusher: Stock Overhang" below to get the overhang details.
A controlling shareholder could cash in essentially a pennies-on-the-dollar transaction
at current stock prices.
$6 Target Price - At ~$13 a share, creating a $387 million market cap for a company
with a pathetic $4.6 million in the bank, it only makes sense for Kornit to fill its money
chest with capital raised now. So we expect the stock will drop off the cliff to ~$6 a
share. And even that is extremely generous.


The Buzz Word

3D printing has been a big buzz word lately on Wall Street. 3D printers, sometimes called
additive printers, incorporate a layer-by-layer process of creating small-scale, three-
dimensional objects.


Real 3D printer companies have taken investors on a spectacular ride over the past
couple of years, sometimes dumping them on their heads as we warned on Aug. 28, 2013
about ExOne Co. ((NASDAQ:XONE) then ~$70, now ~$10). But people like to remember
the times the stock prices have blown out the roof.


That's why some institutional analysts try to justify Kornit's lofty valuation by comping it to
3D printers.


We think the comparisons are unwarranted but also note that the real 3D printing
companies, such as 3D Systems (NYSE:DDD), Stratasys (NASDAQ:SSYS) and XONE,
all of which bullish analysts/underwriters compared to Kornit, have been beaten up in the
last three months. See below.

Indeed, we agree with an analyst who has studied Kornit at length.


"They're pumping this in the 3D printing space. This is not a 3D printer," he said. "This is a
T-shirt inkjet printer company."


That "Specialness" Factor, Real Competitive Advantage Is Lacking

Attaching the buzz word to this T-shirt printer company is wrong on many levels.


Kornit has only about seven issued patents on products (though an unspecified number of
patents apparently came from the January acquisition of an ink maker). 3D Systems holds
1,061 US patents.


While the real 3D printer also offers proprietary print equipment, Kornit's tiny line of patent
protection doesn't extend to the most important part of a printer - the print head. Rather
than offering a proprietary print head that would differentiate it from the competition, Kornit
is dependent upon a head by FujiFilm that any company could buy and snap onto its own
machines. Similarly for ink. See below.


"The print heads for our systems are supplied by a sole supplier, FujiFilm Dimatix, Inc.,
or FDMX. We entered into an agreement with FDMX in 2006, pursuant to which FDMX
sells us certain off-the-shelf print heads and additional products, including ink, all of
which FDMX regularly sells to providers of inkjet systems."


And the supplier has already threatened to stop making the print head.


"FDMX has from time to time indicated that it may discontinue manufacturing the
print head that we currently source from it and use in our systems, although it has never
provided notice that it is actually doing so."


This is a major risk today. And therein lies another, possibly even more alarming, risk to
Kornit successfully executing on its business plan.


Late To Market: Kornit Hobbled In Pursuit of Roll-to-Roll


Traditional screen-print analog companies and other competitors have claimed much of
the direct-to-garment market that targets small business owners such as T-shirt makers.


Such customers often find it easier to justify Epson's entry-level F2000 than Kornit's entry-
level Breeze.


Epson prints 27-49 garments/hour, costs ~$17,000.

Kornit Breeze prints 25-40 garments/hour, costs ~ $69,000.


Indeed, Kornit's 1,200 installed printers have captured only about 3.4 percent of the direct-
to-garment market.


So the business plan envisions a launch into roll-to-roll (R2R) printing on fabric designed
for mass producers.


In roll-to-roll, big rolls of fabric go through the printer which prints images and patterns on
the cloth. The fabric is then sewn into clothing, furniture coverings, wallpaper, etc.


Three big issues pop up for Kornit in roll-to-roll.


First, this higher-volume market requires a good, solid print head even as the sole supplier
threatens to stop making the print heads used by Kornit.


Second, investors and bullish analysts may be missing the fact that Kornit launched its
larger scale printer Allegro at ITMA 2011 - four long years ago.


While analysts' bullish 2016 estimates rest heavily on Allegro succeeding, the company
said in April that it doesn't anticipate a commercial launch until sometime in the next 18
months. The Vulcan, a model hoped to address the mass production screen-print market,
is expected about two years out.

Indeed, if the supplier follows through and discontinues the print head, Kornit would have
to find a substitute and its launch would be significantly delayed beyond the apparent
target introduction in the fall of 2017 (obviously providing no significant 2016 revenue and
likely falling short of providing 10-15 percent of revenue that some analysts hope for in
2017).


And particularly with uncertainty surrounding Kornit's print head, it's anybody's guess
whether the quality, quantity and timing will all come together to the roll-to-roll market's
satisfaction.


Third, while Allegro and Vulcan are struggling to get to their feet and join the herd, well-
established companies such as Dover, Durst, Konica and Reggiani have already claimed
most of this mature market.


So Kornit's growth plan looks troubled.


Product Distribution Risks


As Kornit tries to outrun supplier risks and other perils, yet another snake is curled up in
the treetops, glaring down at the company. Its name is distribution.


Kornit operates through both indirect and direct sales of its products manufactured at the
fringes of the Gaza strip, relying primarily on distributors.


The problem is the company's two chief independent distributors, Hirsch International
(which accounts for 25% of revenue) and SPSI, hold non-exclusive, short-term contracts
with Kornit.


Hirsch sells Kornit printers but also sells a full line of MHM screen printing machines.
Screen printing is traditional in T-shirt shops and MHM has installed 15,000 machines -
more than 10 times the number installed by Kornit.


SPSI distributes Kornit but also sells the popular FreeJet digital printer for ~$22,000 vs.
Kornit's $69,000 Breeze digital printer.


Unfortunately, the really large direct-to-garment distributors Stahls and EquipmentZone
work with Epson rather than Kornit.


But beyond the obvious threats to Kornit's small distributorship channel, there's a related
issue aiming to strike …

That issue is the patent infringement lawsuit filed by Digital Imaging Systems. DIS filed
against Hirsch, alleging Kornit's distributor is infringing on its patent by selling Kornit
Breeze machines.


Kornit may be downplaying the issue, saying after getting a letter claiming patent
infringement from DIS, the company hadn't heard from DIS again since January 2005. But
the battle is very much alive because just last week, on June 29, 2015, DIS filed papers
opposing Hirsch's request to dismiss the lawsuit:

At best, the lawsuit is poised to gobble Kornit's money and attention as it backs and
possibly indemnifies its distributor. At worst, the lawsuit could kill Kornit's major distribution
channel and the Breeze itself.


Kornit Overvalued Compared To Gorilla Competitors

So we see that Kornit currently vies for business within a forest populated by huge, teeth-
baring, chest-thumping competitors. Private company Aeoon Technologies, plus public
companies Brother Industries and Seiko Epson (OTCPK:SEKEY) are among the
ecosystem's rulers.


Yet, apparently attracted by revenue growth and a misunderstanding of the threats and
actual comps, the market is willing to peel off many times more investment dollars per
various metrics for Kornit than for established, stable players. Kornit is trading around 50
times EBITDA while analysts tell we that peers are trading under five times EBITDA.


Price/earnings for Kornit is about 8-10 times higher than for its rivals. Check out the chart
below.


(Source: Yahoo Finance here, here, here)


The combined factors including Kornit's low operating margins - just 5.76 and 8.04 in the
last two quarters - suggest the company will not grow into its valuation.


Final Bone-Crusher: Stock Overhang


Since Kornit is fresh from its initial public offering, a potential bone-crushing event lurks
just around the corner for current shareholders. Some 21.3 million shares will be eligible
for trade when the lockup releases in a couple of months, though 16.5 million of those
shares are subject to volume or other restrictions.


So, a total of ~ 5 million shares or more could initially slam the market on Sept. 28.
