China Sky’s Defense: NASDAQ. NASDAQ’s
Response: No Comment.


Posted on April 23, 2009 by Asensio.com


China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued a press release


on April 21st responding to criticisms made by “short selling


advisors.” Though China Sky’s release does not mention


asensio.com, it seems that the release is directed at the


asensio.com’s reports on China Sky’s many problems, including


questions about the quality of its earnings, inconsistent figures for


its gross margins and average selling prices, its history of four


auditors in three years with each having been cited for deficiencies,


and the problematic appointment of a 25 year-old to serve on the


audit committee of the company’s board of directors, among other


issues.


The China Sky release states, “The Company stands by its full year


basic earnings per share figures as represented on its April 15, 2009,


earnings press release and filed in its Form 10-K.” What is odd in


this statement is the company’s qualification that it “stands by” the


full-year basic EPS figures. Why would the company say that it


“stands by” one set of highly specific figures and not all the others?


Is this another mistake? Or is the company using a sleight-of-hand


to try to keep investors happy?


Surely a self-described “leading fully integrated pharmaceutical


company” that is admittedly the questionable product of a shell deal


and PIPE financing, which included several serial penny-stock


promoters, can create a fuller, more detailed explanation of its


accounting.


The China Sky release also notes that “the reports question the


Company’s ability to generate consistent gross margin, especially in


light of volatile selling prices for certain products.” But the release


does not give a full explanation for the irregularity of the average

sales prices and the margins. The release states, “This reports [sic]


failed to note that overall average selling prices did not exhibit the


same level of volatility, due to changes in the Company’s diverse


mix of 97 products, the growing contribution of new biochemical


products and the discontinuation of lower priced contract


products.”


China Sky’s “overall average selling prices” statement is not clear.


Average sales prices are typically only referred to for specific


products.


China Sky fails to explain how a material amount of its sales can


experience drastic changes in sales price, while overall gross


margins remain constant.


China Sky’s release also did nothing to address the company’s


selection of auditors, and why they chose their current auditor, a


firm subject to an SEC sanction and a PCAOB inspection finding


significant audit deficiencies. In 2007 alone, China Sky had three


auditors at different times.


China Sky states, “The Company meets all corporate governance


standards required by the NASDAQ stock market, including a board


with a majority of independent directors and the establishment of


audit, compensation and corporate governance and nominating


committees.” While this is a nice statement, there are certain


problems with China Sky’s supposed compliance. For instance, one


of its independent directors was only 25 years old when elected last


year, and serves on the company’s audit committee as a “financial


expert.”


NASDAQ public relations was contacted on China Sky’s NASDAQ


claim. NASDAQ declined to provide an official response to China


Sky’s invoking its NASDAQ listing to defend the quality of its


earnings and corporate governance. A NASDAQ listing qualification


official stated, “NASDAQ does not publicly disclose regulatory


communication with its listed companies.”


Though China Sky is apparently keen to appear that they are


defending their corporate governance, they need much more of a


defense than a reference to NASDAQ compliance, which can’t be


verified.
