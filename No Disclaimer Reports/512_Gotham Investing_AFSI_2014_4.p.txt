Questions For AmTrust's Q3 Earnings Call
Nov. 3, 2014 2:50 PM ET13 comments
by: Gotham Investing


Summary


AFSI's accounting appears questionable in a number of areas.


Only sell-side analysts can ask the company questions on the earnings call.


Pressing questions about the reliability of AFSI's accounting need answering.


Preface


AmTrust Financial Services, Inc. (NASDAQ:AFSI) reports earnings on Tuesday morning,
but the Company only takes questions from sell-side analysts on its earnings calls. As
such, I have created a list of questions I suggest analysts ask (or that the Company
answers proactively).


I believe investors deserve to hear the Company address these questions publicly rather
than through sell-side analyst reports, because reported results of "operating earnings"
are meaningless when the veracity of a company's accounting is in question.


Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives ("LRCs")


1) Will the Company provide reconciliations of its premiums earned and loss & loss
adjustment expenses incurred showing the amount of gross, ceded to other AFSI
subsidiaries, ceded to third-parties, and net for each of its insurance subsidiaries?


Note: To-date, AFSI has only described the transactions and stated that it has
"appropriately" consolidated its wholly-owned Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives.


I believe this matter can only be put to rest by the Company providing reconciliations for
2008-2013 (2008 being the last year prior to its first acquisition of a Luxembourg
Reinsurance Captive). This should be a simple exercise for the Company, and the
disclosures would provide great clarity for investors regarding an issue that is relatively
unique to AFSI without impairing AFSI's competitive position.


2) Why did the Schedule Y, Part 2, column 9 show income of $18.5 million for AmTrust Re
Theta (f.k.a. SoCare Re; changed name in December 2012), when Mr. Zyskind specifically
said this entity had $58 million in net losses resulting from stop-loss agreements with

AmTrust International Insurance, Ltd. ("AII") on the Q4'13 earnings call?


Maiden Discrepancies


3) As of December 31, 2013, what amount of loss reserves and unearned premiums
ceded to Maiden Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ:MHLD) did not require collateralization?


4) Why do the financial statements for AFSI and MHLD imply different amounts for loss
and loss adjustment expenses paid by MHLD to AFSI?


Note: Through 2013, AFSI reported having ceded $2,472.3 million of loss and loss
adjustment expenses to MHLD, and claimed reinsurance recoverables of $1,144.2 million,
implying a cumulative paid amount of $1,328.1 million.


In contrast, MHLD reported having assumed $2,287.6 million of loss and loss adjustment
expenses from AFSI ($184.7 million less than AFSI claims to have ceded MHLD), and
reported loss and loss adjustment expense reserves of $796.0 million ($348.2 million less
than AFSI claims in reinsurance recoverables. Adjusting for the $108 million classification
difference noted in AFSI's "Response to Barron's" (leaving a still substantial $240.2 million
difference in reinsurance recoverables/loss and loss adjustment expense reserves),
MHLD's financial statements imply a cumulative paid amount of $1,383.6 million - $55.5
million higher than AFSI's report of paid.


Loss Ratio & Reserves


5) How does one reconcile the 83.5% net loss ratio for accident year 2013 reported in the
TIC & Affiliates Annual Combined Statement and the $30.9 million of net adverse
development (10-K, page 18) with the 67.0% net loss ratio reported in AFSI's 10-K?


Note: Small Commercial (100% U.S.) had a loss ratio of 65.8%; Specialty Program (100%
U.S.) had a loss ratio of 68.2%; Personal Lines Re (100% U.S.) had a loss ratio of 68.2%;
Specialty Risk & Extended Warranty had a loss ratio of 67.2% (<50% U.S.).


Conditions of New York Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") Approval of
ACP Re's Acquisition of Tower Group International, Ltd. (NASDAQ:TWGP)


6) In light of the 3:1 net premiums written to surplus ratio agreed upon with the NYDFS,
what is the current net premiums written to surplus as the NYDFS will measure it (please
specify if measurement is other than U.S. SAP)? If below 3:1, why was the condition "[f]or
the year ending December 31, 2015"?


Note: One would expect the condition to be immediate if it was not a binding constraint.
