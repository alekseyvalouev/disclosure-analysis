Tekmira Pharmaceuticals: Spinning Its Next 'Big Story'
Jan. 22, 2015 2:57 PM ET2 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


TKMR owes its high-flying ways last year to Ebola fears, heavy promotions - 10
separate TKMR reports in one day - and market misunderstanding about its product
and competitors.TKMR owes.


TKMR returns to chasing the next big biotech story, complete with pending
overvalued merger and this week's inconsequential announcement of a tiny Phase 1
clinical trial initiation.


The market has overlooked the heavy competition, extensive development timeline
and other substantial risks inherent in a merger that created an unbelievable
valuation approaching $1 billion.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Tekmira Pharmaceuticals (TKMR) may not have found its next big biotech thing, after all.


After a crazy-good run riding the Ebola scare from obscurity to prominence in just a few
months, the company found itself searching for something new to keep investors
interested. Tekmira's betting that hepatitis B will be it.


Shares of Canada-based Tekmira jumped from ~$15 to ~$24 earlier this month on news it
teamed up with OnCore BioPharma to work to develop a hepatitis B therapy.


Now, on Tekmira's recent tepid announcement of dosing one person in its tiny 20-patient
clinical trial, shares jumped 2.7% - far short of the long-gone Ebola gains of 280%-plus.


Indeed, Tekmira reminds us of another Ebola treatment-next-big-biotech-thing wannabe
that TheStreetSweeper warned investors about, iBio (then $1.88, now ~$0.52).


While other viewpoints about Tekmira are available HERE, let's look at some issues
surrounding Tekmira's latest, greatest target.


*EBOLA STORY CRUMPLES

With news reports on Ebola rampant and Tekmira promoters out in force, Tekmira shares
rocketed from about $19 on March 4 to about $28 on March 6 - the day a total of 10 stock
promoters reported on Tekmira.


In August, though, Tekmira's Ebola run slowed. News emerged that the government was
working with several companies on Ebola treatment, and had treated two Americans with
drugs made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical rather than Tekmira's treatment. Tekmira gave up
its recent massive gains and then some.


By early last October, with doubts growing about Tekmira's Ebola therapy, the stock
dropped to about $23 to $24. A Glaucus Research report in November on troubles ranging
from Tekmira's finances to misunderstanding of its Department of Defense contract rubbed
out several more bucks - plunging the price after several weeks to below $13.


It became clear that Tekmira needed to look for the next big biotech story.


Tekmira decided hepatitis B fit the bill. Tekmira and Oncore BioPharma want to eventually
combine several drugs in one pill to treat chronic hepatitis B.


THE TROUBLE WITH ONCORE


OnCore was started as an afterthought in 2012, after a co-founder had already sold off its
desirable product - a hepatitis C treatment.


OnCore bought its way into existence - in the risky rollup mode reminiscent of that
employed by Revolution Lighting ($5.19 before TheStreetSweeper's exposure, now $1.15)
Here's what OnCore did:


*September 2014, a deal to make $150 million in milestone payments, plus future royalties
on any future drug sales, for NeuroVive Pharmaceutical's hepatitis B drug candidate.


*October 2014, an undisclosed cash offer to buy Enantigen Therapeutics, the company
owned by the guys down the hall, who developed the experimental hepatitis B treatment.
Both OnCore and Enantigen are located in the Pennsylvania Biotechnology Center in
Doylestown, Pa.


*November 2014, a filing for an initial public offering that never happened.


So the situation comes down to Tekmira buying a company after it had already sold its big
idea and then paid mightily for other companies' ideas. We don't believe this merger target
can possibly be worth $400 million.

*TIME IS NOT ON THEIR SIDE


The biotech commercialization process is slow, frequently impeded by numerous failures
along the way. And Tekmira's progress has been even more agonizingly slow than most.
Since formation in 1992 , Tekmira has attempted to advance nine products.


Each must go through animal testing before Phase I to III human testing under the US
Food and Drug Administration's eyes before the company can even think about
commercialization. Tekmira says the three most advanced have reached only Phase II.


The Ebola treatment that prompted frenetic investing in Tekmira a few months ago is only
in Phase I.


But most products - five including another Ebola product - haven't even made it beyond
pre-clinical testing.


The recent Phase I clinical trial initiation promotion with OnCore handed Tekmira a
promotional tool but did little to improve the timeframe.


Tekmira still faces years of clinical trials and even then, certainly no sure shot at bringing
the treatment to market.


*MANAGER'S COMPANIES SUFFERING LOST VALUE


Considering the performance of companies lead by some Tekmira managers, we're
concerned Tekmira will not do much better.


Dr. Daniel Kisner, Tekmira's chairman, became an Lpath director in 2012, for example.
Charts below show how the biotech company net income and stock prices have fallen
since then. Net losses worsened to $7 million, while the stock lost over 80 percent of its
value.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2842036-tekmira-pharmaceuticals-spinning-its-next-big-story 4/7


Conatus Pharmaceuticals added Dr. Kisner to its board of directors Feb. 7, 2014. As the
chart below shows, CNAT fetched about $9-$12 then but has fallen to well under $6 now.
Piper Jaffray recently slashed the price target from $16 to $6 and downgraded Conatus to
"neutral," saying results of its Emricasan drug trials make future development of the drug
unclear. Conatus' history of negative earnings and zero revenue continues.


Tekmira CEO Mark Murray came on board 2008 through Tekmira's acquisition of the
company he founded in 2000, Protiva Biotherapeutics. Mr. Murray is well acquainted with
the distractions of legal challenges as both a plaintiff and defendant in lawsuits alleging

everything from intentional misrepresentation to fraud to allegations that Mr. Murray issued
a press release that accused


Alnylam (see an excellent summary here), of "stealing" technology rather than reaching an
agreement that had soured.


Before founding Protiva, Mr. Murray's experience included ZymoGenetics, now a Bristol-
Myers subsidiary, and Xcyte Therapies, acquired through reverse merger in 2006 by
Cyclacel Pharmaceuticals. The chart below indicates where that company with its
increasing losses now stands.


Tekmira's new chief financial officer, Bruce Cousins, worked four years as CFO for
Aspreva Pharmaceuticals until Galencia Group acquired it in 2008. But he devoted a year
or less to various companies, including solar power products company Carmanah, where
cranky major shareholders virtually tossed him out of his CEO position in June 2013. He
rebounded by saying he'd just take off on his boat. After floating around for four months,
he grabbed the job with Tekmira.


How did his former company do? Adjusted for a stock split, the stock rose from $1.17
during Mr. Cousin's tenure to a little over $3:

Mr. Cousins has also served as director of Alya Ventures, which merged with mobile
marketing technology company Snipp Interactive in 2011. The company stock now fetches
under 50 cents per share.


Mr. Cousins worked as a director for a Canadian drama queen, Med BioGene, from
August 2006 to November 2010. The money-losing company recently has been troubled
with a dissident shareholder that Med BioGene sniffed didn't have a plan any better than
its own. The dissident shareholder is now CEO.


Today, Med BioGene, focused on cancer testing, attracts few traders willing to risk a few
cents on a share, as shown by the Med BioGene chart.


CONCLUSION


So, it doesn't look good: Tekmira's habit of chasing its next big story, stock promotions,
management's experience with troubled companies and overvalued merger.


Considering the 50 percent Tekmira-OnCore stock arrangement, we were already asking
ourselves: How could this situation possibly create a company with a nearly $1 billion
valuation combined? No way. Tekmira's search for the next big thing will never cease until
shareholders run out of money.
