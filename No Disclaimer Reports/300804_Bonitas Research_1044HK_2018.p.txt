We are short Hengan because we believe Hengan has fabricated RMB 11 billion of net income since 


2005 which has manifested itself as fake cash on its balance sheet.  Laden with debt, we assert that 


Hengan’s equity is ultimately worthless. 
 


Hengan International Group Company Limited (HKEx: 1044) (the “Company” or “Hengan”) is best known for its “Space 7”, 


“Anerle” and “Anle” branded sanitary napkins (think maxipads) in China.  In a very saturated and commoditized industry, Hengan 


claimed to generate 51% operating margins for its sanitary napkin segment in 1H’18, while its competitors are striving to generate 


15% operating margins.  Hengan’s reported historical return on assets for its sanitary napkin segment are equally questionable, 


claiming to achieve a remarkable peak return on sanitary napkin assets of 72% in 2016! 





We believe the scheme was orchestrated using a web of inter-company related transactions to artificially inflate profits and conceal 


fake cash balances.  Despite boasting cash and bank balances of RMB 19.8 billion and a working capital balance of RMB 7.6 


billion as of June 30, 2018, Hengan has been aggressively raising debt to support its operations.  In the five months from August 


to December 2018, Hengan issued six separate tranches of debt to investors raising a total of RMB 7.5 billion with a majority of 


the proceeds earmarked for working capital!   





Characteristically with frauds, insiders create sham transactions with related parties to create illusory transaction volume, revenues, 


or profits depending on the fraudster’s desired outcome.  Often these sham transactions are only on paper, and the fabricated buying 


and selling activity appears on the balance sheets of the counterparties as receivables and/or payables.  We suspect this is how 


Hengan insiders have historically concealed dubious activity from auditors.  





The scheme’s orchestrators have already been handsomely rewarded with significant cash dividends.  Since 2005, Hengan has paid 


out RMB 18.6 billion in total dividends, which means at least ~RMB 7.8 billion has been pocketed by Hengan insiders from 


dividends.  Our research has uncovered an undisclosed nefarious disposal of a Hengan revenue stream to Hengan’s CEO’s private 


family business at the bargain basement price of 0.7x 2016 net income!  In addition, we found that Hengan’s insiders have 


undisclosed private businesses that claim to have transacted with Hengan on a Fujian real estate investment, increasing our 


suspicions that additional undisclosed benefits have been siphoned from Hengan to enrich insiders at the expense of investors.  





So how do investors value a public company operated by unscrupulous insiders who use inter-company sham transactions to 


generate and conceal fabricated profits and cash?  We think as long as Hengan’s insiders continue to be family relatives, Hengan’s 


cash and assets will be siphoned out to benefit insiders at the expense of creditors and shareholders.  And if Hengan’s operational 


control was to change, we suspect the new team would find Hengan’s books to consist of overstated growth rates and profitability 


coupled with highly overlevered inflated asset valuations.  





As this saga unwinds, we suspect defaults on debt covenants, increased costs of capital, increased leverage ratios, and 


reductions to dividend payments.  Considering Hengan’s June 30, 2018 short-term financial liabilities balance of RMB 17.8 


billion, and that Hengan raised additional short-term debts of RMB 7.5 billion in the last five months, we believe it is 


possible that creditors scramble to get repaid and settle debts for less than par value, leaving Hengan’s equity ultimately 


worthless…

1. FABRICATED SANITARY NAPKIN PROFITABILITY.  With over 2,000+ sanitary napkin brands in China, a developed 
online e-commerce market and few barriers to entry, sanitary napkins are a commodity widely available globally, including 


China.  We would expect this business to generate commodity operating profit margins, however Hengan somehow 


purportedly generated sanitary napkin operating margins of 51% in 1H’18!  We suspect that Hengan started fabricating its 


sanitary napkin segment profits in 2005, when, in the face of heavy competition, Hengan’s sanitary napkin segment 


profitability inexplicably spiked along with reported borrowings. We calculate that Hengan has fabricated RMB 9.4 billion 


of cumulative profits from its sanitary napkin segment since 2005. 





a. Inexplicable Difference In Segment Profitability Between Hengan China and Hengan.  Despite Hengan’s industry-
leading profitability, in just the last five months, Hengan China has issued six separate tranches of debt to investors 


raising a total of RMB 7.5 billion. We have reviewed Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses and believe that Hengan 


China’s reported performance supports our opinion that Hengan has significantly fabricated its reported sanitary napkin 


operating profit margins in its HKEx filings.    In its prospectuses, Hengan China disclosed that it generated an average 


~31% operating profit margins for its sanitary napkin segment, 1,215 to 1,477 basis points lower than what Hengan 


reported in its HKEx filings from 2015 to 2017. 





b. Hengan’s Deputy CFO Describes Sanitary Napkin Margins Consistent with Hengan China.  On November 3, 2018 
we spoke with Hengan’s Deputy CFO Martin Li Wai Leung (“Hengan’s Deputy CFO”), who also acts as Hengan’s 


Investor Relations, Hengan’s Board Secretary, Hengan’s Securities Representative, and Hengan China’s Supervisor. In 


an example given by Hengan’s Deputy CFO, he calculated that Hengan’s sanitary napkin operating profit margins were 


29%, in-line with Hengan China’s reported segment profit margins but significantly lower than the 51% reported by 


Hengan in its HKEx filings. 





c. Competitor Sanitary Napkin Operating Profit Margins Significantly Lower than Hengan.  Our call with a 
competing CFO who was familiar with the sanitary napkin industry in China described to us that a branded sanitary 


napkin manufacturer in China would strive to generate ~15-16% operating profit margins.  In 2018 and 2017, two of 


Hengan’s domestic sanitary napkin competitors, Kingdom Healthcare and Baiya, filed application proof prospectuses for 


listing on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-Share markets, respectively.   In 2017, Kingdom Healthcare achieved RMB 1.6 


billion in sanitary napkin sales while generating a 9.3% operating profit margin. In 2016, Baiya achieved RMB 546 


million in sanitary napkin sales while generating a 10.5% operating profit margin. 








2. FABRICATED BANK BALANCES.  Investors should be suspicious of companies that purportedly generate significant net 
income and boast large bank balances yet continue to rely heavily on short-term borrowings.  As of June 30, 2018, Hengan’s 


reported working capital balance was RMB 7.6 billion, near historical highs.  Yet despite Hengan’s reported working capital 


surplus, from August to December 2018 Hengan China issued six separate tranches of debt to investors raising a total of RMB 


7.5 billion with the majority of proceeds earmarked for working capital! We believe the real reason Hengan has recently 


increased its borrowings is because Hengan’s reported cash balance is fabricated.  We suspect that nearly all of Hengan’s 


short-term bank time deposits are fabricated.  We calculate that since 2009, Hengan has fabricated an additional RMB 1.6 


billion in interest income from fabricated short-term bank time deposits, bringing our calculation of total fabricated profits to 


RMB 11 billion. 








3. THE PAYOFF.  In our experience, the intent of most fraudsters is to enable insiders to egregiously benefit from the scam, 
ultimately at the expense of unsuspecting investors.  In the case of Hengan, we highlight oversized dividends financed by 


borrowings from third parties and undisclosed related party transactions involved in the construction and operation of a 


Hengan-funded non-core property in Fujian, China. 





a. RMB 7.8 Billion in Dividends.  The scheme’s orchestrators have already been handsomely rewarded with significant 
cash dividends.  Since 2005, Hengan has paid out RMB 18.6 billion in total dividends, which means Hengan insiders 


have pocketed ~RMB 7.8 billion in cash dividends so far. 





b. Insiders Benefit from Hengan Investment in Fujian Property.  We believe that Hengan lied to investors about the 
purchaser of a Hengan China subsidiary being independent, and that Hengan failed to disclose that the private family 


business of Hengan’s CEO was involved in the design, construction and operation of a property in Fujian, China. 


Specifically, Hengan insiders used Hengan’s cash investments in Fujian Xiamen Hengan International Plaza (“Xiamen 


Hengan Plaza”) to benefit the private family business of Hengan’s CEO without disclosing the relationship to insiders.  


Undisclosed benefits include cash from expenses and an illicit gain from the undisclosed related party purchase of a 


Hengan subsidiary receiving property management income for the bargain basement price of 0.7x 2016 net income.

FABRICATED SANITARY NAPKIN PROFITABILITY 





With over 2,000+ sanitary napkin brands in China, a developed online e-commerce market and few barriers to entry, 


sanitary napkins are a commodity widely available globally, including China.  We would expect this business to 


generate commodity operating profit margins, however Hengan somehow purportedly generated sanitary napkin 


operating profit margins of 51% in 1H’18!   Ultimately, we believe that Hengan’s reported sanitary napkin operating 


profit margins are fabricated. 





Hengan was established in 1985 to produce sanitary napkins, a time when the PRC market penetration rate for sanitary 


napkins was just 2%. By 1997, PRC market penetration was 41.8%, and Hengan was benefitting from its leading 


market position as the largest sanitary napkin producer in China.  At that time, Hengan reported that 96% of its sales 


were from sanitary napkins.1 





 
Source: Hengan Global Offering – p. 33 


http://www.irasia.com/listco/hk/hengan/prospectus/placing.pdf  





By 1998, Hengan was already describing the market for its sanitary napkins as “very competitive”, competing with 


international brands from companies such as Procter & Gamble (NYSE: PG), Kimberly-Clark (NYSE: KMB), Kao 


Corp. (JP: 4452) and Johnson and Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) for PRC market share.   





 
Source: Hengan Global Offering – p. 15 


http://www.irasia.com/listco/hk/hengan/prospectus/placing.pdf  





By 2004, Hengan disclosed that “the penetration rate of the mainland China sanitary napkins market exceeded 60% 


and started to enter into a mature stage”.2 In 2004, Hengan reported sanitary napkin revenue growth of 1.4% yr/yr, 


with 71% of its sanitary napkin segment sales coming from Hengan’s higher margin “Anerle” brand and generated a 


sanitary napkin segment operating profit margin of 23.9%.

The next two years were tough for sanitary napkin producers. In 2005 and 2006, Hengan disclosed that increased 


competition and higher raw material costs resulted in many small and medium-sized manufacturers to go out of 


business and cease production.  With increased competition and increased raw material costs, we would expect to see 


operating profit margins contract, not expand.  Yet, despite these competitive market dynamics, from 2004 to 2006 


Hengan purportedly improved its sanitary napkin segment operating profit margins by 1,226 basis points from 23.9% 


to 36.1%. 





The below chart illustrates that despite competitive market dynamics limiting the growth of operating profit margins 


in Hengan’s other commodity business segments (namely tissue paper and disposable diapers), Hengan’s sanitary 


napkin segment operating profit margins remained immune to market pressures, recording peak operating profit 


margins of 51% in 1H’18!  We think Hengan’s reported sanitary napkin operating profit margins are simply too good 


to be true. 





 
Source: Hengan Annual Reports 2004 - 2017 








Hengan’s reported historical return on assets for its sanitary napkin segment are equally questionable, claiming to 


achieve a peak return on sanitary napkin assets of 72% in 2016!

In this report we present evidence that supports our opinion that Hengan has fabricated RMB 11 billion of net income 


since 2005 which has manifested itself as fake cash on its balance sheet.  We have formulated our opinion on Hengan 


from our review of the following documents: 





• 47 annual SAIC filings and 36 annual credit reports of Hengan’s subsidiaries (CHINESE) 


• 9 Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses filed from 2016 through December 2018 (CHINESE)

a) Inexplicable Difference in Segment Profitability Between Hengan China and Hengan 
 


Since 2016, Hengan (China) Investment Co. Ltd. (“Hengan China”), Hengan’s largest primary subsidiary, has filed a 


total of 8 bond prospectuses (collectively “Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses”).  Despite Hengan’s industry-leading 


profitability, in just the last five months, Hengan China has issued six separate tranches of debt to investors raising a 


total of RMB 7.5 billion. 





We have reviewed Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses and believe that Hengan China’s reported performance 


supports our opinion that Hengan has significantly fabricated its reported sanitary napkin operating profit margins in 


its HKEx filings.   





From 2013 to 2017, Hengan China’s reported total sales and segment sales figures matched what Hengan reported in 


its HKEx filings.   





 
Source: Hengan China Bond Prospectus, Hengan Annual Reports 


*Note: Hengan 2013 and 2014 Total Revenues exclude food and snack business segment 





Hengan China’s tissue paper and disposable diaper segment operating profit margins match figures reported by 


Hengan.  As such, we would expect Hengan China to report sanitary napkin operating profit margins that match what 


Hengan reported in its HKEx filings. This is not the case. 





While Hengan China’s tissue paper and disposable diaper segment profit margins match figures reported by Hengan, 


Hengan China’s sanitary napkin operating profit margins are significantly lower than what Hengan reported 


in its HKEx filings.

Specifically, Hengan China disclosed that it generated on average ~31% operating profit margins for its sanitary 


napkin segment, 1,215 to 1,477 basis points lower than what Hengan reported in its HKEx filings from 2015 to 2017. 





Again, it is important to note that this large discrepancy between reported segment profit of Hengan China and Hengan 


is only present in its sanitary napkin segment and not in its tissue paper or disposable diaper segment!

How can this be?  What is the reason for such a significant discrepancy in reported profitability? 





We analyzed inter-company transactions disclosed by Hengan China to try and identify the large discrepancy between 


Hengan China and Hengan’s reported sanitary napkin segment profits.  Hengan China disclosed that it made purchases 


from a total of 10 different Hengan entities not consolidated by Hengan China (“Other Hengan Subs”).  A review of 


the PRC filings for the 7 PRC-based Other Hengan Subs (“Other Hengan PRC Subs”) reveals that Hengan China’s 


purchases accounted for 96% to 98% of total revenues generated by the Other Hengan PRC Subs from 2015 to 2017, 


suggesting to us that Hengan China is almost exclusively the source of revenue for Other Hengan PRC Subs.

Characteristically with frauds, insiders create sham transactions with related parties to create illusory transaction 


volume, revenues, or profits depending on the fraudster’s desired outcome.  Often these sham transactions are only on 


paper, and the fabricated buying and selling activity appears on the balance sheets of the counterparties as receivables 


and/or payables. 





Fujian Hengan Holding Co., Ltd. (“Hengan Holding”) has more inter-company transaction volume with Hengan China 


than any Other Hengan PRC Subs.  Detailed credit reports for Hengan Holding from 2014 to 2017 reveal large changes 


in receivables and payables balances, with both line items oddly having negative balances in 2017. 





 
Source: 2014 to 2017 Hengan Holding Credit Reports 





We rarely come across any operating businesses with negative receivable and negative payable balances.  However, 


considering Hengan Holding’s only counterparty is Hengan China, we surmise that Hengan Holding’s odd balances 


are a byproduct of its inter-company sham transactions with Hengan China.   





Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses disclosed that in 2017 Fujian Hengan Holding Xiamen Business Trade Co., Ltd. 


(“Xiamen Trading”) was the largest revenue generating Hengan China subsidiary.  Hengan China’s reported non-


consolidated 2017 gross revenues of RMB 43 billion while reporting Xiamen Trading’s revenues of RMB 23.6 billion.  


To us, this suggests that Xiamen Trading transacts with Other Hengan Subs, then sells to other Hengan China 


subsidiaries, creating inter-company sham transactions to fabricate profits and balance its books. 





Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses disclosed that in 2015 and 2016 Xiamen Trading had limited revenues and 


maintained relatively consistent asset and liability balances.  Then suddenly in 2017 Xiamen Trading’s revenues 


increased 6,600% to RMB 23.6 billion while its asset and liabilities increased 400% to ~RMB 12 billion.  We believe 


Xiamen Trading’s sudden increase in activity is a result of fabricated inter-company transactions with Other Hengan 


Subs, while the sham transactions manifested as phantom receivables and payables on Xiamen Trading’s balance 


sheet.

Hengan China Subs Balance Sheet

We note that Xiamen Trading’s SAIC filings are inconsistent with Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses.  While Xiamen 


Trading’s SAIC filings disclose revenues of RMB 21+ billion each year from 2015 to 2017, Hengan China’s Bond 


Prospectuses disclose Xiamen Trading generated revenues of RMB 1.3 billion and RMB 265 million in 2015 and the 


first 9mo2016, respectively.  We attribute this discrepancy to the inconsistent reporting by management in attempts to 


conceal the sham transactions.

Additionally, Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses disclosed that both Xiamen Trading’s assets and liabilities suddenly 


increased 400%+ to RMB 12.5 billion and RMB 12.3 billion as of FYE’17, respectively.  However, Xiamen Trading 


SAIC filings reveal that Xiamen Trading’s assets and liabilities were 71% and 74% lower in 2017 as compared to 


disclosure in Hengan China’s Bond Prospectus.  Xiamen Trading’s SAIC balance sheet has historically been 


dominated by other receivables and payables with limited cash and inventory balances, which to us corroborates our 


opinion that Xiamen Trading has been used by Hengan to fabricate inter-company sham transactions meant to 


artificially inflate Hengan’s reported profitability. 





 
Source: Xiamen Trading SAIC Filings 





We think the timing of Xiamen Trading’s sudden financial activity increase in 2017 is no coincidence.  Rather, we 


attribute these reported figures to the “cleaning up” of fabricated transactions from the newly appointed insider CFO, 


Mr. Xu Da Zuo on November 30, 2016.   





Mr. Xu Da Zuo joined Hengan 33 years ago (since est. 1985) at the age of 18.  Mr. Xu Da Zuo is the brother of 


Hengan’s COO, Mr. Xu Shui Shen, who also joined Hengan 33 years ago (since est. 1985) at the age of 15.  Both Xu 


brothers are cousins of Hengan CEO Mr. Hui Lin Chit (“Hengan CEO”).  To us, this certainly seems more like a 


family business than a public company. 





Sanitary napkins are a commodity good.  Hengan China disclosed that it generated on average ~31% operating profit 


margins for its sanitary napkin segment, 1,215 to 1,477 basis points lower than what Hengan reported in its HKEx 


filings from 2015 to 2017. Credit Reports and SAIC filings for Hengan Holding and Xiamen Trading disclose 


inexplicable discrepancies in the financial performance reported by Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses, suggesting 


that Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses may still be overstating Hengan’s actual profitability.

b) Hengan’s Deputy CFO Describes Sanitary Napkin Margins Consistent with Hengan China 
 


On November 3, 2018 we spoke with Hengan’s Deputy CFO Martin Li Wai Leung (“Hengan’s Deputy CFO”), who 


also acts as Hengan’s Investor Relations, Hengan’s Board Secretary, Hengan’s Securities Representative, and Hengan 


China’s Supervisor.3

We asked Hengan’s Deputy CFO the reasons for the reported discrepancy between Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses 


and Hengan’s HKEx financial performance.   





Hengan’s Deputy CFO was not aware of what was reported in the Hengan China Bond Prospectuses but assured us 


that the figures should match Hengan’s reported sanitary napkin segment results in its HKEx filings (~70% gross 


margin, ~50% operating profit margin).  





We pressed our questions further, asking specifically about the breakdown of Hengan’s sanitary napkin margin profile.  


To our surprise, Hengan’s Deputy CFO clearly described to us that sanitary napkin operating profit margins are in-


line with sanitary napkin operating profit margins disclosed in Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses.  In an example 


given by Hengan’s Deputy CFO, he calculated that Hengan’s sanitary napkin operating profit margins were 29%, 


significantly lower than the 51% reported by Hengan in its HKEx filings.

Excerpt from Call With Hengan’s Deputy CFO 





Question: “I'm aware the gross margins in [your sanitary napkin’s] business is high, and 


I'm aware that you guys have a really good distribution network. Could you give me, if a customer 


was buying a packet of Space 7 for RMB 100, could you give me the [margin] breakdown? How 


much is taxed, how much is to the distributor, how much is to the supermarket, how much do you 


spend on marketing? Could you kind of give me, just so we can understand the value chain, who 


makes what along the chain? Because your gross margins are big, but I assume your operating 


profit margins are not as big?” 





Hengan’s Deputy CFO Answer: “If the retail price is 100…  So for example, if I produce $10 


which is the production cost or the production price for my Space 7. On every part I will add roughly 


20 to 30 percent markup in order-- before I go to the retailer. So that is, for example, my cost is 


$10, then I will, talking about, I will sell it $12 to my sales team. And then my sales team will then 


sell to around $14 roughly to the distributors. And the distributors will then further sell around $18, 


or so $20 to the retailers. And the retailers will then add further 20%, talking about maybe, talking 


about, $24 to the customers. So that is the case like this.

We believe that both the Hengan China Bond Prospectuses and the example given by Hengan’s Deputy CFO discredit 


Hengan’s reported 51% sanitary napkin segment operating profit margins in 1H’18.   However, considering the 


contradictory descriptions given by Hengan’s Deputy CFO and the discrepancies in SAIC filings for Hengan’s PRC 


subsidiaries compared to what was reported in Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses, we suspect that Hengan’s actual 


sanitary napkin segment operating profit margins are lower than 29%.

c) Competitor Sanitary Napkin Operating Profit Margins Significantly Lower than Hengan 
 


As part of our due diligence process, we spoke with third-party industry participants to better understand the 


competitive landscape of the sanitary napkin market in China.  Our call with a competing CFO who was familiar with 


the sanitary napkin industry in China described to us that a branded sanitary napkin manufacturer in China would 


strive to generate ~15-16% operating profit margins, significantly lower than the sanitary napkin segment operating 


profit margins reported in Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses. 





We asked the competing CFO to break down the value chain for sanitary napkin market participants and estimate 


optimal margin profiles for each different business.  The competing CFO estimated at best 5% operating profit margin 


for an OEM producer, and another 10% at best for participants not involved in production, instead exclusively involved 


with the marketing and branding of sanitary napkins.  Adding both margins together suggests that optimal sanitary 


napkin segment operating profit margins are ~15-16%.   





When the competing CFO walked us through his value chain breakdown for the margin profile of a RMB 100 retail 


priced sanitary napkin packet, the competing CFO calculated 16% operating profit margin for a branded manufacturer 


like Hengan.  


 
Source: Due Diligence Call October 31, 2018 





The competing CFO estimated in two separate value chain calculation examples that optimal operating profit margins 


for a sanitary napkin manufacturer and vendor would be ~15-16%.   





In 2018 and 2017, two of Hengan’s domestic sanitary napkin competitors, Kingdom Healthcare Holdings Limited, 


Guangdong (“Kingdom Healthcare”) and Chongqing Baiya Sanitary Products Co., Ltd. (“Baiya”), separately filed 


application proof prospectuses for listing on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A-Share markets, respectively.    





Kingdom Healthcare is an ODM manufacturer of sanitary napkins, adding value via branding, packaging and design

While Hengan purportedly generated 51% sanitary napkin segment operating profit margins in 1H’18, Hengan’s 


Deputy CFO and Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses disclose that sanitary napkin segment operating profit margins 


should be more in the ~28-33% range.  A competing CFO described an optimal operating profit margin profile of ~15-


16% for a branded manufacturer of sanitary napkins, and two of Hengan’s direct sanitary napkin competitors generated 


operating profit margins between ~8-11%. 





What is Hengan’s real sanitary napkin segment operating profit margin? How long has Hengan been reporting 


fabricated profits?  





We suspect that Hengan started fabricating its sanitary napkin segment profits in 2005, when, in the face of heavy 


competition, Hengan’s sanitary napkin segment profitability inexplicably spiked along with reported borrowings.  





In 2004 Hengan reported sanitary napkin operating profit margin of 23.9%.  While 23.9% operating profit margin is 


50% greater than what the competing CFO we spoke with suggested as today’s peak margin profile for a branded 


sanitary napkin manufacturer, we do believe that Hengan’s leading market share and size have afforded certain 


economies of scale.  We think applying a 50% margin benefit to Hengan for economies of scale is more than 


appropriate (if not generous) for a commoditized business such as sanitary napkins. 





If we apply Hengan’s 2004 sanitary napkin segment operating profit margin of 23.9% to years 2005 through 1H’18, 


we calculate that Hengan has fabricated RMB 9.4 billion of cumulative profits from its sanitary napkin segment 


since 2005.

We believe Hengan’s fabricated profits have manifested as fake cash on its balance sheet.

FABRICATED BANK BALANCES 





Investors should be suspicious of companies that purportedly generate significant net income and boast large bank 


balances yet continue to rely heavily on short-term borrowings.  As of June 30, 2018, Hengan’s reported working 


capital balance was RMB 7.6 billion, near historical highs.   








 
Source:  Hengan Annual Reports 2000 – 2017, Hengan 1H’18 Interim Report, Hengan China Bond Prospectus 





Yet despite Hengan’s reported working capital surplus, from August to December 2018 Hengan China issued six 


separate tranches of debt to investors raising a total of RMB 7.5 billion with the majority of proceeds earmarked for 


working capital!

If Hengan’s reported working capital surplus was at a peak level, why would Hengan need to raise any capital to 


support its working capital needs?  We believe the real reason Hengan recently increased its borrowings is because 


Hengan’s reported cash balance is fabricated.  





As of June 30, 2018, Hengan reported bank balances of RMB 19.8 billion, of which RMB 13.4 billion was in the form 


of short-term bank time deposits.

Hengan’s Deputy CFO disclosed on our call that half of Hengan’s current cash balance is offshore.   











Question: “I'm wondering because I see Hengan has much cash sitting on the bank. So, I'm 


wondering what's the percentage it will be offshore? Or what's the percentage onshore?” 





Hengan’s Deputy CFO Answer: “I think that roughly I can show you half by half. Roughly, half 


by half.” 


 
Source: Excerpt from Call with Hengan’s Deputy CFO 





To confirm Hengan’s Deputy CFO statement that half of Hengan’s current cash balance is offshore, we used a sum of 


the parts analysis using Hengan’s reported filings, Hengan China’s Bond Prospectuses, and credit reports for Hengan’s 


PRC subsidiaries.  





Specifically, we subtracted Hengan China (consolidated) and Hengan (company) from Hengan (consolidated), leaving 


us with “Plug” subsidiaries located both onshore (“Hengan PRC Plug entities”) and offshore (“Hengan Offshore Plug 


entities”).  Credit Reports disclose bank balances for the onshore PRC Plug entities. If we subtract PRC Plug entities, 


the remaining balance is what we would expect as bank balances at Hengan’s Offshore Plug entities.

Hengan’s Deputy CFO gave us three reasons why half of Hengan’s cash balance is offshore: 1) international raw 


material sales, 2) international raw material procurement, and 3) interest rate arbitrage scheme. 





Excerpt from Call With Hengan’s Deputy CFO 





Question: “Okay. So the reason the company has so much cash offshore is for-- what's the 


reason the company needs so much cash offshore?” 





Hengan’s Deputy CFO Answer: “Okay. I think that the reason I can show you. Offshore is our 


company that we purchase the raw materials. Because actually, as I mentioned earlier, one of our 


business called tissue, their raw materials are mainly coming from overseas. So offshore in Hong 


Kong and Macau is the arm for us to purchase the raw materials that is to settle the money in US 


dollars, something like that. So that's why we need some sort of cash in order for us to finance such 


offshore purchasing of our raw materials from overseas. And the amount is quite huge because our 


tissue business has grown a lot and very fast as well. So actually it's demanding a lot of the raw 


materials from overseas to support this operation. That is the first reason for that one. 





Secondly, as I mentioned earlier, you have, talking about, the comparatively low interest rate, 


borrowing interest rate, in Hong Kong, for borrowing the money from a financial institution. So this 


is why we do some sort of arbitrage in interest rate offshore to gain a quite a good, talking about, 


100 bps of spread from overseas. So that's why we have maintained this kind of borrowing and also 


the cash deposit to earn this interest income. So that's the second reason. 





The third reason is that we also need cash as well in Hong Kong and Macau, talking about overseas 


company as well, because one of our big business is to sell our raw paper. Raw paper is the third 


part that's produced after converting wood pulp to the paper. And we sell to some of it to 


international market players, some in Australia, some in Singapore, etc. So that's why we also need 


cash from overseas companies to our Hong Kong-- so that's why we also maintain this cash as well. 


So this is the major reason why we have this cash balance in Hong Kong.” 
 


Source: Excerpt from Call with Hengan’s Deputy CFO 





However, we question the credibility of these reasons given the significant increase in Hengan’s offshore cash balances 


in 2016 and 2017 as compared to Hengan’s offshore cash balances in 2014 and 2015.  Per our plug calculation, Hengan 


had less than 10% of its cash offshore in 2014 and 2015 as compared to 50% of its cash offshore in 2016 and 2017. 





In its annual reports, Hengan disclosed that international sales have accounted for less than 10% of Hengan’s reported 


revenue for each year since 2014, suggesting international sales growth is not the reason for the significant increased 


in Hengan’s offshore cash balance.

Hengan China’s 2018 Corporate Bond (1st Tranche) Prospectus dated July 20, 2018 disclosed that raw material 


procurement from 2015 to 2017 varied little year to year, suggesting that raw material procurement is not the reason 


for Hengan’s large increase in offshore cash and bank balances in 2016 and 2017.

Hengan’s Deputy CFO’s third reason why half of Hengan’s cash balance is offshore is because of a profitable currency 


risk-free interest rate arbitrage strategy.  In our call, Hengan’s Deputy CFO elaborated on the details and mechanics 


of Hengan’s currency-risk free interest rate arbitrage scheme:  





Excerpt from Call With Hengan’s Deputy CFO 





Question: “I want to talk a bit about your capital allocation. One thing that kind of confused 


me is you've got pretty large cash balances, but you also have large borrowing balances. So why is 


that the case?” 





Hengan’s Deputy CFO Answer: “We always do a lot of the interest rate arbitrage in our 


country, in our city, because I can share with you which is a very normal case in the last year. Last 


year, for example, in 2017, our average loan rate in Hong Kong, which is denominated in Hong 


Kong dollars and US dollars, it is only 1.4% per annum. 1.4% per annum. We borrow the money 


from Hong Kong. And then we have over the deposit from some banks which is safe banks and also 


held to maturities. That percent for the deposit which also I'm talking about 2.2 to 2.4 percent for 


deposit, the fixed interest rate. So the maturities have been matched from the borrowings and all the 


deposits but we earn roughly, sorry 100 basis points.  That's why in last year 2017 for example, we 


have, I think, talking about, roughly 100 million of net interest income derived from this kind of 


exercise. So that's the reason why we do this kind of borrowings but also a cash arbitrage. I can 


share with you--yeah. 





 For example, in Hong Kong our Hong Kong borrowings will be only denominated in Hong Kong 


and US dollars and our deposit will only be denominated in Hong Kong or US dollars, which are 


exactly the same. So we don't have any-- in theory, we don't have any exchange rate exposure. On 


the other hand, in China, mainland China, we borrow in RMB. And we use it for that purpose, to 


pay our RMB expenses, or we will place in RMB deposit. Yeah. Because I can share with you, that 


you can also check, for the exchange rate exposure we don't have any for financing activities. We 


don't have for financial activities.” 





Question: “If you are borrowing-- your onshore borrowing, is it at higher rates? I don't 


understand because your onshore borrowing is at like 4 or 5 or 6 percent or something? And it's 


short-term borrowing.” 





Hengan’s Deputy CFO Answer: “Yeah. But we also got deposit of 6% which is 100 basis points 


as well. So that is why it is actually the same margin. We borrow the money at a higher rate but we 


also got a high deposit rate. So that's why we do this kind of thing.

During Hengan’s 2Q’18 results earnings call on August 22, 2018, Hengan’s CEO discussed details about a currency 


risk-free interest rate arbitrage that Hengan was implementing to make a spread between the interest expense of its 


borrowings and the interest income earned on its bank deposits.   





Hengan CEO Excerpt from Hengan Earnings Conference Call 





 
Source: August 22, 2018 Earnings Conference Call 


https://xueqiu.com/8818149395/112582453 
 


We ask: how likely is it that Hengan’s exponential increase in offshore bank balances in 2016 is from the successful 


implementation of a currency risk-free interest arbitrage strategy?  Does this sound a little bit like the classic Bernie 


Madoff “Split Strike Forward Conversion” or “Time Slicing” excuses for how to generate riskless returns?6  





Firstly, in what world can you borrow from one bank at rates lower than what another bank pays in interest on deposits 


without bearing currency risk?  Secondly, if there really was an opportunity to make 100 basis points spread between 


bank borrowings and bank deposits risk-free, wouldn’t competition from sophisticated financial institutions that are 


already in the money arbitrage business and who are significantly greater capitalized erode Hengan’s margins from 


its currency-risk free interest rate arbitrage scheme margins quickly, if not overnight? 





We think the more credible explanation is that Hengan has fabricated its reported cash balance and its net interest 


income from its short-term time deposits.  





From 2002 to 2008, Hengan’s reported cash and cash equivalents were 100% of its reported cash balance.  In 2009, 


Hengan introduced a new line item called “bank deposits” which is recently referred to as “bank time deposits” in 


Hengan’s filings.  Hengan’s reported bank time deposits balance grew significantly, representing 77% of Hengan’s 


reported cash and bank balances as of June 30, 2018.

Are the company’s debt and cash in the same currency?  Is any part of the profit earned from exchange rate differences?  


Much of the company’s wood pulp is imported with USD, and the USD is appreciating.  Will the company’s profit level fluctuate under the 
influence of changing exchange rates? 


We have over RMB10b, but the deposits and borrowings are in the same currency, the bonds issued and deposits are also in the same currency.  
The debts are issued by entrusted banks and the deposits are also placed in the bank, and we earn the spread. 


We would not purchase USD just because we see the USD appreciating, and I don’t know whether the USD is appreciating or falling.  We do 
not profit from exchange rate spreads and we do not allow finance to conduct these maneuvers.  We are mostly conservative and stable. 


Net cash is the same as last year.  Last year there was over [RMB]10b in cash, over [RMB]15b in borrowings, but [RMB]1.6b of net cash has to be 
maintained.  Regarding interest spreads, there was [RMB]55m of interest income in the 1st half of this year.  Furthermore, we had completed the exact 


currency match between deposits and debts 2 years ago.  This is consistent across Hong Kong and the Mainland and there is no exchange rate risks. 


The only risk arises from the purchase of raw materials in USD, which may lead to small losses due to exchange rates.  We the management will 
also pay close attention to the trends in exchange rates, and do some stable, low risks, and lock-in preparations to reduce losses.

We suspect that nearly all of Hengan’s short-term bank time deposits are fabricated.  We calculate that since 2009, 


Hengan has fabricated an additional RMB 1.6 billion in interest income from fabricated short-term bank time 


deposits.7

THE PAYOFF 





In our experience, the intent of most fraudsters is to enable insiders to egregiously benefit from the scam, ultimately 


at the expense of unsuspecting investors.  In the case of Hengan, we highlight oversized dividends financed by 


borrowings from third parties and undisclosed related party transactions involved in the construction and operation of 


a Hengan-funded non-core property in Fujian, China.  





a) RMB 7.8 Billion in Dividends 
 


The scheme’s orchestrators have already been handsomely rewarded with significant cash dividends.  Since being 


public, Hengan’s founders, Hengan CEO Mr. Hui Lin Chit and Chairman Mr. Sze Man Bok, have each owned ~20% 


of Hengan’s shares, with other insiders owning another 3-9% of Hengan’s shares. 8  Since 2005, Hengan has paid out 


RMB 18.6 billion in total dividends, which means Hengan Insiders have pocketed ~RMB 7.8 billion in cash 


dividends so far. 





The scam is simple… report fabricated profits to investors and borrow funds from creditors that are paid out to insiders 


via share dividends that would otherwise be unaffordable to pay. 





We calculate that Hengan’s actual profitability does not cover the Company’s recent historical dividend payout ratio, 


suggesting the Company’s dividends were financed by borrowings from creditors and not from Hengan generated 


profits.  We calculate that the actual dividend payout has exceeded net income since 2014.

b)  Insiders Benefit from Hengan Investment in Fujian Property  
 


We believe that Hengan lied to investors about the purchaser of a Hengan China subsidiary being independent, and 


that Hengan failed to disclose that the private family business of Hengan’s CEO was involved in the design, 


construction and operation of a property in Fujian, China. Specifically, Hengan insiders used Hengan’s cash 


investments in Fujian Xiamen Hengan International Plaza (“Xiamen Hengan Plaza”) to benefit the private family 


business of Hengan’s CEO without disclosing the relationship to insiders.  Undisclosed benefits include cash from 


expenses and an illicit gain from the undisclosed related party purchase of a Hengan subsidiary receiving property 


management income for the bargain basement price of 0.7x 2016 net income. 





On September 9, 2012, Hengan announced its plans to convert a partially constructed training center into a hotel at 


Xiamen Hengan Plaza. Hengan had already spent HKD 220 million on the construction of the training center and was 


now going to spend an additional HKD 360 million into the hotel conversion project.

Hengan is not in the hotel management business or in the real estate speculation business, so why would Hengan 


decide to invest HKD 580 million in a non-core property?  Undisclosed to shareholders, evidence suggests that Hengan 


CEO Mr. Hui Lin Chit’s family business stood to benefit.  





A local online property directory disclosed 9  that Xiamen Hengan Property Co., Ltd. (“Xiamen Property”) was 


responsible for the property management of Xiamen Hengan Plaza.  Hengan China 2017 1st Tranche Super Short-


Term Commercial Paper Prospectus dated March 24, 2017 disclosed that Xiamen Property generated net income of 


RMB 1.3 million in the first nine months of 2016, an increase of 300% from its full year 2015 profits.

We think this evidence clearly indicates Hengan lied about its Xiamen Property disposal to an independent third party. 


In reality, Hengan disposed of Xiamen Property to an undisclosed related party of Hengan’s CEO at the bargain 


basement price of 0.7x 2016 net income, significantly less than what shareholders would have received in proceeds 


had Hengan sold the income stream to an independent third party at fair market value.  





We believe that such a deeply discounted sales price is a clear example of Hengan’s CEO siphoning assets from 


Hengan to undisclosed related parties at the expense of minority shareholders. Using employees or friends as nominee 


shareholders of private business to disguise de facto self-dealing is not uncommon in fraudulent companies.  However, 


it appears that the Xiamen Property disposal was not the only way Hengan’ CEO benefitted from Hengan’s investment 


into the Xiamen Hengan Plaza in Fujian.

A project promotion article released on a local online property directory12 in August 2013 disclosed that Xiamen 


Hengan Plaza was developed by Lianjie Property Group.   








 
Source: http://m.xmhouse.com/news/news_pdetailv2.aspx?id=486222  











To us, evidence suggests that Hengan CEO’s private business was involved in the design and construction of Xiamen 


Hengan Plaza.  Hengan announced its expected investment of HKD 580 million through 2014 with no further details 


given to investors about its progress. We sent investigators to Fujian who confirmed that construction was completed, 


and that the property is operational.

Hengan fails to disclose that there exists a transactional relationship with Hengan CEO’s private family business, nor 


does Hengan disclose how much construction costs were ultimately used to build Xiamen Hengan Plaza.  Although 


we tried, we were unable to obtain any historical property record information for Xiamen Hengan Plaza.  We 


encourage regulators to review the Xiamen Hengan Plaza’s past ownership information and tax records, specifically 


for a breakdown between land and improvement values to understand the full extent of Hengan insider self-dealing in 


and around the construction of Xiamen Hengan Plaza.
