Executive Summary

Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40%-60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


After conducting in-depth channel checks and a rigorous forensic review, Spruce Point has significant concerns about Prestige 
Consumer Healthcare (NYSE: PBH, “Prestige Brands”, or “the Company”), a roll-up of orphaned brand named, over-the-counter 
(OTC) healthcare products. Our research shows Prestige to be a challenged and overleveraged consumer healthcare business 
perceived to have steady growth and the ability to generate free cash flow to reduce debt. We believe Prestige will struggle to 


reduce its current level of debt as the business experiences further competitive pressures, and working capital and free cash flow 
strains intensify. As the shift to online purchases grow in the post-COVID-19 world, Prestige appears ill-positioned, and has 


significant exposure to traditional brick and mortar retailers. As the Company’s prior path to achieve growth through debt fueled 
acquisitions is no longer possible, Prestige’s organic growth has slowed, and financial strains have intensified. Management’s 


recent comments to focus on reducing debt may be a signal of cash flow drying up. Prestige continues to miss its organic growth 
targets and misallocates capital while receiving handsome compensation along the way. Prestige’s low-quality management team 


has consistently underdelivered on its promises, and it is time for the CEO and CFO to resign. We have serious concerns regarding 
current CFO and Chief Accounting Officer Christine Sacco and her team given their abysmal history at Boulder Brands, another 


consumer brands roll-up which collapsed 50% after our successful warning about accounting and financial strains. As a result of 
our investigation, we are calling on PBH’s audit committee to conduct a full investigation into its financial reporting and accounting 
practices. Prestige’s disclosures are worsening and its corporate governance lags peers. With consumption growth of 2%, lack of 


pricing power and increased competition, we view the Company’s 2-3% organic revenue growth guidance as unattainable. 
Combined with a rising cost structure, we believe PBH’s organic earnings will experience an unpreventable terminal decline.


Long-Term Secular Challenges And Competition From Private Label Brands, With Significant Brick And Mortar Retail Exposure
 We believe PBH’s orphaned brand-named products face significant competition in both price and product placement compared to store brands


• PBH brands appear to be struggling online due to lower product placement on retailers’ websites and inferior prices
 Nielsen data shows PBH’s price and volume sales are declining while private label brands are experiencing price and volume growth
 The 4 P’s of marketing suggest that PBH is at a clear disadvantage:


• Product: OTC consumer healthcare products with expired patents and high competition from comparable store brands
• Price: Not price competitive; store brands are priced at a significant discount. PBH brand are typically ~30-100% more expensive


• Despite evidence of increasing promotional provisioning, margin pressure and our conversations with former employees and industry 
experts, management continues to downplay any sort of pricing pressure


• Historically higher margins at smaller retailers have made up for pricing pressures from larger retailers.  However, as larger retailers 
continue to grow their share of sales, PBH may face increasingly more difficulty in maintaining current margins


• Place: Brands are intermingled with store brands or often found on lower shelves, while competitor products are found on premium, eye
level shelves. Heavy brick and mortar retail focus with 20%+ of sales from Walmart and at a clear disadvantage in online channels


• Promotion: Increased promotional spending as competition continues to intensify. Despite this push, organic growth continues to struggle
 Amazon’s move into pharmacy with its “Basic Care” branded products and acquisition of Pill Pack presents further challenges for PBH as 


traditional traffic shifts away from pharmacies and supermarkets to e-commerce channels

Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


Multiple Signs Of Financial Strain As Organic Revenue Is Flat, EBITDA Declines And Cash Flow Dynamics Worsen
 Organic revenue growth has compounded at 1% over the past 6 years and has continued to miss targets
 Red Flag: Under Sacco's leadership, PBH has made three unusual and stealth changes to the discussion of revenue from major brands: "net 


revenue", "revenue", "total revenue". We observe a similar stealth change in revenue disclosure made at Boulder Brands ahead of its stock 
collapsing


 We estimate organic EBITDA has declined each of the past 6 years
• Reported EBITDA only declined in the past 2 years due to the absence of an acquisition 


 Substantial delta between GAAP and non-GAAP financials from aggressive adjustments; non-GAAP EBITDA ignores the costs associated with 
acquisitions and divestitures even thought they are core to the Company’s strategy
• Company reports an aggressive “non-GAAP adjusted free cash flow” removing the impact of transaction and discretionary financing costs. 


Management wants every benefit of its actions, but none of the “cash” costs associated with its decisions
 Working capital under pressure as cash conversion cycle has exploded from 67 to 110 days since 2015


• Since 2018, DSOs are up from 48 to 57 days and DIOs are up from 94 to 109 days, while DPOs have only increased from 52 to 55
 PBH’s poor working capital management is a clear outlier compared with its peers


• DSO has grown significantly faster than peers; PBH is 1 of 2 companies with 4 consecutive years of DSOs increasing
• DIO and cash conversion cycle have increased faster than peers; PBH is the only company with multiple years of double-digit increases


 Receivables growth has significantly outpaced revenue growth on both an absolute and organic basis with the divergence accelerating since 
Christine Sacco became CFO


 Multiple signs of ballooning inventory levels as products are not selling-though to customers as obsolete inventory grows and inventory 
purchase obligations as a percentage of sales rises
• While management attributes this trend to customer destocking, there is evidence that this trend has slowed in calendar year 2019 as PBH’s 


main customers experience a minimal change in days inventory over the past year relative to declines in prior years
 Increases in promotional provisioning and consistent rise in advertising & promotional spend of its top brands shows efforts to fend off 


increasing competitive pressure
• Despite the rise in promotional spend, PBH struggles to achieve meaningful organic revenue growth


 Signs of declining efficiency as revenue and EBITDA per full-time-employee have declined over the past two years
 Red Flag: Potentially aggressive changes to depreciation assumptions have benefited earnings over the past 3 years


Continuously Misses Organic Growth Targets; We Believe The CEO & CFO Should Resign
 Since CEO Lombardi (June 2015) and CFO Sacco (September 2016) were appointed, PBH missed its organic revenue growth targets for 4 out 


of 5 years between 2015 – 2019, and was on pace to fall short in 2020 before the Q4 benefit due to the COVID-19 pandemic 
 Given management’s inability to achieve its #1 most important goal, organic growth, we believe it is appropriate for the CEO & CFO to resign
8


Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


Poor History Of M&A And Capital Allocation Has Resulted In A Weak Balance Sheet And The Need To Delever
 Debt fueled acquisitions has resulted in Net Debt/EBITDA of 4.7x and 87% of its balance sheet goodwill and intangibles; limited ability for more 


M&A and increasing focus on paying down debt before cash flow challenges intensify
 Transaction multiples have increased from ~7x EBTIDA to 10-12x over the past few deals; we believe recent multiples are understated due to 


the reported “synergy adjusted multiples” which are lower than the comparable multiples
 Recent deals have not benefited organic growth; management stated high single-digit growth for Fleet and DenTek at the time of the deals


• Evidence Fleet’s revenue growth declined after the deal; Y-o-Y change in revenue of 7.2%, 1.5%, (4.0%) for the first 3 quarters of 2018
• Management received a special "integration" bonus for the Fleet deal, and heavily promoted it with assurances of its success. Yet, PBH 


ended up taking an intangible impairment charge 
 FCF conversion is misleading for a roll-up given allocation of capital away from capital expenditures towards acquisitions


• Management touts its “best-in-class” FCF conversion but does not mention its “worst-in-class” organic growth as a result of underinvesting 
in the business; capex and R&D as a percentage of sales is among the lowest compared to its peers


 Recent change in capital allocation plan: PBH has shifted its focus from reducing debt and M&A to repurchasing its own shares
• Share repurchases at ~10-11x EBITDA, a 1-2x premium compared to the ~9x level it paid for the underlying business which is experiencing 


near zero organic growth and over levered


International Business Strains Mirror The U.S. While Management Overhypes International Growth Opportunities
 Management promotes international growth opportunities with a long-term growth target of 5%+


• International business represents ~10% of revenue; Australia accounts for >50% of international business
 In Australia, PBH’s largest international market, the Company is showing signs of strain as revenue growth is slowing and potentially being 


achieved by loosening customer terms, shown by ballooning accounts receivable growth
 Singapore and UK entities are showing similar signs of increased working capital needs and growing receivables


CFO Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands, Another Consumer Product Focused Roll-Up Touting Growth That Ultimately 
Collapsed, Draws Many Parallels To PBH
 In February 2013, Prescience Point Research Group, Co-Founded by Spruce Point’s Founder and Chief Investment Officer Ben Axler, 


published a “Strong Sell” recommendation on Boulder Brands. Over the next 2 years shares fell over 50% before being acquired at a discount 
to the share price before the report
• PBH changed revenue disclosure for its major brands from “net” to “total” revenues, an identical change Boulder made in 2014 right before 


its shares collapsed. By making this change, we believe the Company is masking revenue loss
• Sacco received an SEC Comment Letter in 2015; we find many similarities between Boulder’s poor disclosure practices and PBH’s today


 After joining PBH, Sacco brought over three senior members of her team from Boulder and hired a new Director of IR with ties to Boulder
 Sacco previously worked in multiple positions at Alpharma (ALO), another Company with several accounting related problems
 We have concerns of PBH’s audit partner at PwC, due to her lack of experience auditing large public, consumer product companies
 Sacco overstates biography by representing herself as a CPA despite it being inactive
9


Spruce Point Is Short Prestige Brands And Estimates 
40% - 60% Downside ($14.80 - $22.50/sh)


We See A Terrible Risk / Reward Opportunity And Significant Downside To Current Share Price
 Spruce Point has a history of successfully exposing poorly positioned consumer focused companies before the market realizes fundamentals 


have changed, and the share price collapses (e.g. Boulder Brands (BDBD), Church & Dwight (CHD), WD-40 Company (WDFC), Weis Markets 
(WMK), iRobot Corp (IRBT)). We expect Prestige Brands to follow a similar course 


 Poor organic growth, lack of competitive advantage and eroding market share deserves a valuation multiple at a significant discount to peers
 Trades at a premium to the sum of its acquisitions (average deal multiple ~9x EBITDA), yet none of the brands have driven any top line growth
 PBH currently trades 24% below sell-side brokers’ consensus price target of $46 per share


• We believe it is overly optimistic to view PBH’s brands as market leaders which will be able to maintain share amid increasing competition 
from store brands, and as sales move towards online channels


• Management’s 2-3% long-run revenue growth target appears unattainable due to lack of pricing power and increased competition; combined 
with rising costs, PBH’s organic earnings may face an unpreventable terminal decline


• It is time for management to reset expectations lower and take additional asset impairments. PBH is likely using unrealistic 
expectations in valuing its goodwill and intangibles. Its auditor recently cited as a “Critical Audit Matter” - Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived 
Intangible Asset Impairment Assessments for Reporting Units and Brands of Certain Product Groups


 Spruce Point arrives at our price target by applying a multiple consistent with the reality that PBH is worth a discount to the sum of the multiples 
paid for its assets, which have demonstrated effectively zero growth, and are now under increased pressures. We project revenue to decline and 
margins to erode


Poor Corporate Governance And Weakening Financial Disclosure Practices Raise Several Red Flags
 Insiders own a measly 1.2% and have little at risk for leveraging PBH's balance sheet and saddling it with poor acquisitions
 Poor revenue disclosure: Does not break out the effect of change in prices and volumes, revenue by product (“Big 5” brands account for 50% of 


revenue) and impact of new product development
• Lack of new product disclosure despite management touting potential for new product development during the acquisition of Fleet
• SEC’s Comment Letter to B&G Foods sets precedent for Company’s to increase the level of revenue disclosure to include information 


material to investors
• Red Flag: Removal of principal customers and market share disclosure raises concerns as the Company is facing increased competition 


 We believe executive compensation is not tied to the Company’s key objectives; compensation is tied to sales and EBITDA. It should be 
compensated on organic sales growth and cash flow available to pay down debt
• Management has been paid handsomely with base salary increases and large bonuses despite missing organic growth targets in 4 out of the 


past 6 years and free cash flow guidance in 3 out of the past 6 years

PBH’s Recent History


Since the most recent acquisition of Fleet closed in 2017 PBH’s share price has underperformed. We believe PBH will 
continue to underperform as headwinds result in negative organic growth and declining margins.

Prestige Brands Is Not Recession Resistant

Linda Bolton Weiser
DA Davidson


November 2, 2017


“So if we were to fall into a recession, even though you’re kind of recession resistant, would that affect 
the lenders would think about lending to you?”


Spruce Point believes that even after arguably the worst of COVID-19 is behind us, management still has no visibility. 
Analysts baking in resiliency to PBH’s model fail to see the structural changes happening that, we believe, will prevent 


a recovery. We believe management’s inability to set long-term goals, regardless of the current economic 
environment, shows a complete lack of faith in the sustainability of their own business.


Based on a new addition to PBH’s 2020 Proxy Statement, we believe PBH is warning investors that the business is not recession
proof and is expecting to face challenges as a result of the macroeconomic environment


Analysts believe PBH is recession resistant. DA Davidson, with the highest price target on the street, stated so on an earnings call

“Sinking Ship”


Prestige Brands is described as a graveyard for dying brands on an employee review website. We believe this is an 
accurate depiction, and that management is taking aggressive actions to make it appear as if there is still life left in the 


portfolio.


Source: Glassdoor.com


“Prestige is not what you think of a pharma company. The 
company does not actually create and research new products -
it is a buyout firm that buys drug brands that are already past 
patent life and are competing with generics. The best hope is 
that customers are ignorant and continue paying premiums. 
Each of the company's products will eventually reach end of 
life. There is no growth beyond short term marketing gimmicks. 
Products and brands get bought to come here to die.”

Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands


Prestige Brand’s current CFO was the former CFO of Boulder Brands, another consumer product focused roll-up 
touting growth, but ultimately collapsed upon disappointment and an unexpected impairment. Since becoming CFO, 


Christine Sacco has recruited multiple members of her Boulder team to Prestige. In our opinion, Prestige shares many 
of the same accounting and financial strains that foreshadowed Boulder's collapse.

Product Prices Are Not Competitive


Based on our research, PBH’s products are at a competitive disadvantage to store brands (e.g. CVS, Walgreens, 
Walmart’s Equate) based on pricing and product placement. Analyzing prices across many of the Company’s largest 
distribution channels, we believe the level of competition results in no pricing power for PBH. We found prices differ 
across retailers, with Walmart having the lowest prices across the board. Given Walmart is PBH’s largest customer 


and the choice for the most cost-conscious customer, we believe there is significant pressure on PBH’s prices. 
Historically, PBH would balance price pressure from big box customers by passing it onto smaller customers. As 


larger customers account for a greater percentage of PBH’s sales, this practice may no longer be able to offset the 
pressure and margins will decline.


“As far as the big box stores, the pricing for the past 10 years has been very flat. There has been some growth in certain 
segments, such as C stores where they have seen some growth on the pricing side. But for the big box stores, the price 
changes were very flat because of reason like allowances, they would give a lot of concessions.”


Former PBH
Employee


“I am worried about the supply chain disruption because sometimes they can absorb the price increase from the 
suppliers. but sometimes retailers cannot pass on the consumer. I would think that for the big box retailers, they’ll have a 
lot of price pressure. They will have to come up with some creative strategy to pass it on to other channel that are not as 
price elastic.”


“I don’t think they will have a lot of price increase they can pass on to the big box retailers because they will come up 
with private brands. They will grow and put intense pressure. The only way is to go after the smaller players.”


“The biggest risk is pricing pressure. I would say big pricing pressure from the retailers. Also, supply chain distribution is 
another risk. I would say price pressure will eat up their margin because they are over exposed to big box retailers.”

Stretched Accounts Receivable


We observe a significant discrepancy between PBH’s reported net revenue and accounts receivable growth. A 
meaningful divergence has occurred since Christine Sacco assumed the role of CFO, as receivables growth has 


accelerated while revenue growth slows. When revenue declined in 2014, receivables shrunk; however when revenue 
declined in 2019 and 2020, receivables continued to rise. This raises concerns as accounts receivable growth 


outpacing revenue growth is a classic sign of potential accounting shenanigans and is often cited as a top red flag to 
predict accounting scandals.(1,2)

Promotional Provisioning Rising


PBH’s financial disclosures show an increase in promotional provisioning (brand marketing, planograms, GPO fees, 
customer coupons) driven by growth in trade promotions. Additionally, there has been a consistent rise in the spend 
as a percentage of revenue for its top brands. Based on our conversion with a former PBH employee, the rise in the 


respective account balances may be indicative of the Company’s reaction to pricing pressure.

Acquisition Multiples Increasing


Dental 
Concepts


According to the Company’s disclosures, transaction multiples have increased from ~7x EBITDA to 10-12x over the 
past few deals. However, we believe recent multiples are understated due to the reported “synergy adjusted multiples” 


which are lower than the comparable multiple. PBH’s most recent acquisition of Fleet, while reported at 11.8x post-
synergy EBITDA, valued the business at 16.2x its pre-synergy amount. When the Fleet and DenTek deals were 


announced, management discussed high single-digit revenue growth, yet these acquisitions have resulted in limited 
organic growth for PBH. As organic growth has disappeared, PBH looks to have become reliant on generating growth 


through acquisitions, whatever the cost.

Christine Sacco’s History At Boulder Brands


Prestige Brand’s current CFO was the former CFO of Boulder Brands, another consumer product focused roll-up 
touting growth, but ultimately collapsed upon disappointment and an unexpected impairment. Since becoming CFO, 


Christine Sacco has recruited multiple members of her Boulder team to Prestige. In our opinion, Prestige shares many 
of the same accounting and financial strains that foreshadowed Boulder's collapse.

Boulder Brands’ Historical Financial Strain


Boulder Brands, under Sacco’s financial and accounting leadership, experienced similar financial strain leading up to 
its collapse as PBH faces today. Prior to its eventual acquisition, Boulder’s revenue and EBITDA were declining. 


Boulder’s working capital metrics deteriorated as DSOs, DIOs and cash conversion exploded, and inventory built up 
on the Company’s balance sheet. We believe PBH will likely suffer a similar fate.

A Sacco Staple Disclosure Change


After Sacco joined PBH, the Company changed its revenue disclosure of its major brands from “net revenues” to 
“total revenues” (gross revenues). In 2014, under Sacco’s leadership, Boulder Brands made a similar change to its 


description of revenue by large customers, switching from “net” sales to “gross” sales. Shortly thereafter, 
Boulder’s CEO resigned. We believe this is a major red flag for PBH and Sacco.

Sacco’s SEC Comment Letter


In July 2015, Christine Sacco received a Comment Letter from the SEC in reference to Boulder Brands’ disclosure 
practices. We believe there are similarities between the SEC’s comments to Boulder and current 


weak disclosure practices by PBH. We believe the SEC should investigate Prestige Brands’ disclosure practices.

relationships with multiple members of her team, who were all connected with Boulder Brands raises concerns.

Date Event Timeline
Nov 2002 Sacco appointed Senior Manager, Financial Reporting at Alpharma Inc. after Matt Farrell was appointed CFO in April 2002


Feb 2004
Subsequent to the date of this report, as part of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's auditors communicated to the 
Company's management and Audit Committee two reportable conditions in the internal controls of the USHP division that, when viewed collectively, constitute a 
material weakness in the Company's internal controls. 


March 2004
The Company is presently being sued by the State of Massachusetts alleging fraud in connection with these state Medicaid programs and has been notified by several 
additional states that it is the subject of investigations related to the same subject matter.


May 2004
Alpharma amends SEC filings. Financial statements for 2003 are being restated to adjust inventory costs related to a vendor contract that was subject to an amendment 
and letter of intent in January 2003 ("2003 amendment"). The 2003 amendment included a provision that permitted the vendor, under certain circumstances, to 
retroactively invoice the company for inventory purchases since January 2003 at a higher price


Feb 2005
On February 16, 2005, Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") was notified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Company's independent registered public accounting 
firm, that PwC would decline to stand for re-election as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm at the Company's upcoming 2005 Annual Meeting 
of Stockholders


April 2005


In connection with its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, the Registrant identified the following internal 
control deficiencies:  Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy or the review and monitoring of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts 
affecting a number of accounts in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business, including revenues, accounts receivables and accrued expenses, were not maintained at 
December 31, 2004. Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax account balances, including the determination of deferred income tax assets 
and liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, were not maintained. In connection with the Registrant's disclosure in the Prior 8-K that it did not have 
effective controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 


April 2005 


The Company has determined that it was not in compliance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 with certain debt covenants related to its 8 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011(the 
"Senior Notes") relating to the timely payments of liquidated damages due to its Senior Note holders and timely filing of certain certificates required in the covenants to 
the Senior Notes at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  As a result of these defaults, on April 28, 2005, the Company's management concluded that the previously issued 
financial statements for 2003 and 2004 should no longer be relied upon.  As a result of the defaults described above, the Company's has concluded that an additional 
material weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2004. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure the 
appropriate review and monitoring of its compliance with certain of its debt covenants at December 31, 2004.


Aug 2006 Matt Farrell resigns as CFO


Dec 2006

disclose any allegations underlying this request. The Company intends to cooperate with the Department


Jan 2008 Sacco, now a Vice President and Treasurer, left Alpharma for Smart Balance, Inc. (later known as Boulder Brands)

DOJ Settlement: The settlement resolves allegations that, between January 1, 2000 and December 29, 2008, Alpharma paid health care providers to induce them to 
promote or prescribe Kadian and made misrepresentations about the safety and efficacy of the drug, which is used to treat chronic moderate to severe pain.


Prior to Boulder, Sacco held multiple finance positions of increasing responsibility at Alpharma (NYSE: ALO) under 
then CFO Matt Farrell. While we acknowledge that some of ALO’s issue may have pre-dated her arrival, there is 


evidence the business got progressively worse under her tenure, culminating in a “non-reliance” on Alpharma’s 
financial statements, multiple restatements, material weaknesses, a DOJ Federal investigate and a covenant breach.

CFO’s Apparent Lack Of Attention To Detail


We question Christine Sacco’s attention to detail and oversight of Prestige Brand’s financial statements and controls. 
PBH lists Ms. Sacco as a CPA despite her license being “inactive.” This inconsistency looks to show a lack of 


attention to detail by PBH and its CFO.

Who Is Auditing Sacco And PBH?


We have concerns regarding PBH’s current Engagement Partner at PwC, Terri-Ann Dautzenberg. Terri became PBH’s 
audit partner in 2018, the first full fiscal year after Sacco became CFO. Based on her other listed current and prior 


clients, MPM Holdings/Momentive and Eagle Bulk Shipping, her expertise is closer aligned with industrial/chemical 
businesses and not PBH’s industry of consumer products/healthcare. Eagle Bulk is a penny stock that has gone 


through a bankruptcy and allegations of sanctions violations under Dautzenberg’s watch. MPM Holdings was majority 
owned by private equity investors. We question her experience auditing large public, consumer products companies 


and believe a new audit partner should be assigned to PBH.

Concerns Of International Auditors


We have concerns with PBH’s auditors in the United Kingdom (UK). PBH uses 2 different audit firms, neither the same 
as its U.S. auditor PwC who audits its Australian entity. Seymour Taylor began auditing Prestige Brands (UK) Limited 


after Ernst & Young resigned in 2012. In Spruce Point's experience, the same global audit firm is generally used to 
audit all international subsidiaries. In this case, it is unusual to see that PwC England and Singapore did not audit 


PBH's entities.

Prior to the Q4 benefit of COVID-19, as of Q3 2020, PBH was on pace to achieve flat organic growth for FY 2020. Over 


the past 4 years, PBH has not achieved its current 2-3% growth target. Years of poor organic growth have been 
overshowed by debt fueled acquisitions, which stalled in 2019.

Organic EBITDA Growth Declining


Since the $750 million acquisition of Insight Pharma in September 2014, we estimate organic EBITDA has been 
declining. Acquisitions may have been used to obscure declining profitability over this time period. Our analysis 


shows that organic EBITDA growth has declined for the past 6 years, however the company reported EBITDA growth 
experienced declines in only 2019 and 2020, ironically the two years without the impact of an acquisition.

Non-GAAP Adjustments Driven By 
Acquisition Related Costs


Over time, there has been a substantial delta between GAAP and non-GAAP net income and EPS. We believe it is not 
appropriate to ignore acquisition related costs while PBH was building its business. Now as the Company is 


disposing assets, management wants investors to again ignore these costs.
