Report Released by asensio.com on AOB’s
Potential Undisclosed Related Party


Posted on August 5, 2009 by Asensio.com


A report released today by asensio.com on American Oriental


Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE: AOB) shows that based on Chinese


government filings, AOB may have made material omissions and


misrepresentations in U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission


(SEC) filings concerning two real estate transactions, totaling $104.9


million.


Based on discrepancies between AOB’s SEC filings and Chinese


filings, it appears that AOB may have completed the two


transactions with an undisclosed related party.


Filings with the China State Administration for Industry and


Commerce and the Hong Kong Companies Registry show a


relationship between AOB’s chairman and CEO, Tony Liu, and the


private Chinese company that reportedly sold real estate to AOB for


approximately $105 million. The Chinese filings are attached to the


report with translations.


It does not appear that AOB took standard steps for related-party


transactions to ensure that there were no irregularities in the $105


million expenditure. AOB’s auditors, independent directors and


legal counsel were contacted, but have not provided any comment


or explanation for the information contained in the asensio.com


report.

Undisclosed Related Party Documented in Public Government


Filings.”
