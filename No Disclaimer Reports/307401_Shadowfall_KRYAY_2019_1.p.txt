KERRY GROUP: THE HUNGER GAMES 
Kerry Group Plc (“Kerry”) is a UK and Irish listed company, capitalised €18.4bn. Kerry is a global provider 
of foods ingredients for the food, beverage and pharmaceutical industries. It has principally grown through 
a series of acquisitions. The group also produces and distributes branded consumer foods and private label 
foods in Ireland and the UK.  


Kerry reported revenue of €6.6bn and net income of €596m in 2018.

The market seems to perceive Kerry as an innovative ingredients and flavourings business, driven by 
acquisitions, synergy gains, restructurings and underlying economic growth. Kerry’s share price is close to 
all-time highs, as it commands a valuation of 18.8x EV/EBITDA.  


Over the decade past, Kerry certainly has been acquisitive, spending a cumulative €3.0bn on acquisitions 
since 2009 or 75% of its Free Cash Flow (FCF) generated during the same period. All paid for in cash. 
However, when we examine some of these acquisitions, we find a portrait of either loss making or generally 
low margin businesses, that in our view, stretch credulity as to how they collectively might assist Kerry in 
more than doubling its net income during the decade past. As such we have reason to question whether 
Kerry’s profitability may be inflated?

FOCUS ON ACQUISITIONS: WHAT IS KERRY BUYING? 


LOW MARGIN TO LOSS MAKING ACQUISITIONS? 


For an acquisitive business such as Kerry, we find that there is relatively limited disclosure regarding the 
financial metrics of the acquired businesses. When on occasion data is provided, it suggests that Kerry is 
buying relatively low margin businesses. According to this data provided by Kerry, the PAT margins of the 
businesses it acquired in the following years, collectively were:  


2011: 1.0% 


2015: 5.8% 


2017: 4.3% 


2018: 4.9% 


These PAT margins are around half of that which is achieved by Kerry at a group level.  


For such an acquisitive business it is unclear to us how Kerry consistently achieves margin progression when 
the businesses it acquires are apparently half as profitable as the existing group.  


2019 ACQUISITIONS: ONE EX-GROWTH, ANOTHER AN EYE-WATERING VALUATION? 


In December 2018, Kerry announced the acquisitions of Ariake USA and Southeastern Mills (SEM), for a 
combined consideration of €325m (completing Q1 2019). We calculate that Kerry paid c. 13.6x EBIT for 
Ariake USA and c. 24.7x EBIT for SEM. However:  


1. From Ariake Japan’s filings, it appears that in Q4 2018, Ariake USA had gone ex-growth and 
that Ariake USA’s operating margin may have fallen by 890bps to 19.2% from the year prior.  


2. Our view is that SEM is a fairly unspectacular seasonings and coatings business, with c. €78m in 
revenue. We believe that 24.7x EBIT is an eye-watering valuation to pay for such a business.    


2018 ACQUISITIONS: €202M PAID FOR BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN ZERO PROFITS AND ZERO 
NET TANGIBLE ASSETS? 


In October 2018, Kerry announced its acquisitions of Fleischmann’s Vinegar Company, Inc. (FVC) and 
AATCO Food Industries (AATCO), for a combined consideration of €365m. 


In total, Kerry spent €502m on acquisitions in 2018, entirely satisfied in cash with a €3.6m deferred payment.  


FVC has now had three owners since 2015. We calculate that Kerry paid 13.5x EBITDA for FVC, when 
its previous owner, Green Plains, two years prior paid a sub 10x EBITDA multiple.  


Excluding FVC, Kerry made 9 other acquisitions in 2018. We calculate that: 


1. Kerry paid €202.3m for these 9 businesses; 
2. Between them they would have reported combined losses of €4.7m; 
3. FVC contributed net tangible assets of €53.7m, suggesting that the 9 other businesses had net 


tangible assets of €0.3m between them.  


It appears to us that Kerry paid €202.3m for a group of businesses which combined had less than 
ZERO profits (estimated losses of €4.7m) and just €0.3m of net tangible assets between them.

2015 ACQUISITIONS: €216M PAID FOR BUSINESSES WITH LESS THAN ZERO PROFITS? 


In October 2015, Kerry announced its acquisitions of Red Arrow Products (Red Arrow), Island Oasis, and 
Biothera Inc.’s Wellmune® (Wellmune®).1 The total consideration for the three businesses was reported 
as US$735m (c. €677m). Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune® were reported to have annualised 
revenues of US$301m (c. €249m) and EBITDA of US$59m (c. €49m) in 2014.  


Excluding Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune®’s, Kerry purchased 7 other businesses in 2015. We 
calculate these other 7 businesses combined: 


1. Were bought for €216.3m; 
2. Would be expected to contribute c. €126.4m in full year revenue; 
3. Would have been loss making by c. €13.1m in 2015.  


2011 ACQUISITIONS: €386M PAID FOR BUSINESSES WITH ALMOST ZERO PROFITS? 


In 2011, Kerry made 14 acquisitions at a cost of €386m (€362m in cash). At the point of purchase, we 
calculate that these businesses were achieving combined profit after tax of what we view as a relatively 
paltry €2.7m on €261.5m in revenue.  


As an example of Kerry’s possible poor choice of acquisitions, we would highlight SuCrest GmbH. Kerry 
acquired the German based sweet ingredients and flavours business, SuCrest GmbH, in 2011 for €53.6m. 
Within five years of acquisition, SuCrest’s revenue and profitability had almost halved.   


LIMITED REVENUE GROWTH EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS? 


On a constant currency basis, we calculate that net acquired revenues have contributed 82% to Kerry’s 
top line growth since 2010. Since we find that these acquisitions have typically achieved PAT margins 
which are around half that achieved by Kerry, we believe this makes Kerry’s margin progression all the more 
puzzling.  


Kerry’s acquisitive appetite for revenue appears to us to be so voracious, that in 2011 we calculate it paid 
€140m for c. €17m of acquired revenue; i.e. an 8.2x revenue multiple.  


KERRY COMPARED TO PEERS 
Kerry list several peers, we view Givaudan, IFF, Glanbia and Symrise as the principal peers, although out 
of these, Kerry appears to resemble Glanbia the most. Givaudan, IFF and Symrise report EBITDA margins 
of over 19%, by contrast, Kerry and Glanbia’s EBITDA margins are 14.3% and 13.7% respectively.  


THE MARGIN MYTH 


The market may be under the impression that Kerry’s lower EBITDA margins relative to its more profitable 
peers is driven by Kerry spending more on R&D as compared to those peers. However, this does not appear 
to be the case. We calculate that Kerry’s R&D as a percentage of its sales was 4.2% in 2018. This is less 
than half that of Givaudan at 8.6%, whilst also lower than IFF at 7.8% and Symrise at 6.4%. Even in 
absolute terms of euros spent, Kerry’s R&D expenditure does not appear extraordinary. In the competitive 
markets of flavourings and ingredients, such relatively low R&D investment does raise the question how 
Kerry hopes to compete in developing flavourings and ingredients?

RESTRUCTURING COSTS – SIGNS OF LIMITED BANG FOR BUCK 


Kerry has incurred a total of €556m in restructuring charges since 2009. This compares to Givaudan, 
IFF, Glanbia and Symrise which have spent €294m, €291m, €79m and €59m respectively over the same 
period. In terms of improving EBITDA margin, we calculate that Kerry’s incremental margin increase since 
2009 has resulted in €847m in cumulative EBITDA gains, i.e. if €556m of restructuring costs has led to 
efficiencies and improved margins, then the apparent gain is €847m, or an incremental return of 1.52x of 
restructuring costs.  


Kerry’s 1.52x return compares relatively poorly to the returns of Givaudan (3.38x), IFF (1.80x) and Symrise 
(8.26x) on incremental EBITDA gains from each of their respective restructuring costs. In our view, it raises 
the question as to how effective Kerry’s restructuring has been, especially when considering that Kerry’s 
restructuring expenditure has been significantly greater than its peers.  


CASH TAX – PEERS SEEM TO PAY IN CASH WHAT THEY REPORT 


When it comes to tax, Kerry appears to be an outlier against its peers in regard to how much tax it pays in 
cash compared to how much tax it reports on its P&L. Since 2013, Kerry has paid on average 52% of its 
P&L tax in cash, this compares to Givaudan (98%), Glanbia (82%), Symrise (108%) and IFF (78%).  


DISPOSALS WHICH APPEAR TO CONTRADICT THE PURCHASER'S FILINGS 


Kerry reports it received €115.7m in cash disposal proceeds in 2015. From our review of local filings of the 
disposed companies we find discrepancies between these filings and the figures which Kerry reports.  


Our interpretation is that if the local filings are an accurate reflection of events, then it would lead us to 
conclude that Kerry’s 2015 and 2016 financial statements contain inaccuracies, or vice-versa. Further, in the 
light of the fact that Ms. Marguerite Larkin (Kerry’s current CFO) signed off on Kerry’s 2015 financial 
statements, when she was Kerry’s auditor, does not in our view inspire great confidence in her recent 
appointment as Kerry’s CFO (see corporate governance section).  


Kerry reports a €115.7m disposal related cash receipt in 2015, whereas local filings make c. €110.8m 
of this tricky to reconcile.  


KERRY’S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
We have some concern regarding Kerry’s corporate governance. Since 2015, almost half of Kerry’s fifteen-
member Board (at that time) have retired, including its CEO and Chairman. In terms of the key replacement 
positions of CEO and Chairman, Kerry appointed a new CEO who had joined the Group through its 
graduate programme in 1996 and a Chairman who has been with the Group since 2012, formerly Chairing 
its Audit Committee.  


The appointment that raises the proverbial eyebrow is that of Kerry’s CFO, Ms. Marguerite Larkin. It would 
appear that in the years prior to joining Kerry, Ms. Larkin was a Partner at Kerry’s former audit firm, 
Deloitte, and whilst there was personally responsible for the oversight and sign-off of Kerry’s 2014 and 
2015 annual audits.  


The Financial Reporting Council (FRC) specifically highlights ethical standards pertaining to this situation. 
While not in breach of these standards, nonetheless, Ms. Larkin’s appointment was recommended and 
approved by Kerry’s Board less than two years after her having signed-of Kerry’s 2015 financial statements. 
In our view, the timing of this decision somewhat stretches the Audit Assurance Ethical standards as 
prescribed by the FRC.

SIGNS OF WEAKENING CASH, P&L AND CASH TAX DIFFERENCES, A DSO BOOST 


Kerry’s Free Cash Flow generation appears to have weakened somewhat over recent years. In nominal 
terms, we calculate that Kerry’s FCF peaked in 2016 at €569.9m and declined to €446.5m in 2018. Cash 
conversion from EBITDA appears to have fallen from 65% in 2016 to 47% in 2018.  


As we mention, Kerry’s cash tax paid has, in our view, been markedly lower than its adjusted tax stated in 
its P&L statement since 2013. Our concern is that were it not for a deferral of c. 50% of Kerry’s P&L tax 
each year, then FCF might have been weaker. Another of our concerns is that if Kerry’s cash tax was paid 
at the statutory rate then Kerry’s profits may be inflated. For example, if in 2018, Kerry’s €46.1m in cash 
tax paid accurately reflected the Irish Standard Rate of Tax of 12.5%, then this would imply that the 
corresponding profit before tax (PBT) would have been €368.8m in 2018. This compares to adjusted PBT 
on Kerry’s P&L of €684.8m, an implied potential overstatement of €316.0m in 2018.  


Kerry’s cash generation also appears to us to have been somewhat reliant on it extending the time it takes 
to pay its suppliers. We calculate that since 2008, Kerry’s Days Payable Outstanding (DPO) have risen from 
83 days to 123 days. Put another way, had Kerry maintained its DSO and DPO at 2008 levels, then we 
believe that Kerry’s cash generated from operations (CGFO) would have been as much as €291m lower in 
2018; or 38%.

KERRY ACQUISITIONS 


Since 2010, Kerry has spent a cumulative €2,798m on acquisitions, of which €1,246m relates to brand related 
intangibles and €1,153m is attributable to goodwill. 


 
Figure 2 Kerry cumulative acquisition consideration and allocation to acquired asset base. Source: Kerry financial statements.   


During this time, while volume growth has increased revenue by 30%, pricing growth has been flat at 1%. 
Given such significant spend on brand related intangibles, we question the value of such brand value when 
pricing power is apparently lacking. A counter argument could be that without such brand value, pricing 
would have been worse over the same time period.

For a business as acquisitive as Kerry’s, we are surprised how little information is provided regarding the 
financial metrics of the businesses being acquired. For example, Kerry made 10 acquisitions in 2018, at a 
consideration of €502.2m. When it comes to valuation multiples paid for these businesses, the disclosure is, 
in our view, somewhat lacking.  


The only disclosure within Kerry’s 2018 financial statements is: 


From the date of acquisition, the acquired businesses have contributed €34.0m of revenue and 
€0.2m of profit after taxation attributable to owners of the parent to the Group. If the acquisition 
dates had been on the first day of the financial year, the acquired businesses would have 
contributed €206.9m of revenue and €10.1m of profit after taxation attributable to owners of the 
parent to the Group. 


From this information we calculate that Kerry collectively paid c. 2.4x revenue and c. 50x profit after tax 
for its 2018 acquisitions. However, in our view, this masks significant disparities between the financial 
metrics of the 10 businesses acquired (see Major 2018 Acquisitions).  


When on the rare occasions, in our view, still limited data is provided, it suggests that Kerry is buying 
relatively low margin businesses. Since 2010, Kerry has provided revenue and profit after tax contribution 
information from its acquisitions in four years; in 2011, 2015, 2017, and 2018. This disclosure would appear 
to reflect the fact that these years incurred significant acquisition spend. However, according to the 
information provided, the PAT margins of the businesses acquired in these years, collectively were: 


2011: 1.0% 


2015: 5.8% 


2017: 4.3% 


2018: 4.9% 


These PAT margins are generally at least half that of which Kerry was achieving at the time of acquisition; 
they average 4.0% as compared to Kerry’s average PAT margin of 8.1% during the period 2010 to 2018. 
Further, detail on the 2018 acquisitions is provided in figure 4.

Data unavailable for other years. Source: Kerry financial statements. ShadowFall estimates. 


We provide further detail in sections below regarding Kerry’s major acquisitions in 2015 and 2018 and the 
implications regarding the remaining businesses acquired in those years. However, in summary, we calculate 
that while Kerry’s major 2015 acquisitions of Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune® likely achieved a 
combined PAT margin of 12.8%, this would suggest that the remaining 7 businesses acquired in 2015 were 
loss making, with a combined Loss After Tax (LAT) margin of negative 10.4%. Similarly, we calculate that 
although Kerry’s major 2018 acquisition of Fleischmann’s Vinegar Company (FVC) likely achieved a PAT 
margin of 16.6%, that this would imply the remaining 9 businesses acquired in 2018, were loss making.

MAJOR 2019 ACQUISITIONS: ARIAKE USA AND SOUTHEASTERN MILLS 


In December 2018, Kerry announced its acquisitions of Ariake USA, the North American Business of 
Ariake Japan Co., and Southeastern Mills North American coatings and seasonings business (SEM).2 The 
total consideration for Ariake and SEM is expected to be €325m (completed Q1 2019). Ariake and SEM 
were reported to have annualised pro-forma third-party revenues of c. €125m, implying a price to revenue 
cost of 2.6x. We calculate that Kerry paid c. 13.7x EBIT for Ariake USA and c. 24.7x EBIT for SEM. 
However:  


1. From Ariake Japan’s filings, it appears that in Q4 2018, Ariake USA had gone ex-growth and 
that Ariake USA’s operating margin may have fallen by 890bps to 19.2% from the year prior.  


2. SEM appears to us to be a fairly unspectacular seasonings and coatings business, with c. €78m in 
revenue. We believe that 24.7x EBIT is an eye-watering valuation to pay for such a business. 


ARIAKE USA 


Ariake USA produces natural clean label savoury taste solutions derived from poultry, pork and vegetables 
at its facility in Harrisonburg, Virginia.  


SOUTHEASTERN MILLS (SEM) 


SEM manufactures coatings and seasonings at its strategically located manufacturing base in Rome, Georgia.  


ARIAKE JAPAN DISCLOSURE 


As appears to be a theme with Kerry, despite the total consideration paid being in the hundreds of millions 
of euros, the group provides relatively minimal information regarding the financial metrics of the acquired 
businesses. However, Ariake Japan Co., provides fuller details regarding its disposal of Ariake USA to 
Kerry.3  


According to Ariake Japan, Ariake USA reported to 31 December 2017 (see figure 8):  


• Revenue of $53.0m (€46.9m); 
• Operating income of $13.1m (€11.6m).  


Further, Ariake Japan discloses that it disposed of Ariake USA for ¥20Bn, implying Kerry paid c. $178.6m 
(€158.7m) for Ariake USA. This would equate to 3.4x sales, and 13.7x operating income.

IMPLICATION 1 


If the consideration for both Ariake USA and SEM totals €325m, then the above would imply that Kerry 
paid c. €146.4m for SEM, and that SEM is expected to contribute revenue of c. €78.1m. Further, that Kerry 
paid c. 1.87x sales for SEM.  


SELL SIDE VIEWS 


According to a Sell Side research report on the Ariake USA and SEM acquisitions, the combined businesses 
are estimated to currently generate a trading margin that is slightly lower than Kerry’s Taste & Nutrition 
(T&N) division. Kerry’s T&N division reported a trading margin of 15.3% in 2018. However, Ariake was 
expected to achieve an above T&N margin, due to its specialised extraction technology. Further, that the 
Ariake USA and SEM purchases would contribute just below 1% to Year 1 EPS.  


IMPLICATION 2 


On the basis of the disclosures by Ariake Japan for the Ariake USA business and the assumptions in the 
market from the Sell Side, we are able to extrapolate a calculation for the performance of SEM and its 
corresponding valuation paid by Kerry. This calculation can be seen in figure 9 and it implies that Kerry 
paid almost 25x EBIT for the SEM business.  


In our view, paying 25x EBIT for a coatings and seasonings business seems high.

HAD ARIAKE USA GONE EX-GROWTH? 


Ariake Japan’s disclosures detailing the performance of Ariake USA showed that the business grew revenue 
by 21.8% to CY2017, and achieved an operating margin of 24.6% in the same period. However, at the time 
of its disposal to Kerry in early 2019, it appears that the Ariake USA business may have experienced a 
revenue decline of around 6.5% YOY and its operating margin having fallen to 19.2%.  


Figure 10 shows that in the 9 months to 31 December 2018, Ariake Japan reported its US based revenue as 
having declined from ¥4.12Bn (US$36.8m) to ¥4.01Bn (US$35.8m), or by -2.7% YOY. Further, the final 3 
months of CY2018 compared to the same period of CY2017, reported US revenue as having declined by -
6.5% YOY.  


In the final quarter of 2018, Ariake Japan’s US operating margin fell to 19.2% as compared to 28.1% a year 
prior.  


The full year revenue attributable to the US broadly reflects the same level of revenue as Ariake USA, which 
was sold to Kerry in February 2019. We believe this suggests that Kerry acquired the Ariake USA business 
at a point when its revenue was in decline and its operating margin had fallen by 890bps.

Figure 11 also illustrates that historically, Ariake Japan’s US based revenue had been somewhat volatile, 
although there is likely to be some currency drivers to this.

MAJOR 2018 ACQUISITIONS: FLEISCHMANN’S VINEGAR COMPANY AND AATCO 
FOOD INDUSTRIES 
In October 2018, Kerry announced its acquisitions of Fleischmann’s Vinegar Company, Inc. (FVC) and 
AATCO Food Industries LLC (AATCO).4 The total consideration for FVC and AATCO was reported as 
expected to be €365m. FVC and AATCO were reported to have annualised revenues of c. €150m. The deals 
were completed on 28 November 2018. As, in our view, is a trend with Kerry, the bare minimum details of 
the financial performance of each business were disclosed.

FLEISCHMANN’S VINEGAR COMPANY, INC (FVC) 


FVC is a USDA certified producer and US nationwide supplier of concentrated and specialty vinegars. Since 
2010, FVC has changed ownership four times.5,6,7 


Just two years prior to Kerry’s purchase of FVC, it was purchased by Green Plains Inc. from Stone Canyon 
Industries for $258.3m (€246m) in October 2016, for somewhere between a 2.0x to 2.5x multiple of 
revenue.8 Stone Canyon itself had acquired FVC just one year prior.

In terms of profitability, Green Plains indicated that FVC was acquired on a forward sub-10x EBITDA 
multiple before any synergies. Further, that FVC had a “stable and predictable earnings stream”, and a 
“consistent earnings growth rate, well above industry average due to scale and scope of operation.” 


At the time of acquisition in October 2016, Green Plains detailed FVC as having sales of between $100m 
to $125m, with the business growing at 2% to 3%.9 This would imply sales of €95m to €119m, and on c. 9x 
EBITDA multiple, likely EBITDA of $27.7m (c. €26.4m).  


Around two years later in August 2018, Green Plains indicated that FVC‘s sales had experienced cumulative 
annual growth in revenue and EBITDA of 8% and 15%, respectively10, suggesting that FVC’s revenues had 
grown to between $108m to $135m (€96m to €120m) while EBITDA had risen to c. €32.4m. However, 
according to correspondence with Green Plains’ IR, around the time of its disposition, “FVC generated 
around $105m [€89m] of revenue annually”.

IMPLICATION 1 


The above would suggest that: 


• FVC has had four owners since 2010 and three since 2015.  


• FVC’s revenues appear to have grown relatively modestly, if at all, under ownership by Green Plains 
until its disposal to Kerry.   


• Green Plains, having purchased FVC in October 2016 for $258.3m sold the business two years later 
to Kerry for $353.9m; a $95.6m mark-up in value in two years.  


• When acquired by Green Plains, Green Plains attached $142.8m in goodwill and $94.5m in 
intangible asset value to FVC; $237.3m (€226m) combined.  


• When sold to Kerry, FVC’s net tangible asset value was $63.4m (€53.7m), implying Kerry ascribed 
$290.5m (€246m) in value to FVC relating to goodwill and intangibles.  


• Acquired by Kerry for $353.9m (€300m), if FVC was generating revenue of around $105m, then 
we calculate that Kerry paid c. 3.4x revenue for FVC.  


• Green Plains purchased FVC for sub 10x EBITDA multiple. Assuming this meant 9x, implies 
that FVC was achieving EBITDA margins of c. 25% at the time of acquisition in October 2016. 


• If FVC’s revenue was $105m, when Kerry acquired it and it remained at a c. 25% EBITDA margin, 
then this would imply Kerry paid a 13.5x EBITDA multiple.  


Kerry only disclosed the price paid and revenue expectation for the combined businesses of FVC and 
AATCO Food Industries LLC.  


 
Figure 18 Announcement of FVC and AATCO acquisitions. Source: Kerry RNS. 


IMPLICATION 2 


If Kerry paid $353.9m (€300m) for FVC, then this implies €65m was paid for AATCO. Further, if FVC was 
achieving $105m (€89m) in full year revenue, then this would imply that AATCO was achieving €61m in 
full year revenue and that Kerry paid 1.06x sales for AATCO.  


AATCO FOOD INDUSTRIES LLC (AATCO) 


Headquartered in Muscat, Oman, Kerry describes AATCO as a leading provider of culinary sauces to the 
food service channel. There is little information available regarding AATCO, other than an Owler reference 
which estimates AATCO’s revenue at $16m (€14.2m), although without any reference date.11 However, this 
Owler estimate would obviously contradict the estimate above which suggest that AATCO’s revenues are 
over 4x this level.

22 


OTHER ACQUISITIONS OF 2018 AND IMPLICATIONS 
We calculate, excluding FVC and AATCO, the other 8 businesses which Kerry acquired in 2018, would be 
expected to contribute c. €56.9m in full year revenue. Further, that this would imply that these businesses 
were acquired for c. 2.4x revenue.  


What we find more interesting is that when excluding FVC, we calculate that the remaining 9 businesses 
acquired by Kerry in 2018, would have been loss making by c. €4.7m in 2018.  


Kerry states that if acquired at the start of its 2018 financial year then the 10 acquisitions would have 
contributed €10.1m of profit after taxation. However, if FVC was achieving a c. 25% EBITDA margin as 
per Green Plains’ indication above, and FVC’s D&A was in line with Kerry’s at c. 2.7% of sales, then at a 
20% tax rate, this would suggest that FVC would contribute c. €14.8m in profit after tax in 2018. Therefore, 
the remaining 9 businesses would be expected to contribute a combined loss of €4.7m.  


While FVC appears to be a good quality business, it does seem to us that FVC’s contribution somewhat 
conceals the combined losses of the other 9 remaining businesses which were acquired in 2018.  


Did Kerry really pay €202.3m for a group of businesses that combined lost €4.7m? 


We calculate that for the other 9 business to have made ZERO profits in 2018, would imply FVC 
would have to achieve an 18% EBITDA margin or lower. This would put the acquisition multiple 
paid by Kerry at c. 18.7x EBITDA, when Green Plains had paid sub 10x just two years earlier. We 
believe this is unlikely, supporting our view that Kerry paid €202.3m for 9 business that made less 
than ZERO profits.

FURTHER IMPLICATIONS 


As per Green Plains disclosures, when FVC was sold to Kerry, Green Plains reported that FVC had $64.6m 
(€54.7m) in PPE, and $63.4m (€53.7m) in net tangible assets.

24 


However, when Kerry reports the combined assets and liabilities contributed by its ten acquisitions in 2018 
it highlights a PPE contribution of €79.8m and a net tangible asset addition of €54m. But if FVC had €54.7m 
in PPE and €53.7m in net tangible assets then this would imply that the nine remaining businesses acquired 
contributed €25.1m in PPE and €0.3m in net tangible assets.  


Did Kerry really pay €202.3m for a group of businesses which combined had less than ZERO profits 
(estimated losses of €4.7m) and had just €0.3m of net tangible assets between them?

MAJOR 2015 ACQUISITIONS: RED ARROW PRODUCTS, ISLAND OASIS, 
WELLMUNE® 
In October 2015, Kerry announced its acquisitions of Red Arrow Products (Red Arrow), Island Oasis, and 
Biothera Inc.’s Wellmune® (Wellmune®).12 The total consideration for the three businesses was reported 
as US$735m (c. €677m). Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune® were reported to have annualised 
revenues of US$301m (c. €249m) and EBITDA of US$59m (c. €49m) in 2014. The deals were completed 
on 22 October 2015.13

OTHER ACQUISITIONS OF 2015 AND IMPLICATIONS 


Assuming Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune®’s combined revenues and EBITDA remained stable in 
2015, we calculate, excluding these three businesses, the remaining 7 businesses which Kerry acquired in 
2015 would be expected to contribute c. €126.4m in full year revenue. Further, that this would imply that 
these businesses were acquired for c. 1.7x revenue. However, what we find more interesting is that when 
excluding Red Arrow, Island Oasis and Wellmune®, we calculate that the remaining 7 businesses acquired 
by Kerry in 2015, would have been loss making by c. €13.1m in 2015. While Red Arrow, Island Oasis and

MAJOR 2011 ACQUISITIONS: WHAT DID KERRY BUY FOR €386.4M? 
In 2011, Kerry spent €386.4m on 14 bolt-on acquisitions. When accounting for what appear to be 
the three largest acquisitions of 2011, we calculate that Kerry paid €140.3m for an expected €17.2m 
full year revenue contribution from the remaining 11 acquisitions in 2011. This equates to 8.2x 
revenue. We are surprised to find such a lofty implied revenue multiple paid.  


REVENUE AND PRICES PAID OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES 


The greatest acquisition expenditure in 2011 was attributable to the purchase of Cargill Flavour Systems 
(CFS), for €172.6m in cash.14,15 With regards to CFS, Kerry states the following (our bold for emphasis): 


Due to the fact that CFS was acquired near the end of 2011, the revenue included in the Group’s 
reported revenue is not material and loss after tax and acquisition related costs included in the 
Group results was €3m. In a full year CFS is expected to contribute revenue of €142.9m.16 


Kerry also indicates:  


The main acquisitions contributed revenue of €56.6m to the Group in 2011. If these acquisitions 
had been completed on 1 January 2011, total Group revenue for the year would have been 
€5,507.1m.17 


AN 8.2X REVENUE MULTIPLE? 


Kerry’s total revenue was €5,302.2m in 2011. If 2011’s acquisitions had contributed €56.6m to this reported 
figure, then we calculate that excluding this contribution, Kerry’s revenue would have been €5,245.6m.18  


As Kerry mentions, if the main acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2011, then total revenue 
would have been €5,507.1m in 2011. We calculate this to imply that these acquisitions would have 
contributed €261.5m in revenue for a full financial year.19 


Whereas Kerry discloses the price it paid for CFS as €172.6m, and CFS’s expected contribution to revenue 
of €142.9m in a full year, it does not disclose the price paid nor any other individual revenue contribution 
by any other acquisition.  


Among the 14 acquisitions of 2011, the following businesses were also acquired:  


• SuCrest GmbH, domiciled in Germany, a provider of sweet ingredients; and  
• Headland Foods Limited, domiciled in the UK, a manufacturer of frozen customer branded 


ready meals.

• €53.6m for SuCrest GmbH20; and 
• £17.3m or €19.9m for Headland Foods.21

As detailed above, in 2011, corporate filings show that Kerry paid a total of: 


• €172.6m for CFS;  
• €53.6m for SuCrest GmbH; and 
• €19.9m for Headland Foods Limited.  


In total, Kerry appears to have paid €246.1m for the three businesses.  


In terms of 2011 revenue, these three businesses either reported or were expected to achieve as follows: 


• €142.9m for CFS;  
• €42.8m for SuCrest GmbH; and  
• €58.7m for Headland Foods Limited.22  


Total reported or expected revenue for the three businesses was €244.3m.  


Since Kerry paid a total of €386.4m for the 14 acquisitions it made in 2011, and as highlighted above, 
€246.1m of this related to payment for CFS, SuCrest, and Headland Foods, then we calculate that the 
remaining €140.3m must relate to the other 11 acquisitions.  


On the basis that a full year’s revenue contribution from Kerry’s 2011 acquisitions would have contributed 
€261.5m (as calculated above) and that either reported or expected revenue related to CFS, SuCrest, and 
Headland Foods was €244.3m, then we calculate that the remaining 11 acquisitions would have contributed 
€17.2m to 2011’s full year revenue. 


We calculate that Kerry paid €140.3m for an expected €17.2m full year revenue contribution in 2011. This 
equates to 8.2x revenue. We are surprised to find such a lofty implied revenue multiple paid. Kerry trades 
on c. 2.7x revenue23. Further, an 8.2 x revenue multiple seems elevated when also considering that Kerry 
paid: 


• c. 1.2x revenue for CFS;  
• c. 1.3x revenue for SuCrest GmbH; and  
• c. 0.3x revenue for Headland Foods

COMBINED LOSSES OF €0.9M? 


Aside from the seemingly lofty revenue multiples paid for some of Kerry’s 2011 acquisitions, the profitability 
of these businesses also, in our view, appears weak. For example, Kerry highlights (our bold for emphasis): 


During 2011 after allowing for acquisition related costs the main acquisitions contributed a 
loss after tax of €10.8m. If these acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2011, the Group 
profit after tax would have been €370.6m.24 


Kerry reported a profit after tax of €360.7m in 2011. If the 2011 main acquisitions had contributed a loss 
of €10.8m to this reported figure, then we calculate that excluding this contribution, Kerry’s profit after tax 
would have been €371.5m.25

As Kerry mentions, if the main acquisitions had been completed on 1 January 2011, then total profit after 
tax would have been €371.5m in 2011. We calculate this to imply that these acquisitions would have 
contributed a loss after tax of €0.9m for a full financial year.26 


Expenditure of €386.4m on acquisitions in 2011 seems to us as somewhat high considering the combined 
losses that we calculate would have been attributable in a full financial year to those acquisitions.  


GOODWILL OF €110M ASSOCIATED WITH €17.2M OF ANNUALISED REVENUE? 


Another feature of the 2011 acquisition spend is the asset base that appears to have been acquired. Kerry’s 
2011 annual filings detail CFS as reporting €52.8m in total identifiable assets prior to acquisition. A review 
of SuCrest’s annual filings reveals that it reported €7.9m in total identifiable assets in its financial year to 31 
December 201127. Further, Headland Foods details within its 2011 annual filings that it disposed of £12.0m 
in tangible fixed assets and £5.3m in stock (€19.9m combined). Given that Kerry reported total identifiable 
assets of €110.9m for CFS and €110.9m for its 13 other acquisitions before combination, this would indicate 
that excluding CFS, SuCrest and Headland Foods, the eleven remaining acquired companies had combined 
identifiable assets of €30.4m. On the basis that we calculate €140.3m was collectively paid for these eleven 
businesses, it would appear that c. €110.0m was attributable to Goodwill.  


As we calculate above, €110.0m in Goodwill for businesses which we estimate would contribute €17.2m in 
annual revenue, strikes us as a lofty valuation. Post-acquisition, a sizeable portion (€123.2m) of Goodwill 
appears to have been adjusted to reflect value attributable to “Brand related intangibles”.

26 Calculated as loss after tax excluding the acquisition contribution of €371.5 million (as calculated in the note above) less 
€0.9 million equals €370.6 million stated as the event if the acquisitions had contributed a full financial year’s revenue. Hence, 
the full year contribution from the acquisitions would have been a loss of €0.9 million.  
27 This figure was also echoed by Kerry Ingredients’ GmbH 2012 Annual Filing which took ownership of the SuCrest GmbH.

QUALITY OF ACQUISITIONS: SUCREST GMBH 


From the 2011 acquisitions detailed above, which we calculate would 
have contributed combined losses after tax of €0.9m in a full financial 
year, SuCrest appears to be one of the more sensible acquisitions. We 
say sensible due to the fact that SuCrest was profitable in 2011.  


SUCREST GMBH 


Kerry acquired SuCrest in October 2011 for €53.6m. SuCrest reported 
revenue and EBIT of €42.8m and €4.4m respectively to 31 December 
2011; revenue was at a seven-year high. The acquisition was described as 
“significantly expanding the Group’s sweet ingredients & flavours 
business in the EMEA region”.  


Five years after its acquisition and there does not appear to have been 
much of an expansion28. By contrast, SuCrest’s revenue has fallen by 
44% to €24.1m as at 31 December 2016.  


During the same period, when we separate out the reimbursed income 
received and costs allocated to other Kerry Group companies, we find 
that SuCrest’s EBIT has declined to €2.1m in 2016. I.e. SuCrest’s 
profitability has more than halved since Kerry acquired it. A review of 
SuCrest’s local filings highlights aggressive competition and difficulty to 
pass on price increases from increased costs.  


If SuCrest is an example of the general quality and success of Kerry’s 
acquisitions, then in our view, it is not an encouraging sign for such an 
acquisitive business.29  


                                                           
28 SuCrest GmbH’s Annual Filings are available to 31 December 2016. We expect 2017’s filings 
to be available in February 2019.

Figure 32 SuCrest GmbH revenue in the lead up to its acquisition by Kerry in 2011 and post-acquisition, € 
million. Source: SuCrest GmbH Annual Filings, www.bundesanzeiger.de


29 To be clear, there has been no “cherry-picking” of acquisitions to find those that have 
performed poorly. It is simply that SuCrest is the only acquisition where we could find financial 
information post-acquisition. Whether SuCrest is a wider reflection of Kerry’s other acquired 
companies is uncertain.

SUCREST GMBH: WIDER GERMAN ISSUES? 


Whilst reviewing the performance of SuCrest we would also highlight 
what appear to be more wide-spread competitive issues within the 
German market itself.  


Kerry Ingredients GmbH is a long-standing business in the German 
market. Kerry Ingredients’ revenue has fallen sharply from €71.2m in 
2011 to €45.2m in 2016. Admittedly a sharp decline was reported in 
2013, when revenue reportedly fell by €16.3m, which was largely due to 
the close of a plant in 2012. Nonetheless, in a similar fashion to SuCrest, 
Kerry Ingredients reports industry-wide pressures in key European 
export markets, high pressure on margins and limited growth potential 
in future years.  


Profitability at Kerry Ingredients also seemingly suffered around 2012 
and 2013, although has made some rebound more recently.  


When Kerry Ingredients reported the purchase of SuCrest it had 
indicated that it expected to receive synergy benefits on the cost side by 
combining certain administrative areas with SuCrest. However, it is not 
altogether clear to us where this has occurred.

KERRY VS. PEERS 


Kerry list a number of peers within its 
accounts.30 In our view, the main peers are:  


Givaudan – a Swiss manufacturer of 
fragrances and flavours.  


Glanbia – an Irish based producer of 
dairy, consumer foods, and nutritional 
products.  


International Flavors & Fragrances 
(IFF) – US manufacturer and supplier of 
flavours and fragrances.  


Symrise – a German listed producer of 
perfume oils, fragrances, ingredients, and 
flavourings.  


We believe the best peer is Glanbia, 
principally due to the comparable lines of 
business and the clear discrepancy in 
EBITDA margins whereas Givaudan, IFF, 
and Symrise, achieve significantly greater 
margins than Kerry and Glanbia.

KERRY VS. PEERS 


As highlighted in figure 37, while Kerry 
has seemingly achieved improvements in 
its profitability per employee over recent 
years, it still falls short of peers.  


We calculate Kerry’s EBITDA per 
employee to be less than €40,000.  


This compares to IFF, Symrise and 
Givaudan which we calculate to achieve 
EBITDA per employee north of €50,000 
and in Givaudan’s case, over €70,000 per 
employee.

38 


CASH TAX VS. PEERS 
As we go into more detail below, since 
2013, Kerry’s cash tax paid has been 
around half of the figure reported on its 
P&L statement.  


When compared to Kerry’s peers this 
shortfall in cash tax paid compared to P&L 
reported tax appears to be an outlier. 


It’s unclear to us why Kerry consistently 
pays significantly less tax than it reports. A 
Financial Times journalist, Dan McCrum, 
apparently queried the company on this in 
an article from July 2016: 


“So, why is the €68m total for tax paid 
on the cash flow statement for the last 
two years less than half the bill 
described on the income statement? 


Answer: investment, of a type which 
defers tax payments in a way which 
before 2014 it had not.” 


Assuming this to be accurate, we find this 
unusual for three reasons: 


1. Kerry’s lower cash tax compared to 
P&L tax appears to have begun to 
diverge from 2011/12. 


2. Why do Kerry’s peers not use this type 
of investment to defer their tax? 


3. For how much longer can Kerry defer 
its tax?

39 


CASH TAX VS. PEERS 


The cash tax against P&L tax disparity 
between Kerry’s peer group is, in our view, 
more apparent on a cumulative basis.  


During the period 2013 to 2018, Kerry 
reports a cumulative total of €505.2m in 
tax within its P&L statement. This 
compares to a cumulative total of €263.2m 
in tax paid within Kerry’s cash flow 
statement over the same period.  


This implies that during the period 2013 to 
2018, Kerry has paid in cash terms c. 
52.1% of the tax it has reported in its P&L.  


Over the same period, Kerry’s peers pay in 
cash between 78% (IFF) to 108% 
(Symrise) of the actual tax reported on 
their respective P&L statements.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS VS. PEERS 


Kerry has incurred significant 
restructuring costs during the decade past. 
For example, in 2012 and 2013, Kerry 
incurred a combined €345m in 
restructuring charges. In 2018, a further 
€44m was incurred.  


Cumulatively, Kerry has incurred €556m 
in restructuring charges since 2009.

BANG FOR BUCK VS. PEERS 


Kerry has achieved good EBITDA margin 
progression since 2009. Its EBITDA 
margin has risen from 11.5% in 2009 to 
14.3% in 2018; or by 24%.  


Kerry’s peers have also reported EBITDA 
margin progression during this period. 
However, we note that margins have fallen 
at Givaudan, IFF and Symrise over the last 
two years, whereas Kerry and Glanbia 
have seemingly been able to withstand 
margin pressure.  


Our question is: was Kerry’s €556m in 
restructuring costs since 2009 a principal 
driver of its margin improvement? 


It seems to us that peers’ restructuring 
efforts have driven greater returns.

RESTRUCTURING COSTS VS. 
ACQUIRED REVENUE 
Kerry has spent a cumulative €3,075m on 
acquisitions since 2009. We calculate at an 
average price to revenue cost of 1.9x, that 
Kerry has acquired c. €1,618m in revenue 
during this period.31  


Cumulative restructuring costs, which 
according to Kerry, typically relate to 
acquisition integration and restructuring, 
have totalled €556m since 2009.  


This implies that cumulative restructuring 
costs as a percentage of cumulative 
estimated acquired revenue equates to 
34% since 2009. In our view, this is a 
remarkable percentage of estimated 
revenue acquired spent on restructuring.

BANG FOR BUCK VS. PEERS 


Since 2009, despite incurring €556m in 
restructuring costs, we calculate that 
Kerry’s incremental increase in EBITDA 
margin, has resulted in a cumulative 
increase in EBITDA of €847m.  


Seemingly, Kerry’s incremental EBITDA 
return on restructuring costs incurred is 
1.52x.32 


By contrast, since 2009, Givaudan has 
spent a cumulative €294m on 
restructuring, and achieved a cumulative 
increase in EBITDA of €994m over the 
same period from its EBITDA margin 
progression.  


Givaudan’s incremental EBITDA return 
on restructuring costs incurred would 
appear to be 3.38x33; i.e. apparently twice 
as effective as Kerry’s.

R&D LOWER VS. PEERS 


The market appears to view Kerry as 
having migrated its revenue base into 
higher value flavourings and ingredients 
markets.  


However, it is noteworthy, how Kerry’s 
Research and Development (R&D) 
expenditure as a percentage of its sales, is, 
in our view, considerably lower relative to 
its peers.

On the basis of a seemingly lower rate of expenditure on

in order to enhance existing and develop new ingredients
and flavourings?

CAPEX INLINE VS. PEERS 


While Kerry’s R&D spend as a percentage 
of its sales is, in our view, markedly lower 
than its peers. Capex as a percentage of 
sales appears to be in line with peers.  


Of course, R&D is expensed whereas 
Capex is capitalised and does not pass 
through the P&L.  


If Kerry is possibly underspending on 
R&D, are acquisitions vital for new 
flavourings and ingredients?

DISPOSALS WHICH APPEAR TO CONTRADICT THE PURCHASER’S FILINGS?
ShadowFall Capital & Research LLP. All rights reserved. This document may not be reproduced or redistributed in whole or in part without prior written permission 
from ShadowFall Capital & Research LLP.  


 
47 


THE DISPOSALS 


In our view, Kerry’s disclosure on its disposals is as hazy as that relating to its acquisitions. We 
discuss below the two main disposals that Kerry has made in recent years, both of which occurred 
in 2015 and reportedly reaped a sizeable cash inflow of €115.7m.  


Our concern with these disposals, is that, following our analysis of the respective disposal 
companies and acquiring companies’ filings, we find what appear to be some contradictions. If the 
purchaser’s filings are an accurate reflection of events, then it might suggest that Kerry’s 2015 and 
2016 financial statements contain inaccuracies, or vice-versa. If so, we believe this could present an 
issue for Kerry, since it was its current CFO who appears to have performed the audit and sign-off 
of Kerry’s financial statements in those years. An alternative explanation for the contradictions may 
relate to tax planning, however, this may open further questions with adverse implications.  


TWO MAJOR DISPOSALS 


Acquisitions and Disposals  


During the year, the Group completed 10 acquisitions at a net cost of €888.1m. The Group also 
disposed of the Pinnacle lifestyle bakery business in Australia and the Consumer Foods 
Direct-to-Store business in the UK. The total consideration was €153.8m before disposal 
related costs. 


Kerry Group 2015 Financial Statements 


The disposal related costs equated to what we view as an eye-watering €38.1m and appear to have been cash 
costs, resulting in a net cash receipt of €115.7m from the disposals.  


THE DIRECT-TO-STORE DISPOSAL 


Kerry Group disposed of its Direct-To-Store business, which traded as Kerryfresh, in early 2015. On 
the basis of our research below, we believe that the Direct-To-Store (DTS) disposal contributed no 
more than a cash consideration of £0.94m (€1.3m) to Kerry Group in 2015.  


The MBO appears to have been led by Mr Darren Haynes34, who according to a LinkedIn profile 
had worked for Kerry Foods since 1999. Filings suggest that Mr Haynes, funded a significant 
£16.0m cash subscription to capitalise the disposed business, DTS, in 2015. Following Mr Haynes 
personal insolvency in 2017, and the DTS business’ Administration in 2018, it is unclear why DTS had an 
outstanding loan to Kerry Group of £1.0m at the point of Administration. For context, this loan value 
equated to 163% of the DTS’ cash balance at a time when presumably access to cash would have been 
critical for a business facing administration.

Kerry appears to disclose very little surrounding the disposal by MBO of its Direct-To-Store (DTS) business 
in 201535,36,37. Darren Haynes is described as having led the MBO of the DTS business, which traded as 
Kerryfresh38,39 (under Kerry) and changed its trading name to Fresh to Store Limited, a UK based company 
incorporated on 9 January 201540 - when as a separate entity.  


Fresh to Store’s ownership was transferred to a UK based holding company, F2S Holdings Limited. F2S 
Holdings was incorporated on 1 May 2015 and its accounts detail that the group is controlled by Darren 
Haynes as the majority shareholder.  


Although Kerry does not detail the name of its disposal in 2015 – describing it as an MBO of its Direct-To-
Store business – we have assumed that Kerryfresh/Fresh to Store, which was acquired by an MBO in the 
same month (February 2015) as the Direct-To-Store disposal, is the business that Kerry refers to.  


Further, there is the fact that within its 2015 financial statements Fresh to Store discloses: 


On 31 January 2015 the company [Fresh to Store Limited] acquired the trade and assets of 
Kerry Foods Limited. 


The purchase of trade and assets was reported to have been for a cash outflow on acquisition of £943,011. 
On this basis, we do not believe that the disposal of Kerry’s Direct-To-Store business in 2015 is likely to 
have contributed more than €1.3m to Kerry’s 2015 cash flow41. As a reminder, Kerry reports that it received 
a cash inflow of €115.7m in relation to the disposal of its Australian Pinnacle Bakery and its UK Direct-To-
Store businesses. If €1.3m was due to the DTS MBO, then this would suggest to us that €114.4m cash 
proceeds stemmed from the Australian Pinnacle Bakery Business.  


                                                           
35 The disposal of its Direct-To-Store business is mentioned three times within Kerry’s 2015 annual filing. The actual business that was 
disposed of is not specifically mentioned by name. What is detailed is that it was a management buyout in the UK completed at the end of 
February 2015.

Fresh to Store fell into administration in March 201842.  


Aside from the apparent de minimis proceeds that Kerry received from the sale of its DTS business, several 
other factors from the transaction seem to us to be somewhat unusual.  


FURTHER FEATURES REGARDING THE TRANSACTION WHICH WE FIND UNUSUAL 


DARREN HAYNES 


According to Fresh to Store’s and F2S Holdings’ filings with UK Companies House, Fresh to Store was 
capitalised in February 2015 by £15,949,059. This was raised by the issue of 48 ordinary shares and 
15,949,011 deferred shares. The deferred shares were entitled to receive the priority payment of any 
dividend.  


Through its Fresh to Store’s holding company, FS2 Holdings, these shares were ultimately held by Mr 
Darren Haynes, as shown in figure 47. 


                                                           
42 The Administrator’s Report from June 2018 indicates that Fresh to Store’s administration was driven in part by the withdrawal of credit 
insurance cover on Fresh to Store, and its exposure to both Palmer and Harvey and Poundland.

As highlighted above, prior to the MBO of Fresh to Store, Darren Haynes worked for Kerry for over 15 
years. As such, it is unclear to us from where the funding for Mr Haynes’ subscription of £15,949,059 in 
deferred shares originated. According to the UK’s Insolvency Service43, Mr Haynes entered into an 
Individual Voluntary Insolvency Arrangement on 11 January 2017.  


REVENUE IMPLICATIONS 


The DTS business was reportedly a disposal made by Kerry Foods Limited44,45 (Kerry Foods). When under 
its new ownership, the DTS business reported sales of £84.2m in the 45 weeks to 31 December 2015. 
Further, it highlighted that this was 15% higher than for the same period under Kerry’s ownership46. This 
would suggest that under Kerry’s ownership the DTS achieved c. £73.2m in sales during the 45 weeks to 
31 December 201447.  


Kerry Foods reported a revenue decline of £127.5m or 23.5% YOY to 31 December 2015, from £542.8m 
in 2014 to £415.3m in 2015. Assuming £73.2m of this revenue decline related to the disposed revenues of 
the DTS business would imply that excluding DTS, Kerry Foods’ revenue declined by £54.3m. This would 
suggest that Kerry Foods’ revenue fell organically by c. 13.5%YOY in 2015. We also calculate that Kerry

Foods’ revenue fell by 9.8%YOY in 2016. We interpret this to mean that despite the disposal of the DTS 
business, Kerry Foods experienced significant revenue pressure in 2015 and 2016.  


A LOAN TO KERRY GROUP 


According to the Administrator’s Progress Report, filed with UK Companies House on 24 October 2018, 
amongst the DTS business’ assets was a loan that the company had made to Kerry Group. This loan totalled 
£984,215, and is not far away from its original purchase consideration of £949,011. It is unclear to us why 
DTS, which entered administration, made a loan to Kerry Group totalling 24% of its reported cash balance 
at 31 December 201648, and 164% of its reported cash balance at the point of its administration49.

DISCREPANCIES DOWN UNDER: THE PINNACLE BAKERY DISPOSAL 


Kerry Group reportedly disposed of its Australian bakery business, Kerry Pinnacle, in May 2015. 
From our research, we find a discrepancy in cash flows between the disposal receipts which Kerry 
reports and the cash flows it appears to have injected into the Kerry Pinnacle business shortly prior 
to its sale. This might suggest that contrary to the implied cash proceeds of €114.4m from the Kerry 
Pinnacle disposal, no more than €3.6m in cash was received by Kerry Group in 2015. Further to the 
uncertainty in cash proceeds we also find discrepancies between Kerry’s filings and those of the 
acquirer of Kerry Pinnacle, which feature contradictory share counts. An explanation for these 
discrepancies may be due to tax arrangements.  


KERRY PINNACLE PTY LTD. (KERRY PINNACLE) 


Kerry Pinnacle50 was incorporated on 13 November 2012 and purchased the bakery business assets from 
Kerry Ingredients Australia Pty Limited (Kerry Australia) and its controlled entities on 1 December 2012. 
There was reportedly no cash outflow on the acquisition of the assets made by Kerry Pinnacle. It was stated 
as being funded with the intercompany payables from Kerry Australia.51  


In the years following its incorporation to disposal, Kerry Pinnacle reported the key financial metrics detailed 
in figure 49.

KERRY INGREDIENTS (S) PTE LTD (KERRY SINGAPORE) 


Following a sale of assets to Kerry Pinnacle by Kerry Australia in late 2012, ownership of Kerry Pinnacle 
was by a Singaporean based company: Kerry Ingredients (S) PTE Ltd (Kerry Singapore). Kerry Pinnacle 
was sold by Kerry Singapore to a private equity buyer in May 2015. Kerry Singapore reported revenue of: 


2013: SGD$1.1m (€0.7m); 


2014: SGD$1.8m (€1.1m). Restated to SGD$28.6m (€17.0m) in 2015; 


2015: SGD$45.3m (€29.7m). Restated to SGD$43.4m (€28.4m) in 2016; 


2016: SGD$57.0m (€37.3m);  


2017: SGD$61.4m (€39.3m). 


Kerry Singapore is a relatively small cog in the Kerry Group. Kerry Singapore’s revenue rose sharply post 
disposal of Kerry Pinnacle, apparently almost entirely driven by Agency Fee Income from related companies 
or Research and Development income. Sales of goods to third parties is de minimis.  


According to Kerry Singapore’s filings, it made an initial subscription of SGD$3 in 2012, for 3 shares in 
Kerry Pinnacle52,53. On 27 January 2015, four months prior to Kerry Pinnacle’s disposal, a further 
additional payment was made by Kerry Singapore into Kerry Pinnacle. This payment is detailed as totalling 
SGD$196.5m (€128.8m) for an additional 1 ordinary share in the share capital of Kerry Pinnacle54 (see 
figures 50 and 51). Somewhat oddly, in our view, despite this subscription, the share count in Kerry 
Pinnacle is not reflected as having increased from 3 to 4 within Kerry Singapore’s filings.  


Whereas Kerry Singapore states that it paid SGD$196.5m or AUD$196m for one additional share in Kerry 
Pinnacle, for the same share it would appear that Kerry Pinnacle states that one share had a value of 
AUD$67.2m. The description of events can be seen below and from the official respective company filings 
in figure 53. 


Kerry Singapore’s description of an additional share issue (our bold for emphasis): 


On January 27, 2015, the Company [Kerry Ingredients (S) Pte Ltd] acquired an additional 1 
ordinary share in the share capital of its wholly owned subsidiary, Kerry Pinnacle Pty Ltd, at a 
consideration of $196,453,697 (equivalent to AUD196,000,000). 


Kerry Pinnacle’s description of an additional share issue (our bold for emphasis): 


Prior to the sale of Pinnacle Bakery & Integrated Ingredients Pty Ltd [Kerry Pinnacle Pty Ltd] to 
PFG Bidco Pty Ltd, one share ($67,224,2350 was issued to Kerry Ingredients (S) Pte Ltd. 


On 29 May 2015, Kerry Singapore reports as having entered into a Share Sale Agreement (SSA) with a third 
party relating to the disposal of Kerry Pinnacle. Kerry Singapore details as having received SGD$202.1m 
(€132.4m) in cash associated with the disposal, which is reflected within Kerry Singapore’s statement of

cash flows. Kerry Singapore also reports a net loss of SGD$7.2m associated with the disposal. The above 
financials can be seen in figures 51 and 52 below.  


KERRY PINNACLE’S VERSION OF EVENTS 


Kerry Pinnacle’s filings appear to us to reveal a clear discrepancy of events as compared Kerry Singapore’s. 
Aside from the quantum of consideration for an additional share, Kerry Singapore reports that it held 3 
equity shares in Kerry Pinnacle through 2012 to 201555 while Kerry Pinnacle reports that it had 2 shares in 
issue through 2012 to 2014.56 Further, Kerry Singapore reports that it subscribed for that additional 1 equity 
share in Kerry Pinnacle on 27 January 2015; although noticeably it did not report a corresponding increase 
in its shareholding. Kerry Pinnacle reports the subscription of an additional share; however, it reflects the 
resultant increase in its share count from 2 to 3 shares.  


The implications of this is that contrary to Kerry Singapore’s reporting, which states that it transferred 
AUD$196m, if Kerry Pinnacle is to be believed, then AUD$67.2m was transferred, i.e. a discrepancy of 
AUD$128.8m or €88.2m. This is reflected in figure 53, which shows the respective filings of each company 
and the contradictions.

SUMMARY OF DISPOSALS 


Kerry reports that it disposed of its Pinnacle lifestyle bakery business in Australia and the Consumer Foods 
Direct-to-Store business in the UK during 2015 and that the total consideration was €153.8m before 
disposal related costs. These disposal related costs were reported to be what we view as an eye-watering 
€38.1m and were apparently a cash cost.57  


However, according to our research into these disposals: 


• The Direct-To-Store business was sold for a cash consideration of €1.3m.  
• It is unclear to us how the purchaser, a former Kerry employee of 16 years, of the Direct-To-Store 


business funded a capital injection of €21.9m into his newly acquired business. 


• Kerry injected €128.8m into Kerry Pinnacle four months prior to sale and received €132.4m at 
point of sale, i.e. a net receipt of €3.6m.  


• The purchaser of Kerry Pinnacle reports that contrary to Kerry’s filings of a €128.8m transfer, 
€46.0m was received.  


On the basis of the above, we are unable to reconcile c. €110.8m in cash reportedly received by 
Kerry Group in relation to its disposals. We also highlight the seemingly large €38.1m in cash 
disposal related costs.

KERRY’S CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ShadowFall Capital & Research LLP. All rights reserved. This document may not be reproduced or redistributed in whole or in part without prior written permission 
from ShadowFall Capital & Research LLP.  


 
59 


CORPORATE GOVERNANCE 
Since 2015, almost half of Kerry’s fifteen-member Board (at the time) have retired, including its 
CEO and Chairman. While, in our view, it would have been preferential to see at least one external 
appointment to the key positions of CEO and Chairman, in the event, Kerry appointed a CEO who 
had joined the Group through its graduate programme in1996 and a Chairman who has been with 
the Group since 2012, formerly Chairing its Audit Committee.  


While the appointment of Ms. Marguerite Larkin as Kerry’s CFO was external, it would seem that 
immediately prior to joining Kerry, as Partner at Kerry’s former audit firm, Deloitte, Ms. Larkin 
was personally responsible for the sign-off of Kerry’s FY2014 and FY2015 audits.  


In the light of the Audit Assurance Ethical standards as prescribed by the Financial Reporting 
Council (FRC), we have some unease with appointments such as Ms. Larkin’s to the important 
role of CFO. The FRC specifically highlights ethical standards pertaining to this situation58. The 
fact that Ms. Larkin’s appointment was recommended and approved by Kerry’s Board less than 
two years after Ms. Larkin having signed-off Kerry’s 2015 Financial Statements, in our view, is 
somewhat stretching the Audit Assurance Ethical standards as prescribed by the FRC.  


SEVEN OF FIFTEEN DIRECTORS HAVE RETIRED FROM KERRY’S BOARD SINCE 201559,60.  


Stan McCarthy, CEO since Jan 2008, Kerry graduate recruit in 1976, retired in Sep 2017; 


Michael Dowling, Chairman since Jan 2015, appointed to the Board in Mar 1998, retired in May 2018; 


Brian Mehigan, CFO since Feb 2002, joined Kerry in 1989, assumed the role of CSO in Sep 2018; 


Flor Healy, Kerry Foods’ CEO, Board Member since Feb 2004, retired in Aug 2017; 


Patrick Casey, Board since May 2014, retired in Apr 2017; 


Michael Ahern, Board since Jan 2014, retired in Dec 2016; 


James Devane, Board since Jan 2014, retired in Dec 2016; and  


John Joseph O’Connor, Board since Jan 2014, retired in Dec 2016. 


Kerry’s recently (May 2018) appointed Chairman, Philip Toomey, has been with the Group as an NED 
since 201261, and Chaired the Audit Committee since February 2015.  


Kerry’s CEO, Mr. Edmond Scanlon, was appointed CEO in October 2017. Mr. Scanlon has been with 
the Kerry since he joined in 1996 through its graduate development programme. Previous roles with Kerry 
include Vice President Mergers and Acquisitions, and President and CEO of Kerry Asia-Pacific.  


While age may be expected to have played a part in some of the retirement decisions, the fact that key new 
appointments have come from within the Group, is in our view a cause for concern. We believe that some 
“fresh eyes” may have been preferable for at least one of these key positions to have been appointed to a 
person with no former connection to the Group.

KERRY’S CFO IS ITS FORMER AUDITOR 


 
Figure 55 Kerry Group CFO appointment of Ms. Marguerite Larkin. Ms. Larkin had signed off Kerry Group’s accounts in the final two years of which 
Deloitte were its auditor in 2015 and 2016. Source: Kerry Group Annual Filings. 


As figure 55 highlights, in the final two years of Deloitte’s appointment as Kerry’s long-standing audit firm, 
Ms. Marguerite Larkin acted on behalf of Deloitte’s to sign-off Kerry’s Auditors’ Report in February 2015 
and 2016. Thereafter, Ms. Larkin was appointed as CFO to Kerry Group, assuming her role on 30 
September 2018, and was also appointed to Kerry’s Board.  


Regarding this appointment and its timing, we note the Financial Reporting Council’s (FRC), Audit and 
Assurance, Revised Ethical Standard 201662. The FRC highlights (our bold for emphasis): 


2.51 As required by legislation63, a natural person appointed as a statutory auditor or key 
audit partner for an entity subject to a statutory audit shall not take up:  


(a) any key management position;  
(b) membership of the entity’s audit committee;  


(c) membership of any body performing equivalent functions to an audit committee in 
relation to the entity;  


(d) any other position as director of the entity or, where the entity’s affairs are 
managed by a management body or other committee, membership of that 
management body or committee;  


before the end of:  


(a) in the case of a public interest entity, two years; and  
(b) in any other case, one year;  


beginning with the day on which the person ceased to be the entity’s statutory auditor or key audit 
partner in connection with the statutory audit of the entity. 


While Ms. Larkin did not assume the role of CFO and Board Membership with Kerry until 30 September 
2018, we note that Ms. Larkin’s recommended appointment was approved by Kerry’s Board on 19 February 
2018. This was less than two years after Ms. Larking having signed-off Kerry’s 2015 Financial Statements 
on 22 February 2016. In our view, this is somewhat stretching the Audit Assurance Ethical standards as 
prescribed by the FRC.

CASH CONVERSION 


Kerry reported its cash conversion to be 
72% in 2018 (2017: 83%).  





However, this is a conversion rate of FCF 
expressed as a percentage of adjusted 
earnings after tax.  





While Kerry’s measurement of its cash 
conversion has declined in percentage 
terms since 2016, we would note that when 
it comes to a more widely used measure of 
cash conversion, FCF conversion from 
EBITDA, that this has typically been 
below 60%.

CASH TAX 


For the seventh consecutive year, Kerry’s 
cash tax paid was, in our view, markedly 
lower than its adjusted tax stated in its 
P&L statement.  


Kerry reported €89.2m in adjusted tax on 
its P&L in 2018 (2017: €89.5m). However, 
in its cash flow statement, the Group 
reportedly paid €46.1m in cash tax in 2018 
(2017: €54.7m).  


Cash tax paid as a percentage of adjusted 
P&L tax totalled 52% in 2018 (61% in 
2017).

CASH TAX 


As figure 60 illustrates, in our view, the 
difference between the tax which Kerry 
reports and the actual cash it appears to 
physically pay has significant implications 
as to the perceived profitability of the 
Group.  


For example, if in 2018, Kerry’s €46.1m in 
cash tax paid accurately reflected the Irish 
Standard Rate of Tax of 12.5%, then this 
would imply that the corresponding profit 
before tax (PBT) would have been 
€368.8m in 2018. This compares to 
adjusted PBT on Kerry’s P&L of €684.8m, 
an implied potential overstatement of 
€316.0m in 2018.

CASH GENERATION APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN SOMEWHAT RELIANT ON PAYING SUPPLIERS LATER 


As figure 61 below highlights, since 2008, Kerry has seen a steady increase in its Days Payable Outstanding (DPO). Whereas in 2008 we calculate that Kerry’s 
DPO was 83 days, by 2018 this had increased to 123 days; a rise of 40 days or over an extra month. Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) has also increased, which 
would be expected to have adversely affected Kerry’s cash generation, however the increase in DSO of 6 days is relatively negligible as compared to the increase 
in DPO.  


As a result of this change in DSO and DPO, we estimate that Kerry’s cash flow has benefited by €291.4m in 2018, by seemingly paying its suppliers 40 days later 
and receiving cash from customers 6 days later, as compared to 2008 standard. Put another way, had Kerry maintained its DSO and DPO at 2008 levels, then we 
believe that Kerry’s cash generated from operations (CGFO) would have been as much as €291.4m lower in 2018; or by 38%.

KERRY TAKES ON A SOLUTION FOR 
IMPROVED PAYMENT TIMES? 


The extension of DPO is somewhat 
surprising to us as in 2014, Kerry renewed 
its e-Invoicing contract with Tungsten 
Network, a provider of e-Invoicing and 
invoice discounting solutions. The 
announcement highlighted that it would 
enable Kerry Group to “achieve straight-
through processing and improve payment 
on time for suppliers.” However, contrary 
to improving payment times for suppliers, 
DPO appears to have continued to steadily 
rise.  


Given that we estimate that DPO has risen 
to 123 days or 4 months, we would 
question as to whether there is further 
mileage in Kerry’s ability to continue to 
extend payment terms to its suppliers?
