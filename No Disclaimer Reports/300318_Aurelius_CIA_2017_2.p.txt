———-


In March 2017, we released a research report explaining our opinion
why Citizens Inc.’s business model is analogous to a Ponzi Scheme. 
The company uses a network of brokers to prey on unsophisticated
foreign families and retirees with false promises of
illusory “guaranteed returns” from insurance policies purportedly
secured by U.S. Treasury bonds.  But the money from policyholders
is funneled into continuous open market purchases of CIA shares,
arti�cially in�ating the company’s own stock price.


Over the past two years, Citizen’s �nancial condition has deteriorated
while executive resignations and a multitude of red �ags have
combined to suggest that the company’s scheme is increasingly
moving towards the verge of collapse.


Just weeks ago, Ernst & Young suddenly resigned as Citizens
auditor.


Now, three former senior executives have emerged as witnesses in
a recently �led lawsuit that exposes the depth of the alleged fraud
at Citizens (Review the Full Complaint Juan Gamboa vs Citizens,
Inc., U.S.D.C., W.D. Tex., Case No.: 1:17-cv-00241-RP amended on
July 31, 2017).


It is extremely likely that one of the witnesses is Randall H. Riley,
the son of the founder and controlling shareholder, Harold Riley. 


The detailed new allegations described in the complaint include how:

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/citizens-inc-former-senior-executives-describe-fraud-lies-irish-solution/ 3/8


Citizen’s former CFO discovered fraud and was �red after
reporting it and refusing to certify the �nancials.


Citizen’s former Chief Actuary was �red after reporting
actuarial issues to management.


Citizen’s reserve for tax non-compliance liabilities is de�cient
by at least $80 million, an amount that imperils the
company’s solvency.


In an attempt to save the company, management concocted
the “Irish Solution” which involved rushing to set up a secret
new subsidiary in Ireland before the IRS could audit Citizens.
Even though Citizens has failed to disclose having an Irish
subsidiary, records we obtained from the Irish Government’s
corporate registry prove its existence.


Citizens is now subject to ongoing IRS and SEC
investigations.


Citizen’s former CEO, Rick Riley, created an undisclosed and
illegal insurance policy that paid himself a six percent
guaranteed return. After it was discovered by the audit
committee, Citizens “lied and covered up” the self-dealing.


Accounting irregularities include mortgages and certain
receivables not paid since 2011 that weren’t even tested for
impairment.


Prior to Ernst & Young’s recent resignation, KPMG had
resigned as Citizens auditor due to undisclosed
disagreements with the company.


The three main witnesses supporting the complaint are seasoned
former Citizens executives with the following backgrounds:

We encourage investors to read the complaint in its entirety because
it both con�rms and adds signi�cant detail to the primary aspects of
our initial report. Not only do these new allegations point to
pervasive corruption within Citizens, but they also highlight the
company’s precarious �nancial position and management’s deceitful
efforts to keep the scheme alive.


Three elements of the second amended complaint we found
particularly illuminating include:


Citizen’s Former CFO and Former Chief Actuary Report Being Fired
After Uncovering Fraud and Lies


The complaint describes how the CFO refused to certify Citizens
�nancials after discovering a multitude of accounting, internal
control, �nancial reporting, and tax problems. He also discovered
that Citizens was continuing “misleading and fraudulent” marketing
practices.  After voicing his concerns that “this is fraud”, the
complaint says was �red without the audit committee even
addressing the issues he raised.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/citizens-inc-former-senior-executives-describe-fraud-lies-irish-solution/ 5/8


Similarly, the account of Citizens former Chief Actuary discusses
Citizen’s ongoing efforts to deceive policyholders and investors.   For
example, he discovered that: “the sales team was permitted to input
any stock projection information they wanted into marketing
documents and spreadsheets provided to their clients” (page 12).
After raising a multitude of concerns, including the legality of
funneling money from policyholders into Citizens stock, the
complaint says he was �red.


Citizens Creates a Secret Irish Subsidiary to Dodge Tax and Avoid
Insolvency (“The Irish Solution”)


In March 2015 Citizens inde�nitely disbanded its quarterly
conference calls after disclosing that most of its policies were not
compliant with U.S. tax law (known as 7702 noncompliance). 
According to the complaint, Citizens was aware that this put its
“entire business operations in doubt” because “current and future
policyholders suddenly found themselves on the hook for tax
payments which were and continue to be sold by brokers as tax-
exempt”.


During his 25 day tenure, the complaint explains how the now-former
CFO quickly discovered that Citizens reserve for its tax liabilities was
“de�cient by at least $80 million”.  To put this in perspective, our
initial report calculated that Citizen’s tangible equity was only $59
million with statutory equity (a regulatory capital calculation) of
approximately $90 million.  Thus, Citizens clearly can’t afford to
reserve this amount of money without risking insolvency.


But before the IRS could audit Citizens, management concocted
what was internally dubbed the “Irish Solution” of quickly forming a
subsidiary in Ireland in an effort to “avoid any U.S. tax liabilities and
regulations”.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/citizens-inc-former-senior-executives-describe-fraud-lies-irish-solution/ 6/8


The CFO voiced concerns that Citizens “could not simply avoid the
IRS by moving CICA to Ireland”, but the complaint states that a
Citizens executive declared that “if we don’t get the Irish solution,
we’re going to have to shut the doors”. Unsurprisingly, the complaint
elsewhere con�rms that Citizens is now under an IRS investigation.


Citizens has not disclosed the “Irish Solution” to investors and the
10-K speci�cally omits any reference to having an Irish Subsidiary.
However, we were able to corroborate the complaint’s assertions
with records (below) obtained from the Irish Government’s corporate
registry. The records prove the existence of a CICA Life entity in
Ireland (CICA is the name of Citizen’s primary operating business).

Self-Dealing and Accounting Irregularities


Other major new allegations in the complaint include how the
company “lied and covered up” Rick Riley’s creation of an
undisclosed insurance policy that paid himself a six percent
guaranteed return.


The complaint also highlights the CFO’s discovery that “certain
receivables had not been paid since 2011” and yet had not even
been tested for impairments (page 17).  We �nd this revelation
especially relevant because Citizen’s balance sheet carries $67
million in receivables related to policy loans.  These balances re�ect
a feature whereby the company is automatically paying premiums
for policyholders by making loans against the value of their
accounts.


Because Citizen’s policy loan receivables have surged by 80% over
the past �ve years to now exceed tangible equity, we have theorized
that they are being used by management as an accounting gimmick

to arti�cially suppress policy surrender rates and juice the �nancials. 
If the loans inside this portfolio are subject to undisclosed
impairments, then Citizens �nancial position might be even worse
than we initially believed.


The complaint states that Citizens is “currently under investigation
by the Securities and Exchange Commission” and that “eventually,
even the company’s auditors had seen enough and resigned”.  Prior
to E&Y’s recent resignation, the complaint reveals that KPMG had
resigned “due to a disagreement with some of Citizens executives”
(even though Citizen’s 8-k claimed it had dismissed KPMG and failed
to disclose any disagreements).
