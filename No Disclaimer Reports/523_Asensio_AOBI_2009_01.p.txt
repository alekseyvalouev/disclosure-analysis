AOB Deal Questionable Even Without
Undisclosed Relationship between Chairman and
Seller


Posted on August 5, 2009 by Asensio.com


As previously reported by asensio.com, American Oriental


Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE: AOB) paid nearly $105 million in two


separate transactions for Beijing-area property to a company that


appears to be an undisclosed related party. Click here to read the


prior asensio.com report.


However, even without evidence of an undisclosed related party,


many of the Wall Street analysts covering AOB were clearly


surprised by the $70 million Beijing property acquisition


announced in January 2009. Many of the analysts openly


questioned the company’s decision to make the $70 million


expenditure. None of the analysts, though, connected the $70


million transaction with the $34.9 million transaction that occurred


in the third quarter of 2008 and that appears to have been


conducted with the same related party.


A Piper Jaffray analyst wrote in a report dated January 8, 2009,


“AOB used approximately $70m to purchase resort-style properties.


We tried really hard, but still are not convinced that is a good use of


capital that was intended for pharma company/asset acquisitions.


We are downgrading the stock to Sell.”


An analyst from Brean Murray Carret & Co. stated in a report dated


January 12th that the purchase was “inconsistent with the


company’s core strength of pharmaceutical manufacturing and


marketing,” and that “a purchase of such magnitude is unnecessary,


in our opinion.”


Consistent with the Piper Jaffray analyst’s remark that the


properties were “resort-style,” a later report from Brean Murray,

he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

dated March 10th, shows photos of the property AOB acquired:


residential apartments, villas, and a club room.


AOB made no announcements to its US investors disclosing an


intention to purchase Beijing real estate prior to the $70 million


transaction that reportedly occurred on December 31, 2008, the last


day of the year. The 8-K announcing the $70 million transaction


does not include a purchase agreement and only offers an


explanation for the purchase by stating, “AOB intends to use the


properties as a Convention and Training Center.”


No disclosure is made in AOB’s press releases or SEC filings


concerning the ‘resort-style’ nature of the properties. AOB provides


no basic description of the ‘villas’ and residential apartments given


by analysts who visited the property.


The 8-K also does not offer an explanation of why AOB management


thought it necessary to spend $70 million on a convention and


training center in Beijing. AOB made no mention in press releases


of the $70 million transaction being connected to the prior $34.9


million transaction. Furthermore, there is no indication from AOB’s


SEC filings of whether the $34.9 million transaction for Beijing


Development Area property is also for the purpose of a “convention


and training center,” or even whether the $34.9 million was spent


on a property separate from the ‘resort-style’ property visited by


analysts.


AOB management apparently felt it necessary to issue a press


release two days after the January 8-K to give some justification for


the $70 million purchase. The press release, dated January 9, 2009,


states that the property transaction positions the company “to


secure government support in various forms.” Click here to see the


press release.


The press release did not elucidate what forms of government


support the company hoped to receive for its $105 million


expenditure or how the purchase of a “convention and training


center” from an apparent related private party would dispose the


Chinese government to provide extraordinary support to AOB’s


existing operations.


Describing the AOB property transaction, an Oppenheimer analyst


wrote, “While we wish the investment had been made in core


business acquisitions, the money didn’t disappear into thin air,” in a


report dated January 8, 2009.


Given the questionable commercial value to AOB’s business of the


property and what appears to be a less-than-arm’s-length


relationship with the seller, it remains to be seen whether or not


some of the money reportedly spent by AOB “didn’t disappear into


thin air.”
