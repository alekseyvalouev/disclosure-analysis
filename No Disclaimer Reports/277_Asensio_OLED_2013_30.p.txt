After losing claimed OLED leadership status,
Universal Displays tries nonsensical promote
with Philips.


Posted on November 26, 2013 by asensio.com


Tuesday, November 26, 2013.  Last Friday Universal Display


Corporation (“UDC;” NASDAQ: OLED) failed in the world’s largest


international court of law to support its “we own phosphorescence”


OLEDs claims.   So as if to prove the point that it really isn’t a leader,


after the close yesterday UDC issued a press release announcing


that it was going to provide samples of its OLED chemicals to an


existing OLED manufacturer, which has in the market among its


many already existing products an OLED lamp that sells for


US$336.38 on the web.  https://www.lumiblade-shop.com/index.php/


UDC’s loss could not have been more damaging or embarrassing. 


Previously UDC has used the lost claims to allege that it had made a


“revolutionary” and “dramatic breakthrough” that enabled the


commercialization of OLEDs. On every claim, UDC was found have


failed to provide a description of the invention; it did not tell a way


of making and using the invention so that an informed person


could make and use it themselves.  In plain terms the High Court


ruled that UDC’s most trumpeted claims were entirely nonexistent,


not simply without merit, or weak compared to others, but that


UDC’s claims were simply senseless.  The principle of law used the


by the European Union’s highest patent court that invalidated UDC’s


so called revolutionary patent has been adopted by the United


States under statute 35 USC paragraph 112 and other major


countries.


It appears that UDC’s press release was intended to mitigate the


damage to its reputation of the above described court order, which


has final effect in 28 countries at once that make up the world’s


largest market.  Before the loss, UDC had already acknowledged

that its business was competitive with some products already


becoming a commodity.  This raises questions about the wisdom of


distracting investors from focusing on whether Samsung will make


payment for its next semi-annual licensing fee.


UDC’s announcement did not contain a statement from the


customer or its contact information.

appears that UDC is not interested in highlighting that Philips
