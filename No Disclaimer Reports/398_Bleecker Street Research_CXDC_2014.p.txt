Summary


CXDC reports substantially margins higher than its main competitor, yet spends
much less on R&D.


China XD Plastics Company (NASDAQ:CXDC)


China XD Plastics is a Chinese specialty chemical company which is engaged in all
phases of the production of plastics, which are mainly used for automotive uses, and sells
to mainly the Chinese end-market.


CXDC entered the US public markets through a reverse merger, a method that many
fraudulent companies have previously used. Below is a summary of what we have found
researching CXDC.


Reported profit margins 200% higher than its larger and better funded competitor
Kingfa.


CXDC's Gross Margins Are Substantially Higher Than Its Much Larger Competitor


CXDC has incredible gross margins, if you believe them. CXDC's main publicly traded
competitor is Kingfa, which trades on the Shanghai Exchange. Kingfa is mentioned in
CXDC's 10-K as well, the 10-K reads:

Currently, Xinda Group's primary Chinese competitor in the automobile industry is
Guangzhou Kingfa Science & Technology Co., Ltd. ("Guangzhou Kingfa").
Guangzhou Kingfa entered the automotive modified plastics market in 2006 and its
facilities had an annual manufacturing capacity of 375,000 MT for its modified
plastics products used in the automobile industry at the end of 2012, according to
the research report by Frost and Sullivan. Guangzhou Kingfa has the largest
capacity expansion plans and was expected to expand to 1.06 million MT by
2015 according to Frost and Sullivan's report, but its utilization rate of
production capacity is expected to be lower than that of China XD based on
Frost & Sullivan's report. Guangzhou Kingfa has much larger financial
resources than Xinda Group. However, we believe that it currently holds fewer
number of product certifications for automotive modified plastic to the automobile
industry compared to Xinda Group. Another top domestic manufacturer of modified
plastic is Shanghai Pret Composites Co., Ltd. ("Shanghai Pret"), which focuses on
the production of automotive plastics. It had an annual capacity and sales volume of
120,000 MT and 73,100 MT in 2013, respectively, according to a report by Frost and
Sullivan.


According to that statement, it would make sense that CXDC, a much smaller company
with less resources, would have lower gross margins, after all there is an economy of
scale aspect to manufacturing plastics. CXDC, however, does not only have better gross
margins, but substantially better gross margins.


How much higher? Well from 2009 to 2013, CXDC reported gross margins that were
substantially higher than its main, better funded competitor.


And Kingfa is a much larger company, that generates billions of dollars in revenue.
Consider this, in 2013 CXDC generated 45% less revenues than Kingfa but reported net
income that was 184% higher than Kingfa. Since 2011 Kingfa has seen its net income
decline by 21% while revenues have grown 24%. On the other hand, CXDC has seen net
income grow by 133% and revenues grow by 175%.

One could argue, hypothetically, that CXDC has some sort of proprietary method of
manufacturing their product that allows it to report such high margins. CXDC's R&D
spending, however, has been relatively miniscule compared to Kingfa. According to this,
Kingfa invests 2-5% of their annual sales in R&D.

Bear in mind that Kingfa has a much larger sales number as well, so its R&D expenses
will be substantially higher than CXDC's.

So it is clear that CXDC is not outspending Kingfa on R&D to generate its higher margins.
Being conservative and using the low-end of Kingfa's R&D guidance range of 2% would
suggest that Kingfa is substantially outspending CXDC on R&D, yet somehow CXDC
manages to report higher margins?


All charts are my analysis from publicly available information.


A Curious Move By CXDC


CXDC announced the closing of its senior notes offering in February of this year.


China XD Plastics Company Ltd: Says that its wholly owned subsidiary, Favor Sea
Limited (the Issuer), closed its international offering of guaranteed senior notes. The
offering consists of $150 mln aggregate principal amount of 11.75 pct guaranteed
senior notes due 2019.Issuer intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for
repayment of indebtedness incurred by its PRC subsidiaries, for capital expenditure
on a production base in Sichuan and for general corporate purposes. The Notes are
guaranteed on a senior basis by the company and Xinda Holding (NYSE:HK)
company Limited, a subsidiary wholly owned by the Issuer and secured by a pledge
of the shares of the Issuer held by the company and a pledge of the shares of the
Subsidiary Guarantor held by the Issuer.


The notes carried a surprisingly high interest rate of 11.75%. More surprising was that they
were issued internationally. If the company, as it claims, is truly one of the leading
specialty chemical companies then why can it not issue debt in the country in which it
operates and why is it paying such a high interest rate when interest rates all around the
world are at historic lows.


Increasing DSO Is A Red Flag

DSO tells you how many days it takes a company to collect revenue after a sale.
Look out for increasing DSO as it means the company is unable to collect payments
and/or providing lenient terms to buyers. To put it simply, the company is disguising
weak sales.


Here is a chart of CXDC's DSO.

Passing The Smell Test? Don't Think So


In an article by Bill Bishop he gives us six things that are warning signs that a Chinese
stock may be a fraud. Let's apply this test to CXDC.

Our friends over at iChinastock (disclosure: I am an advisor to their parent company
Snowball Finance) have created a list of 5 Warning Signs That A Chinese Stock May
Be a Fraud:


1. Company went public through an OTCBB Transfer or other ways of back-door
listing;


2. Company name starts with "China" [unless they are state-owned they cannot
register a company in China starting the word "China"];


3. The products are sold in China, but there is minimal Chinese-language
information about those products;


4. The business defies common sense;


5. The underwriter, audit firm and accounting firm are second tier and/or have a track
record of missing frauds (like Deloitte China).


To this list I would add a sixth warning sign:


6. The CFO does not live in the same city as corporate HQ and is not a regular
presence there.


So how does CXDC stack up? Turns out not so well.


1. CXDC Fails. CXDC went public through a reverse merger.


2. CXDC Fails. "China XD Plastics" as you can see the name starts with China.


3. CXDC Fails. Searching Google reveals no Chinese links on the first page.

And perhaps more interestingly, CXDC does not have a Chinese-language website,
although it does have what appears to be a link to Chinese-language website the link does
not work and you stay on the English-language website. Compare this to Kingfa's
homepage.

Kingfa's website has an English version, but the main website is in Chinese and the
Chinese-language website is more advanced. How does CXDC have margins that are so
much higher than Kingfa's if it doesn't even have a website in the language of the

company that it does its main business in? Something doesn't add up.


4. CXDC Fails. CXDC not only defies common sense, it defies any rational explanation of
how business is done.


5. CXDC passes. Sort of. KPMG is CXDC's auditor. I believe they pass on this one but it
is interesting to note the relatively high turnover of auditors.

Also worthy of note is that CXDC's audit fees were remarkably low until KPMG began
doing the audit.

6. CXDC Fails. CXDC's CFO is based in New York City, at least according to his phone
number.
