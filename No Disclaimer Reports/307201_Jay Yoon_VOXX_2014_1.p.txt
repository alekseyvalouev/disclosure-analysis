VOXX	International:	Strong	Sell	Due	To	Questionable	Management
Practices	And	Deteriorating	Fundamentals
Oct.	8,	2014	2:12	PM	ET12	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


VOXX	management	appears	to	be	masking	deterioration	in	their	business	through
questionable	financial	reporting	and	forecasting	practices.


Continued	product	delays,	large	guidance	revisions	and	other	misplaced	statements
about	the	business	have	further	weakened	management's	credibility.


Based	on	recent	management	comments,	it	is	likely	that	VOXX	will	lower	its	FY
2015	guidance	by	a	meaningful	amount.


VOXX	shares	are	overvalued	by	as	much	as	70%	at	the	current	price	level.


360Fly	is	essentially	a	"lottery	ticket"	product	for	VOXX,	and	is	not	a	good	reason	for
investors	to	hold	onto	their	shares.


When	I	first	began	my	research	of	VOXX	International	(NASDAQ:VOXX),	I	originally
thought	VOXX	shares	might	make	for	an	interesting	long	opportunity.	On	the	surface,	the
Company	looks	cheap	from	a	valuation	perspective.	The	Company's	management
recently	guided	for	FY	2015	EBITDA	of	$55mm,	and	consensus	analyst	estimates	for	FY
2015	EPS	is	currently	$0.71	(as	per	Yahoo	Finance).	Based	on	these	estimates	and
VOXX's	closing	price	of	$9.37	on	10/6/2014,	VOXX	is	currently	trading	at	modest
valuation	multiples	of	5.6x	FY	2015	EV/EBITDA	and	13.2x	FY	2015	EPS.


My	opinion	on	VOXX	quickly	changed	after	reading	through	the	Company's	recent
earnings	reports	and	transcripts.	During	my	research,	I	discovered	that	VOXX's
management	has	a	troubling	history	of	misrepresenting	and	inflating	their	historical
financial	results	and	forecasts.	In	addition	to	management's	questionable	behavior,
VOXX's	business	fundamentals	have	deteriorated	over	the	past	year,	and	currently	show
no	signs	of	turning	around.	In	fact,	management	recently	hinted	during	their	most	recent
investor	presentation	on	September	23rd	that	they	would	be	lowering	guidance	for	FY
2015.	Due	to	management's	history	of	misrepresenting	their	financials	and	the	ongoing
deterioration	in	VOXX's	business,	I	believe	VOXX	is	overvalued	by	as	much	as	70%	at	the
current	share	price	of	$9.37.

VOXX's	FY	2015	Guidance	Raises	Severe	Red	Flags


The	first	major	red	flag	I	discovered	was	that	VOXX's	FY	2015	guidance	did	not	make
much	sense.	More	specifically,	the	Company's	FY	2015	EBITDA	guidance	did	not	appear
achievable	when	taking	into	account	management's	FY	2015	guidance	for	total	sales,
gross	margin	and	operating	expenses.	During	the	Company's	most	recent	Q4	2014
earnings	call,	management	stated	the	following:


"In	fiscal	'15,	we	see	top	line	sales	in	the	$825	million	to	$830	million	range.	Again,
with	some	potential	upside	that	I	will	revisit	when	we	get	to	the	second	half	of	the
year.	Gross	margins	are	projected	to	come	in	a	little	above	29%	for	fiscal	'15...
Overall,	operating	expenses	could	increase	about	4%	to	5%."


Based	on	the	sales,	gross	margin	and	operating	expense	guidance	provided	by
management,	I	calculated	the	implied	Adjusted	EBITDA	for	FY	2015.	These	calculations
can	be	seen	in	the	table	below:


As	illustrated	in	these	calculations	above,	FY	2015	EBITDA	should	be	~$47mm,	based	on
management's	guidance	for	total	sales,	gross	margin	and	operating	expenses.	However,
to	my	surprise,	on	their	Q4	2014	earnings	call,	management	provided	FY	2015	EBITDA
guidance,	which	was	significantly	higher	than	$47mm:


"I	expect	EBITDA	to	be	comparable	with	fiscal	'14	approximately	$54	million	to	$55
million."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 3/10


Naturally,	I	was	puzzled	as	to	how	management	came	up	with	an	EBITDA	projection	that
was	$7mm-$8mm	higher	than	mine,	despite	using	the	same	topline	and	expense
assumptions.	At	first,	I	thought	that	management	was	providing	guidance	for	Unadjusted
EBITDA	(which	includes	one-time	gains	and	losses)	rather	than	Adjusted	EBITDA.	This
appeared	to	be	a	logical	assumption,	given	management's	statement	that	FY	2015
EBITDA	would	be	in	line	with	FY	2014	Unadjusted	EBITDA	of	$54mm-$55mm	(FY	2014
Adjusted	EBITDA	was	$46.5mm).	However,	reading	the	following	discussion	between
management	and	Rob	Ammann	(from	RK	Capital)	during	VOXX's	Q4	2014	earnings	call
quickly	dispelled	that	notion:


Rob:	"I	guess	what	I	am	trying	to	understand	as	you	stand	right	now	without	knowing
if	there	is	going	to	be	any	puts	or	takes	is	it	fair	to	say	your	adjusted	EBITDA
guidance	is	$54	million	to	$55	million?"


Pat	Lavelle	(VOXX	CEO):	"EBITDA	and	adjusted	EBITDA"


Charles	Michael	Stoehr	(VOXX	CFO):	"Right	now,	we	are	starting	out	with	the	$55
million"


Rob:	"Okay,	okay.	So,	it's	the	same	for	both."


Pat	Lavelle	(VOXX	CEO):	"Correct"


Based	on	this	discussion,	it	is	clear	that	management's	FY	2015	EBITDA	guidance	is	for
Adjusted	EBITDA,	and	not	for	an	EBITDA	figure	which	includes	one-time	net	gains.	I	have
also	made	it	clear	that	based	on	management's	sales,	gross	margin	and	operating
expense	assumptions,	FY	2015	Adjusted	EBITDA	guidance	should	be	~$47mm.	Thus,	it
can	be	concluded	that	management	either	a)	intentionally	mislead	investors	by	providing
an	inflated	Adjusted	EBITDA	projection,	or	b)	has	a	very	poor	understanding	of	their	own
financials.	Both	of	these	scenarios	are	obviously	not	very	appealing	for	investors.	Also
troublesome	for	investors	is	that	FY	2015	Adjusted	EBITDA	of	$47mm	is	~15%	lower	than
the	$54mm-$55mm	that	management	guided	for.


VOXX	Management	Has	a	History	of	Misrepresenting	Financials


Based	on	recent	history,	I	believe	it	is	likely	that	VOXX	management	may	be	intentionally
misrepresenting	their	numbers	to	mask	deteriorations	in	the	business.	I	do	not	believe	that
seasoned	finance	and	business	professionals	could	have	such	a	poor	grasp	on	their	own
financials.	An	examination	of	prior	earnings	reports	over	the	past	year	reveal	an	alarming

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 4/10


tendency	by	management	to	inflate	their	historical	and	projected	financial	performance.
Consider	the	following	statement	regarding	FY	2014	net	income	provided	in	VOXX's	Q4
2014	earnings	report:


"The	Company	reported	a	net	loss	for	the	year	ended	February	28,	2014	of	$26.6
million,	which	includes	impairment	charges.	Excluding	impairment	charges,	net
income	for	the	year	ended	February	28,	2014	was	$31.0	million	or	net	income	per
diluted	share	of	$1.28	as	compared	to	net	income	of	$22.5	million	and	net	income
per	diluted	share	of	$0.95	for	the	comparable	period	last	year."


These	statements	regarding	FY	2014	results	are	misleading	for	a	couple	reasons.	First,
after	adding	back	the	$57.6mm	impairment	charge,	the	Company	states	that	FY	2014	net
income	was	$31.0mm,	or	$1.28	per	diluted	share.	The	issue	is	that	management	is	not
deducting	taxes	from	net	income	after	adding	back	the	impairment	charge.	By	excluding
taxes,	management	is	artificially	inflating	its	reported	FY	2014	net	income	results.	Thus,
actual	tax-effected	net	income	after	adding	back	the	impairment	charge	is	much	lower	at
~$19.5mm,	or	$0.81	per	diluted	share	(assuming	a	37%	tax	rate).	On	top	of	this,
management	concludes	its	discussion	of	net	income	by	comparing	its	tax-free	FY	2014
net	income	of	$31.0mm	to	its	fully-taxed	FY	2013	net	income	of	$22.5mm.	This	is
obviously	a	misleading	comparison	that	attempts	to	make	net	income	performance	look
better	than	it	actually	was	by	comparing	tax-free	FY	2014	results	to	fully-taxed	FY	2013
results.


Unfortunately,	management's	misrepresentation	of	the	numbers	does	not	end	there.	On
the	Company's	most	recent	Q1	2015	earnings	call,	management	made	another
questionable	statement	about	their	FY	2015	guidance.	This	time,	instead	of	providing	an
inflated	Adjusted	EBITDA	projection,	management	provided	what	appears	to	be	an
inflated	or	overly	optimistic	free	cash	flow	projection:


"Our	balance	sheet	will	continue	to	improve	this	year	and	everything	remains	in
place	to	pay	down	debt	and	generate	the	$40	million	plus	of	cash	flow	we
anticipated	entering	this	year."


GAAP	free	cash	flow	generation	in	FY	2014	was	$52mm,	but	that	included	almost	$40mm
in	one-time	net	gains.	For	example,	~$30mm	of	the	$40mm	in	one-time	net	gains	included
in	FY	2014	free	cash	flow	was	from	a	large	decrease	in	working	capital.	Swings	in	working
capital	can	go	either	way	in	a	given	fiscal	year.	Thus,	large	working	capital	swings	must	be
excluded	from	a	normalized	free	cash	flow	calculation.	On	a	normalized	basis,	excluding

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 5/10


one-time	gains	and	losses,	the	Company	generated	only	$13mm	of	free	cash	flow	in	FY
2014.	Thus,	given	that	management	has	guided	for	FY	2015	EBITDA	to	be	flat	relative	to
last	year,	management's	guidance	for	$40mm	of	FCF	does	not	make	much	sense.	This
means	that	management	may	have	overstated	their	free	cash	flow	guidance	by	over
$25mm!	The	table	below	provides	a	detailed	breakdown	of	how	I	calculated	VOXX's
normalized	FY	2014	FCF:


As	a	final	example	of	management's	penchant	for	providing	questionable	statements
about	their	financials,	let's	revisit	management's	comments	regarding	FY	2015	EBITDA
guidance:


"I	expect	EBITDA	to	be	comparable	with	fiscal	'14	approximately	$54	million	to	$55
million."


As	I	have	already	shown,	management	clearly	stated	that	the	FY	2015	EBITDA	guidance
they	provided	was	for	Adjusted	EBITDA.	Therefore,	it	is	puzzling	as	to	why	management
is	comparing	their	projection	for	FY	2015	Adjusted	EBITDA	to	an	FY	2014	Unadjusted
EBITDA	figure	which	is	inflated	by	~$8mm	due	to	significant	one-time	gains.	Given
management's	recent	history,	I	believe	that	they	may	have	intentionally	presented	an
inflated	historical	EBITDA	number	to	justify	their	overly	aggressive	EBITDA	target	for	FY
2015.


But	Wait…	There's	More!


In	addition	to	providing	misleading	numbers,	management	appears	to	have	a	very	poor
grasp	on	the	overall	business.	For	example,	on	January	8th	of	this	year,	management
raised	Unadjusted	EBITDA	guidance	for	FY	2014	from	$62mm	to	$65mm	when	they
reported	their	Q3	2014	earnings.	They	then	proceeded	to	miss	that	raised	guidance
number	by	~$10mm	when	they	reported	FY	2014	Unadjusted	EBITDA	of	$54.5mm.
Basically,	management	raised	EBITDA	guidance	a	mere	7	weeks	before	the	end	of	the

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 6/10


fiscal	year,	and	then	proceeded	to	miss	that	revised	number	by	over	16%!	Does	this
sound	like	a	management	team	that	has	a	firm	understanding	of	its	business	and	financial
performance?	I	don't	think	so.


Further	weakening	management's	already	low	credibility	is	their	recent	comments
regarding	the	poor	performance	of	the	business.	As	an	explanation	for	the	Company's
decrease	in	sales	in	FY	2014,	management	stated	the	following	during	VOXX's	Q4	2014
earnings	call:


"As	far	as	I	am	concerned	and	I	had	indicated	in	the	opening,	the	miss	on	our	top
line	was	solely	driven	by	the	weakness	at	retail	caused	by	the	weather."


During	their	Q1	2015	earnings	call,	management	reiterated	their	guidance	for	FY	2015,
and	again	attributed	the	weak	performance	of	the	business	to	harsh	weather	conditions:


"Our	first	quarter	results	came	in	as	expected	with	sales	down	versus	last	year's	first
quarter	but	generally	tracking	to	plan.	Fiscal	'15	began	pretty	much	where	fiscal	'14
left	off	with	March	weather	conditions	continuing	the	pattern	they	set	in	our	fourth
quarter	and	impacting	on	our	retail	business."


During	the	Company's	investor	presentation	on	September	23rd,	management
commented	that	business	performance	remained	sluggish.	However,	this	time,
management	changed	their	explanation	for	why	business	was	slow.	Obviously,
management	could	not	blame	the	winter	weather	for	sluggish	summer	retail	sales,	so
instead,	the	Company	attributed	the	poor	performance	to	a	weak	overall	retail
environment.	This	once	again	illustrates	management's	inability	to	properly	understand	the
underlying	trends	in	the	business.	Thus,	it	is	difficult	to	have	any	confidence	in
management's	ability	to	provide	accurate	forecasts.


Deteriorating	Business	Fundamentals	Another	Cause	For	Concern


In	addition	to	management	concerns,	VOXX's	business	fundamentals	have	come	under
pressure	over	the	past	year.	As	I	just	discussed,	management	reported	FY	2014	results
that	were	below	expectations.	The	Company	reported	total	sales	of	$810mm	(~2%	below
guidance	of	$825mm-$830mm)	and	Unadjusted	EBITDA	of	$54.5mm	(~16%	below
guidance	of	$65mm).	Management	stated	that	the	primary	reason	for	the	miss	was	harsh
winter	weather	that	negatively	affected	the	retail	business.	However,	management
recently	shifted	gears	from	these	comments	during	their	September	23rd	investor
presentation.	Instead	of	blaming	the	weather,	management	blamed	continuing	softness	in

the	business	on	a	poor	retail	environment	in	general.	Basically,	management	now	wants
investors	to	believe	that	the	retail	market	has	been	very	challenging	for	electronics
manufacturers	as	a	whole.	However,	this	appears	to	also	be	a	misguided	statement	when
competitors	like	Harman	International	(NYSE:HAR)	and	Universal	Electronics
(NASDAQ:UEIC)	have	continued	to	grow	their	topline	and	profits	at	a	healthy	clip.


So	what	exactly	is	going	on	at	VOXX?	Why	is	it	having	such	a	difficult	time?	My	sense	is
that	there	are	two	things	working	against	the	Company.	First,	VOXX	is	feeling	the	effects
of	intense	competitive	pressure.	As	I	mentioned,	competitors	like	HAR	and	UEIC	are
growing	sales	at	a	healthy	clip.	Beats	Electronics,	another	VOXX	competitor,	continues	to
dominate	the	headphone	market	with	an	almost	65%	market	share.	All	of	this	suggests
that	VOXX	may	be	losing	market	share	to	its	competitors.	In	addition	to	losing	market
share,	the	Company	is	also	suffering	from	fundamental	shifts	in	the	market.	A	significant
portion	of	the	decline	in	VOXX's	FY	2014	sales	was	due	to	a	decline	in	its	aftermarket
satellite	radio	sales.	The	reason	for	the	decline	is	due	to	an	increasing	proportion	of
vehicles	coming	pre-equipped	with	satellite	radio.	Another	trend	that	is	working	against	the
Company	is	the	decline	in	popularity	of	traditional	5.1	surround	sound	speakers.	In	an
attempt	to	jump-start	sales	growth,	the	Company	has	recently	focused	its	efforts	on
growing	segments	like	sound	bars	and	Bluetooth	speakers.	Unfortunately,	sales	from
these	new	products	have	not	been	enough	to	offset	the	decline	in	the	Company's	more
established	product	lines.	This	weakness	in	some	of	VOXX's	traditional	product	lines,	like
satellite	radio	and	5.1	surround	sound	speakers,	will	likely	persist	for	the	foreseeable
future.	These	negative	trends,	combined	with	continued	intense	competitive	pressure,	will
make	it	challenging	for	VOXX	to	meaningfully	grow	its	topline	and	profits	over	the	next
couple	years.


A	Few	Words	on	the	360Fly	Camera


I	suspect	that	some	VOXX	shareholders	invested	in	the	Company	in	anticipation	of	the
launch	of	the	360Fly.	I	believe	the	360Fly	camera	is	not	a	strong	enough	reason	to	hold
onto	VOXX	shares,	given	all	of	the	negatives	I	have	outlined	in	this	article.	Many
questions	remain	about	the	360Fly	camera's	ability	to	gain	mass	market	acceptance	and
take	share	from	the	juggernaut	that	is	GoPro.	Leading	consumer	electronic	players	like
Sony	have	recently	released	their	own	action	cameras	that	are	of	comparable	quality	to
GoPro,	but	have	had	little	success.	Thus,	due	to	the	challenges	VOXX	will	face	in	trying	to
disrupt	a	dominant	industry	player	like	GoPro,	I	believe	investors	should	view	360Fly	as	a
"lottery	ticket"	product	with	a	high	chance	of	failure.	Also,	the	continued	delays	in	the
launch	of	the	360Fly	have	certainly	hurt	the	product's	chances	of	success	to	some	degree.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 8/10


Another	way	to	put	the	value	of	the	360Fly	opportunity	in	proper	perspective	is	to	analyze
VOXX's	recent	investment	in	EyeSee360	(the	developer	of	360Fly).	In	April	2014,	VOXX
invested	$3mm	in	EyeSee360,	in	exchange	for	10%	of	EyeSee360's	equity.	This	mean
that	just	five	months	ago,	EyeSee360	was	valued	at	a	mere	$30mm.	What	this	low
valuation	tells	an	investor	is	that	EyeSee360	and	its	360Fly	product	is	far	from	a	sure
thing.	There	is	considerable	risk	of	failure	for	this	product,	and	the	low	valuation	that
EyeSee360	received	from	VOXX	is	a	reflection	of	that.


VOXX	Is	Overvalued	At	The	Current	Share	Price	Level


VOXX	represents	an	attractive	opportunity	for	a	short	investor.	Although	VOXX	shares
have	declined	over	45%	from	the	52-week	high	of	$18.00,	I	believe	the	Company	is	still
significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price	of	$9.37.	As	I	have	outlined	above,	the
questionable	actions	by	management	over	the	past	year	is	reason	enough	for	shares	to
decline	substantially	from	this	level.	If	you	cannot	trust	management,	there	is	simply	no
reason	to	own	shares.	In	addition	to	this,	the	business	continues	to	deteriorate	from	a
fundamental	standpoint,	with	no	indications	of	a	turnaround.	During	the	last	three	minutes
of	the	Company's	September	23rd	Investor	Presentation,	CEO	Pat	Lavelle	stated:


"...	Retail	sales	in	the	first	quarter	were	very	very	soft.	We	see	that	continuing	in	the
United	States.	Not	as	soft	as	it	was,	but	the	economy,	the	consumer	demand	has	not
rebounded	to	the	level	we	had	thought.	So,	we're	still	seeing	in	the	second	quarter	a
tepid	environment	as	far	as	retail.	And	then	when	we	look	at	the	delay	in	some	of	the
launch	of	the	products,	we'll	see	what	happens	as	the	end	of	the	quarter.	We'll	be
reporting	our	second	quarter	results	in	the	second	week	of	October,	so	I'm	kind	of
constrained	about	what	I	can	say	right	now	about	our	results.	But	when	we	do	report
I	will	offer	further	comments	on	the	outlook	of	the	Company.	The	retail	environment
as	I	said	remains	challenged	and	the	impact	that	we	would	have	of	a	delayed	launch
will	certainly	have	some	near-term	effect	on	us..."


Based	on	these	comments,	I	believe	management	will	likely	revise	FY	2015	guidance
downward	during	their	upcoming	Q2	2015	earnings	report.	I	have	outlined	below	my	FY
2015	projections	for	VOXX,	assuming	two	different	guidance	revision	scenarios:

In	my	base	case,	I	assume	that	management	lowers	FY	2015	topline	guidance	from	the
prior	target	of	~2%	annual	sales	growth	($825mm-$830mm	total	sales)	to	0%	growth.	I
have	also	assumed	that	management	maintains	their	current	gross	margin	target	of	29%
and	operating	expense	annual	growth	target	of	4%-5%.	As	per	management	comments
provided	during	the	Q1	2015	earnings	call,	I	assume	a	37%	tax	rate.


In	my	downside	case,	I	assume	that	management	lowers	FY	2015	topline	guidance	by	a
more	significant	amount,	from	the	prior	target	of	~2%	annual	sales	growth	to	an	annual
decrease	in	total	sales	of	3%.	I	believe	a	3%	decline	in	sales	for	the	downside	case	is
reasonable	because	it	is	in	line	with	the	Company's	3%	decline	in	total	sales	in	FY	2014.
Once	again,	I	have	assumed	that	management	maintains	their	current	gross	margin	target
of	29%,	operating	expense	annual	growth	target	of	4%-5%	and	a	37%	tax	rate.


On	average,	comparable	companies	such	as	Universal	Electronics,	Harman	International
and	DTS	Inc.	(NASDAQ:DTSI)	trade	at	a	P/E	multiple	of	~20x.	I	believe	VOXX	deserves	a
P/E	valuation	multiple	that	is	discounted	25%-50%	from	industry	comparables,	due	to	the
management	issues	and	deteriorations	in	the	business	I	have	outlined	in	this	article.	Thus,
I	believe	that	a	FY	2015	P/E	multiple	of	10x-15x	is	fair	for	VOXX.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2548805-voxx-international-strong-sell-due-to-questionable-management-practices-and-deteriorating-fundamentals 10/10


In	my	base	case	scenario,	applying	a	10x-15x	P/E	multiple	to	FY	2015	fully	diluted	EPS	of
$0.43	results	in	an	implied	share	price	valuation	of	$4.30-$6.45	per	share.	This	represents
a	54%-31%	discount	to	the	current	share	price	of	$9.37.	In	my	downside	case	scenario,
applying	a	10x-15x	P/E	multiple	to	FY	2015	fully	diluted	EPS	of	$0.25	results	in	an	implied
share	price	valuation	of	$2.49-$3.74	per	share.	This	represents	a	73%-60%	discount	to
the	current	share	price	of	$9.37.	Thus,	VOXX	shares	at	the	current	price	appear	to	be
overvalued	by	at	least	30%,	and	as	much	as	70%	on	a	fundamental	basis.	If	you	add	in	a
discount	for	the	loss	of	investor	trust	in	VOXX's	management	team,	VOXX	shares	have
the	potential	to	fall	much	further	from	the	current	price	level.


My	Conversation	With	Investor	Relations


It	should	be	noted	that	I	recently	spoke	with	Investor	Relations	about	their	FY	2015
guidance.	Unfortunately,	they	were	not	able	to	provide	a	clear	explanation	as	to	how
management	came	up	with	their	seemingly	inflated	EBITDA	and	FCF	targets.


Conclusion


Given	the	questionable	actions	by	management	over	the	past	year	and	continuing
deterioration	in	VOXX's	business,	I	believe	VOXX	shares	are	significantly	overvalued	at
the	current	price	of	$9.37.	Thus,	I	would	recommend	initiating	a	short	position	in	VOXX,	or
selling	shares	if	you	are	a	current	VOXX	shareholder.
