American Addiction Centers: Grand Jury Testimony Creates Doubts
About AAC's Defense

Summary


Grand jury testimony shows that the chief coroner believes that the patient would not
have died if he had constant access to oxygen.


This undermines AAC's claim that the patient died of natural causes as the primary
defense from the company.


Testimony from Jose Ochoa also tells the story of Jerrod Menz fleeing from the
Irongate facility - where the patient died - with a garbage bag filled with prescriptions
"house meds".


AAC Holding's (NASDAQ:AAC) main defense since the news that Jerrod Menz and
serveral others as well as the Forterus subsidiary were indicted on second degree murder
has been that the coroner's report stated that the patient died of natural causes. New
evidence from the Grand Jury has surfaced however that reveals that this defense is
questionable as the lead coroner believes that the patient would still be alive if he
had access to supplemental oxygen. Further testimony describes eyewitness accounts
of Jerrod Menz fleeing the scene of the crime with a garbage bag full of "house meds."


AAC's Defense


From the first day that the news broke, AAC's main defense has been that the coroner
ruled that the patient had died of natural causes.


On the second quarter conference call:


"We firmly believe that the California Department of Justice case is without merit. We
will vigorously defend the company and each individual in court. The case involves
the death in 2010 of a client who was found dead of natural causes in his room
the morning after he checked into one of our facilities."


And later on that same conference call:

"We are not currently aware of any evidence that the company or any of these
individuals charged were responsible for the resident's death. The coroner
concluded the client died of hypertension cardiovascular disease. The
individual also had a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
according to a police report. The coroner made absolutely no findings that the
death had anything to do with his treatment at our facility."


However, the Chief Coroner believes that the patient died from a lack of oxygen, not
from natural causes.


In testimony from the Grand Jury, however, Riverside County Chief Coroner Dr. Joseph
Cohen suggested otherwise. Dr. Fajardo did the first autopsy and concluded that the
patient had died of natural causes. However, the Chief Coroner of Riverside County has a
policy where in the case of an unattended death and there were pre-existing medical
conditions, that an effort to find out whether or not the pre-existing medical conditions
played into the death. However, in the case of the patient's death, Dr. Cohen concluded
that Dr. Fajardo had not investigated the patient's previous medical condition. In his sworn
testimony, Dr. Cohen stated that he believed if Dr. Fajardo had investigated the oxygen
issues, the medical records, and the drug issues that he would have found that the patient
died of a lack of oxygen.


In one powerful exchange, Dr. Cohen states that the patient would still be alive if he had a
constant flow of supplemental oxygen.

on page 1304.


Jerrod Menz Fleeing the Crime Scene


In the last article on AAC, the issue of the "house supply" of drugs was raised. At the time,
Forterus and AAC would have a supply of drugs that had not been prescribed to the
patients, but were used to detox patients before they had seen a doctor. AAC has never
addressed these allegations.

Jose Ochoa's grand jury testimony tells the story of Jerrod Menz fleeing the crime scene
after the patient's death with a garbage bag filled with prescription medicine.


According to testimony from Janelle Ito-Orille, who works for the California Department of
Health Care Services, and now works there as a supervisor. In her testimony, she says
that the drugs that Jerrod Menz was driving away from the facility with, should
never have even been there in the first place.


You can view the full excerpt of her testimony here.


Jose Ochoa was a senior counselor at A Better Tomorrow [Forterus] at the time when the
patient died. In his court testimony, he describes shocking scenes of Jerrod Menz fleeing
the scene of the crime with a garbage bag that was filled with approximately 5 pounds of
prescription medication. Again, it is worth noting that this is not some disgruntled former
employee, but testimony in a court under oath. You can view the entirety of the exchange
here.
