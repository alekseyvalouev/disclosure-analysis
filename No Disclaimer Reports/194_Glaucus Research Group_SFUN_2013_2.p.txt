Olam’s	
  180-­Degree	
  Reversal	
  on	
  Tapping	
  the	
  Markets	
  Validates	
  MW’s	
  Thesis,	
  


and	
  Raises	
  More	
  Concerns	
  
	
  


• Olam’s	
  surprise	
  announcement	
  of	
  an	
  unusually	
  structured	
  US$750	
  million	
  
debt	
  issuance	
  validates	
  our	
  thesis	
  that	
  Olam	
  is	
  in	
  danger	
  of	
  failing.	
  	
  Only	
  in	
  
the	
  case	
  of	
  our	
  November	
  2010	
  report	
  on	
  Rino	
  International	
  have	
  we	
  had	
  a	
  
faster	
  confirmation	
  of	
  an	
  investment	
  thesis.	
  	
  	
  
	
  
The	
  announcement	
  also	
  intrigues	
  us	
  with	
  the	
  possibility	
  that	
  Olam	
  could	
  
have	
  been	
  only	
  days	
  away	
  from	
  collapsing.	
  	
  Our	
  view	
  remains	
  Strong	
  Sell.	
  	
  
Olam	
  CEO	
  Sunny	
  Verghese	
  has	
  accused	
  us	
  of	
  shouting	
  “Fire!”	
  in	
  a	
  crowded	
  
theater.	
  	
  Mr.	
  Verghese:	
  The	
  fire	
  department	
  is	
  now	
  here	
  and	
  is	
  pulling	
  
survivors	
  out	
  of	
  the	
  burning	
  building.	
  	
  	
  
	
  


• We	
  are	
  intrigued	
  by	
  the	
  possibility	
  that	
  Olam	
  could	
  have	
  been	
  only	
  days	
  
away	
  from	
  collapsing.	
  	
  We	
  theorize	
  that	
  Olam’s	
  banks	
  told	
  Temasek	
  they	
  
would	
  turn	
  off	
  the	
  taps	
  unless	
  Temasek	
  provided	
  additional	
  financing	
  to	
  the	
  
Company.	
  	
  (If	
  the	
  banks	
  were	
  to	
  stop	
  lending	
  to	
  Olam,	
  it	
  would	
  almost	
  
certainly	
  collapse.)	
  	
  According	
  to	
  Mr.	
  Verghese	
  himself,	
  the	
  origin	
  of	
  this	
  
transaction	
  was	
  that	
  Olam’s	
  banks	
  approached	
  Temasek,	
  which	
  then	
  notified	
  
Olam	
  of	
  the	
  proposal.	
  	
  (In	
  our	
  report,	
  we	
  theorized	
  that	
  Olam’s	
  banks	
  could	
  
have	
  become	
  reluctant	
  to	
  lend	
  it	
  more	
  money.)	
  	
  	
  
	
  
If	
  we	
  are	
  correct,	
  this	
  financing	
  is	
  anything	
  but	
  an	
  expression	
  of	
  confidence.	
  	
  
It	
  would	
  not	
  be	
  a	
  good	
  sign	
  if	
  your	
  banks	
  ask	
  your	
  shareholders	
  to	
  lend	
  you	
  
more	
  money.	
  	
  It	
  seems	
  that	
  even	
  the	
  banks,	
  which	
  are	
  secured	
  lenders,	
  might	
  
have	
  started	
  to	
  subscribe	
  to	
  Muddy	
  Waters’s	
  thesis.	
  	
  
	
  
Only	
  four	
  days	
  ago,	
  Mr.	
  Verghese	
  vehemently	
  insisted	
  that	
  it	
  would	
  not	
  tap	
  
the	
  markets	
  for	
  at	
  least	
  five	
  months.	
  	
  This	
  180-­‐degree	
  reversal	
  supports	
  our	
  
thesis	
  that	
  the	
  Company	
  was	
  in	
  dire	
  straits	
  over	
  the	
  weekend.	
  	
  (This	
  reversal	
  
supports	
  another	
  point	
  we	
  have	
  made	
  about	
  Olam	
  –	
  its	
  management	
  should	
  
be	
  given	
  no	
  credibility.	
  	
  Its	
  predictions	
  of	
  high	
  returns	
  from	
  its	
  CapEx	
  binge	
  
are	
  likely	
  to	
  turn	
  out	
  to	
  be	
  as	
  inaccurate	
  as	
  its	
  five	
  month	
  prediction.)	
  
	
  
Olam’s	
  effective	
  cost	
  of	
  this	
  debt	
  is	
  likely	
  over	
  10%,	
  which	
  should	
  indicate	
  
that	
  this	
  raise	
  was	
  not	
  a	
  luxury	
  for	
  Olam.	
  	
  The	
  yield	
  without	
  the	
  warrant	
  is	
  
8.08%,	
  and	
  with	
  the	
  cost	
  of	
  the	
  warrant,	
  the	
  effective	
  cost	
  to	
  Olam	
  is	
  likely	
  in	
  
excess	
  of	
  10%.	
  	
  The	
  proceeds	
  from	
  this	
  issuance	
  are	
  not	
  intended	
  for	
  CapEx.	
  	
  
The	
  Company	
  has	
  stated	
  that	
  the	
  funds	
  raised	
  will	
  be	
  for	
  working	
  capital	
  and	
  
to	
  repay	
  existing	
  debt.	
  	
  Its	
  existing	
  debt	
  is	
  presumably	
  much	
  less	
  expensive	
  
than	
  this	
  new	
  debt.

• The	
  US$750	
  million	
  that	
  Olam	
  is	
  raising	
  merely	
  postpones	
  the	
  collapse	
  that	
  
we	
  feel	
  is	
  almost	
  inevitable.1	
  	
  Given	
  that	
  our	
  model	
  forecasted	
  Olam	
  would	
  
have	
  to	
  raise	
  or	
  refinance	
  up	
  to	
  S$4.6	
  billion	
  in	
  the	
  next	
  12	
  months	
  to	
  stay	
  
afloat,	
  this	
  raise	
  is	
  likely	
  only	
  a	
  portion	
  of	
  what	
  it	
  needs	
  make	
  it	
  one	
  more	
  
year.	
  	
  	
  
	
  
Regardless,	
  Olam’s	
  fundamental	
  problem	
  remains	
  unchanged:	
  The	
  Company	
  
has	
  borrowed	
  substantial	
  amounts	
  of	
  money	
  to	
  fund	
  capital	
  projects	
  that	
  we	
  
believe	
  are	
  incapable	
  of	
  repaying	
  the	
  debt.	
  	
  We	
  think	
  this	
  raise	
  looks	
  a	
  lot	
  like	
  
Hank	
  Paulson’s	
  “bazooka”,	
  which	
  only	
  bought	
  Fannie	
  Mae	
  and	
  Freddie	
  Mac	
  a	
  
few	
  months	
  before	
  they	
  collapsed.	
  	
  Thus,	
  we	
  maintain	
  our	
  view	
  on	
  Olam.	
  


	
  
• Is	
  it	
  really	
  fair	
  to	
  ask	
  retail	
  investors	
  to	
  increase	
  their	
  exposure	
  to	
  Olam	
  while	
  


Olam	
  is	
  refusing	
  to	
  obtain	
  a	
  bond	
  rating?	
  	
  Olam	
  has	
  stated	
  that	
  it	
  will	
  not	
  
accept	
  our	
  offer	
  to	
  pay	
  Standard	
  &	
  Poor’s	
  to	
  rate	
  one	
  of	
  its	
  bond	
  issues.	
  	
  A	
  
debt	
  rating	
  would	
  be	
  an	
  important	
  step	
  toward	
  transparency	
  –	
  particularly	
  
given	
  Olam’s	
  substantial	
  retail	
  investor	
  base.	
  	
  	
  


	
  
While	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  is	
  a	
  business,	
  one	
  of	
  our	
  primary	
  motivations	
  is	
  to	
  try	
  to	
  
level	
  the	
  playing	
  field	
  between	
  managements	
  (and	
  their	
  lawyers,	
  consultants,	
  
investor	
  relations	
  firms,	
  and	
  auditors)	
  on	
  one	
  hand,	
  and	
  investors	
  on	
  the	
  
other.	
  	
  It	
  is	
  seldom	
  a	
  fair	
  game	
  for	
  retail	
  investors,	
  and	
  we	
  think	
  that	
  Olam’s	
  
attempt	
  to	
  foist	
  more	
  unrated	
  debt	
  upon	
  retail	
  investors	
  is	
  just	
  another	
  
example	
  of	
  the	
  sickness	
  that	
  ails	
  today’s	
  capital	
  markets.	
  


	
  
• In	
  other	
  Muddy	
  Waters	
  news,	
  the	
  Ontario	
  Securities	
  Commission	
  has	
  charged	
  


Ernst	
  &	
  Young	
  with	
  securities	
  violations	
  for	
  allegedly	
  not	
  performing	
  its	
  
audits	
  on	
  Sino-­‐Forest	
  with	
  proper	
  diligence.	
  	
  E&Y	
  also	
  agreed	
  to	
  pay	
  
US$117.6	
  to	
  settle	
  class	
  action	
  claims	
  resulting	
  from	
  its	
  audits	
  of	
  Sino-­‐Forest.	
  	
  
Separately,	
  the	
  United	
  States	
  Securities	
  and	
  Exchange	
  Commission	
  has	
  also	
  
announced	
  that	
  it	
  is	
  suing	
  the	
  PRC	
  affiliates	
  of	
  E&Y,	
  KPMG,	
  BDO,	
  PwC,	
  and	
  
Deloitte	
  for	
  failing	
  to	
  comply	
  with	
  requests	
  for	
  their	
  audit	
  papers	
  of	
  various	
  
US-­‐listed

1 If Olam were to raise at least S$3 billion of equity, we would reconsider our view.
