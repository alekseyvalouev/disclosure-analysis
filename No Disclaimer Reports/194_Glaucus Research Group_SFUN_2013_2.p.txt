IT IS SO FUN TO CONCEAL RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS (NYSE: SFUN)


On April 4, 2013, we released our initial report on SouFun Holdings Limited (“SouFun” or the “Company”), available here.  In this follow-up 
report, we present smoking-gun evidence which, we believe, shows that SouFun Chairman Vincent Tianquan Mo (“Chairman Mo”) orchestrated a 
series of undisclosed related party transactions to siphon $14 million out of SouFun, and in the process violated US and Hong Kong securities laws.
Such concealed related party acquisitions are similar to the nefarious behavior we discovered at China Medical, which collapsed spectacularly after 
we alerted investors to malfeasance by its management team. 


I. Mo’s Money; Your Problem.  In 2012, SouFun purchased 47 hotel rooms in Sanya on Hainan Island for $14 million.  SouFun 
told investors that it bought the property from an “independent third party.” The evidence shows that this was not true.


a. Concealed Related Party Transactions.  SAIC filings show that SouFun purchased the hotel rooms from a special purpose 
vehicle (“Sanya Property SPV”), an entity which Chairman Mo and SouFun CEO Richard Jiangong Dai (“Richard Dai”)
owned and controlled only three months before the sale of the Sanya property to SouFun.   It appears that there was a 
deliberate attempt to hide the relationship between Chairman Mo, CEO Richard Dai and the Sanya Property SPV by 
changing the entity’s name only one month before the Sanya property sale.  


b. SouFun Likely Fronted the Money.  SouFun mysteriously loaned $15 million to a holding company controlled by Deng 
Wei, a university classmate of Chairman Mo, right before he purchased the Sanya Property SPV from Chairman Mo and 
Richard Dai.  This money was suspiciously repaid only three weeks after SouFun paid $13 million to the Sanya Property 
SPV in exchange for the hotel rooms.  The use of loans from SouFun to Deng Wei made it even more difficult for investors 
and regulators to decipher that Chairman Mo and Richard Dai were the ultimate beneficiaries of the Sanya property 
transaction.   See our explanatory video here.   


c. Deng Wei’s Reward? We believe that Chairman Mo rewarded Deng Wei for being the front man in the Sanya transaction 
by giving him a generous independent directorship at Shun Cheong Holdings (HK: 0650) (“Shun Cheong”) a Hong Kong-
listed company controlled by the Chairman and his wife.   We believe that in the process, Chairman Mo violated Hong Kong 
securities laws by claiming that Deng Wei was an ‘independent director’, when in reality, he had borrowed money from 
SouFun and appears to have served as a conduit to siphon the proceeds of the Sanya property purchase to Chairman Mo and 
Richard Dai.  


II. Missing Charitable Donations.  In 2011, SouFun paid over $2 million to Wall Street Global Training Center (“WSGTC”), a 
New York not-for-profit under the control of Chairman Mo.  The cash was mostly a prepayment for training courses to be held in 
2012 for 305 SouFun employees at 72 Wall St.  However, publicly available IRS records demonstrate unequivocally that 
WSGTC received less than $50,000 in 2011.  Further, SouFun admitted in its response to our initial report that 72 Wall St. was 
not fit for use and conversations with the doormen suggest large-scale training courses were never held at the building.  In our 
view, the most likely explanation is that the Chairman misappropriated the funds.


We believe that not only did SouFun make false statements in its SEC filings by characterizing the seller of the Sanya properties as an “independent 
third party,” but that an acquisition from a business secretly owned/controlled by the Chairman and CEO only three months before the buyout (and 
paid for with cash possibly fronted by the Company) is a textbook securities violation.  In our opinion, such premeditated and explicit lies should 
lead US and HK regulators and the NYSE to immediately launch a formal inquiry and suspend trading of SouFun’s shares pending a full 
investigation.

I. Mo’s Money; Your Problem


On March 15, 2012, SouFun purchased 44 hotel rooms at the Sanya Bay La Costa Hotel in Hainan 
(http://www.sanyalacostahotel.com) for $13 million,


1
ostensibly to serve as a corporate office and for 


“internal training.” In our original report, we expressed skepticism as to why an Internet Company would 


need 44 hotel rooms at a 5-star resort in one of China’s most popular vacation destinations.  The price of 
the acquisition was also highly suspicious: for $13 million, SouFun could have bought (at current prices) 
113,322 nights at the hotel.


2


We believe that we have solved the mystery.  The transaction appears designed to allow Chairman Mo 


and his nephew, CEO Richard Dai, to siphon money out of the Company without disclosing it to 
shareholders.  


1) Concealed Related Party Transactions


SouFun’s 2011 20-F stated that the Company purchased the Sanya property from “Beijing 


Hengxinjiahua Investment Consultancy Limited, an independent third-party” (“Sanya Property 
SPV”).  This could not be further from the truth. 


SAIC files show that SouFun’s Chairman Mo established the Sanya Property SPV in 2009, which at the 
time he called Beijing Dongfangximei Investment Consultancy.  We have included an excerpt of the 
SAIC files below showing that Chairman Mo formed the Sanya Property SPV and served as the entity’s 


controlling shareholder with 80% of its shares.  SouFun CEO Richard Dai owned the remaining 20% of 
its shares.

All amounts in this report are quoted in US dollars unless stated otherwise.

In June 2012, the Company purchased three more hotel rooms for  ~$900,000 (aggregate) from the same entity, 


bringing the total number of rooms purchased from the Sanya Property SPV to 47, for a total consideration of $14 


million.  See 2012 20-F, page 39.

If investors or regulators need any further proof, a SouFun employee and presumably an 


administrative assistant to Chairman Mo listed her SouFun email address as the contact address 


for the Sanya Property SPV: zhangshuang@soufun.com (see excerpt of SAIC filing below).
www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


4


In December 2011, three months before SouFun purchased the Sanya property, SAIC filings show that
Chairman Mo and SouFun’s CEO Richard Dai transferred all of their shares in the Sanya Property SPV to 


Dandong Yuanlong Villa Management Company (“Villa Management”), an entity under the control of 
Deng Wei. According to this article on SouFun’s website, Deng Wei is Chairman Mo’s friend from their
time together at Tsinghua University.


Below is the share transfer agreement, dated December 19, 2011, with Chairman Mo’s signature.  This 
excerpt shows the share transfer to Villa Management.

http://www.soufun.com/news/2007-12-26/1421484.htm
www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


5


SAIC filings show that upon the sale by Chairman Mo and Richard Dai of the Sanya Property SPV to 
Villa Management, Deng Wei became its registered representative.  


In February 2012, one month after Chairman Mo transferred his shares in the Sanya Property SPV 


to Deng Wei’s Villa Management and one month before SouFun bought the Sanya property, the 


Sanya Property SPV changed its name to Beijing Hengxinjiahua:
www.glaucusresearch.comSOUFUN HOLDINGS LIMITED | NYSE: SFUN


6


We believe that the conspirators changed the name of the Sanya Property SPV from Beijing Dongfang to 


Beijing Hengxinjiahua one month before the sale to SouFun because SouFun had already mentioned in its 


2011 20-F that Beijing Dongfang (spelled Dong Fang in the SEC filings) was a related party under the 


control of the Chairman. 


The fact that the name change occurred only one month before the sale of the Sanya property to SouFun 


strongly suggests that this was a premeditated deception. Chairman Mo would have surmised, correctly, 


that SouFun’s shareholders would be up in arms if SouFun bought 47 hotel rooms in a vacation resort 


from an entity recently under his control without any disclosure on the matter. It appears as though 


Chairman Mo and CEO Richard Dai were just trying to cover their tracks so that no one would recognize 


the name of the seller when SouFun announced the purchase.


In March 2012, SouFun purchased the Sanya properties from the Sanya Property SPV, telling 


shareholders that it was buying the hotel rooms from an “independent third party” and that it planned to 


use the properties as “our local office in Hainan as well as for internal training purposes.” 


Yet SouFun never disclosed to investors that its Chairman and its CEO founded, owned and controlled 


the Sanya Property SPV, or that both men only transferred their shareholdings to Villa Management, an 


entity under the control Chairman Mo’s university buddy, three months before the Company bought the 


Sanya property. 


We believe that the sole purpose of transferring shares to Villa Management and changing the name of 


the entity of the Sanya Property SPV was to conceal Chairman Mo and Richard Dai’s prior ownership 


and control of the Sanya properties.  Such premeditated and deliberate deceptions are, in our opinion, far 


more sinister than simply an undisclosed related party transaction. 


2) SouFun May Have Fronted the Money for Villa Management’s Purchase


The rabbit hole goes even deeper.  SouFun mysteriously loaned $15 million to Villa Management in Q4


2011, right around the time that Villa Management took ownership of the Sanya Property SPV from 
Chairman Mo and CEO Richard Dai.  The loan was repaid three weeks after SouFun bought the Sanya 


properties from Villa Management. 


SouFun’s 2011 20-F contains the following statement:


As of December 31, 2011, loans receivable represent the loans of US$11,109 and US$15,034 to Beijing 


Pujin and Dandong Yuanlong Villa Management Company [(“Villa Management”)], respectively. 


The loan to [Villa Management] has a term of six months with an interest rate of 10% per annum. [Villa 


Management] is an independent third party. The loan to [Villa Management] was guaranteed by a 


major shareholder of [Villa Management], and was subsequently collected in full on April 6, 2012.


Put simply, SouFun appears to have loaned the amount of the purchase price to Villa Management in 
late 2011, allowing Villa Management to pay Chairman Mo and CEO Richard Dai for the Sanya Property 


SPV in December 2011.  Then, three months later, Villa Management used the Sanya Property SPV to 
sell the Sanya properties to SouFun for $14 million, and its $15 million debt to SouFun was repaid shortly 
thereafter.

We have included the following flow chart to serve as a visual aid in explaining what we believe were 
deliberately complicated machinations. 


It appears to us that SouFun fronted the money to Deng Wei to allow him to purchase the hotel rooms 
from Chairman Mo and CEO Richard Dai, further supporting our theses that SouFun’s purchase of the 


Sanya property was not an arm’s length transaction and that the SouFun brain trust deliberately concealed 
its Chairman and CEO’s involvement in the transaction.  Below is a screenshot of a brief video we 
created to explain the transaction (click on the screenshot to go to the video).

3) Deng Wei’s Reward?


The clever investor may ask: what did Deng Wei get out of the deal? 


On March 23, 2011, eight days after SouFun bought the Sanya property from the Sanya Property SPV,


Chairman Mo appointed Deng Wei to be an independent director of Shun Cheong (HKEX: 0650), a 


public company on the Hong Kong exchange in which Chairman Mo and his wife hold a majority stake.  


Deng Wei’s independent directorship entitled him to an annual salary of HK$100,000.  


We believe the evidence supports a simple narrative: Deng Wei’s appointment, and his HK$100,000 per 


year salary, was a ‘quid pro quo’ for his help in concealing Chairman Mo’s ownership in the Sanya 


properties.  


Even more egregious, in the filing to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and Shun Cheong’s shareholders 


announcing Deng Wei's appointment to the board of directors, Shun Cheong stated that “Mr. Deng does 


not have any relationship with any directors, senior management, substantial shareholders or 


controlling shareholder of the Company and does not have any interest in the shares of the Company 


within the meaning of Part XV of the Securities and Futures Ordinance as at the date of this 


announcement.”  We believe this statement was a lie.  


Under Rule 3.13 of the HKEX Listing Rules, Deng Wei would not be considered an independent director 


if he had “a material interest in any principal business activity of or is involved in any material business 


dealings with the listed issuer, its holding company or their respective subsidiaries or with any 


connected persons of the listed issuer…”  


Deng Wei clearly was involved in “material business dealings” with SouFun’s Chairman Mo, a 


connected person under Hong Kong rules.  Deng Wei’s Villa Management obtained a loan from SouFun 


four months prior to his appointment (a loan which was still outstanding at the time of his 


appointment as a supposedly independent director); Deng Wei bought the Sanya Property SPV from 


Chairman Mo three months prior to his appointment; and Deng Wei sold the Sanya hotel rooms to 


SouFun eight days prior to his appointment.


As if to underscore that Deng Wei is not an independent director, his company, Villa Management, sold


three more hotel rooms for ~$900,000 through the Sanya Property SPV to SouFun in June 2012, 


which was over two months after he accepted his position as an ‘independent’ director.  This is a clear 


violation of Hong Kong securities laws.  


We suspect that the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will suspend trading of Shun Cheong’s shares pending a 


full inquiry into the matter, which we are confident will reveal that Shun Cheong violated Hong Kong 


securities laws by holding Deng Wei out as an independent director when he was not, in fact, 


independent.

II. Missing Charitable Donations


On April 5, 2013, SouFun issued a press release responding to our initial report yet failed to address our
report’s most troubling evidence.  In 2011, SouFun claimed to have paid over $2 million to Wall Street 
Global Training Center (“WSGTC”), a New York not-for-profit under the control of Chairman Mo. The 


payment of $500,000 was ostensibly for training programs conducted at 72 Wall St. in 2011.  The 
payment of $1.6 million was purportedly a prepayment for training programs to be conducted in 2012.  
However, publicly available IRS records show unequivocally that WSGTC received less than $50,000 in 


2011. In our view, the likely explanation is that Chairman Mo misappropriated the funds and that the 
charity never received the money.


SouFun’s response deserves to be quoted in full: 


“SouFun purchased 72 Wall Street for its long term strategy of SouFun's internal global training 
programs collectively called SouFun Business School. The facility needs renovation and is 
now not in a condition for full operations. The company has been using it as a temporary 


office and occasionally for visiting SouFun employees and clients (62 visitors in 2011, 241 
visitors in 2012, and planning for 350 visitors in 2013). It is preliminarily planned to open in 
full in two years from today.  SouFun's visiting employees and clients for training purposes 


are mostly arranged by a related party called Wall Street Global Training Center (a not for profit 
organization in application), of which our Chairman is a director. In the past two plus years, 
SouFun paid roughly $2 million (which has been disclosed with SEC) to Wall Street Global 


Training Center for the 300 plus visitors.


1) Show Me The Money


First, it appears that the money never made it to WSGTC.  It is misleading for the Company to 


insinuate that the $2 million in payments to WSGTC was spread out over “the past two plus years” 
when SouFun’s previous SEC filings show that SouFun paid $2 million to the charity in December 2011.   
The Overseas Training Agreement, signed December 20, 2011 (available here), required SouFun, “within 


seven days after signing this agreement, to pay 80% of the aggregate training fee (US$1,595,000) to 
Party B’s account.” 


The contract corroborates SouFun’s 2011 Annual Report, which states that: 


“Wall Street Global Training Center, Inc., a New York not-for-profit corporation, provided 


training services to us in 2011. Mr. Mo, Shan Li and Quan Zhou are directors of Wall Street 
Global Training Center, Inc ... In 2011, we paid Wall Street Global Training Center, Inc. 


training service fees of approximately US$0.5 million. In addition, we also prepaid service 


fees of US$1.6 million for future services.”


We believe that the evidence clearly shows that the payments from SouFun to WSGTC were not spread 


out over “two plus years.”  According to SouFun’s 2011 Annual Report (and the contract governing the 
deal between SouFun and WSGTC), they should have been received by WSGTC in December 2011.  
However, publicly available IRS records show unequivocally that WSGTC received less than $50,000 in 


2011.

WSGTC’s 2011 Tax Returns cover the period from the formation of the Company in May 2011 until April 2012.

2) 72 Wall St. To Be Ready in 2015!


The Company admitted in its press release on April 5, 2013, that the 72 Wall Street facility “needs 
renovation and is not now in a condition for full operation” and that it “is preliminarily planned to open 
in full in two years from today.” 72 Wall Street has presumably been in such condition since the 


Company bought it in September 2011.  Indeed, site visits and interviews with the doormen at 72 Wall 
Street by our consultants indicated that 20 months after the purchase, the building is still virtually empty 
and has barely been in use since SouFun purchased it. 


If the building is not in use today (and will not be ready for another two years), then why did SouFun 


pay WSGTC $1.6 million for “295 persons to attend short-term training (7 days for $6,100 each) and 
for 10 persons to attend mid-term training (2 months for $19,500 each)” in 2012?


4


In our opinion, it seems highly unlikely that the Company held week-long training sessions for 295 
people in 2012, and for 10 people for two months in a dilapidated and empty building that will not be 
ready to use until 2015 (at the earliest).  We suggest that investors and regulators should visit 72 Wall 


Street on their own and see the condition of the building. We are confident that you will form the same 
opinions and come to the same conclusions as we did.  


3) Where were the trainees?


The Company also admitted, in its press release of April 5, 2013, that the 72 Wall St. building only 


received 241 ‘visitors’ in 2012.  The response did not say that 305 employees attended training sessions 
at the Company.  Merely that 241 “employees and clients” visited the building in 2012. During our 
consultant’s site visit, the doorman stated that he had not seen groups of visitors, suggesting that teams of 


SouFun employees have not attended training sessions in the building.  


Ultimately, investors must consider that SouFun paid $2 million to a not-for-profit controlled by 
Chairman Mo in exchange for 295 one-week training sessions and 10 two-month training sessions, which 
were all supposed to occur in 2012.  Yet the money does not appear on the charity’s tax returns, 72 Wall 


St. is not fit for commercial use, and it appears that nowhere close to the number of people visited the 
building in 2012 for the Company’s statement to be true.


III. So Fun While it Lasted


In sum, this follow-up report has presented smoking-gun evidence which, we believe, shows that 


Chairman Mo and his associates (i) made materially false and misleading statements to the SEC and to 
US investors by concealing the Chairman and the CEO’s connection to the Sanya property acquired by 
the Company; (ii) made materially false and misleading statements to the Hong Kong Stock Exchange 


and Hong Kong investors in Shun Cheong by claiming that his classmate, who facilitated the apparent 
scheme to conceal the Chairman’s prior ownership of the Sanya properties bought by SouFun, was an 
independent director of a Hong Kong listed public company; and (iii) made materially false and 


misleading statements to the IRS about the receipt of $2 million in purportedly charitable donations to 
WSGTC for training sessions at 72 Wall Street that appear never to have taken place.  


We believe that such premeditated and explicit lies, materially false and misleading disclosures, and 
actions and conduct, which in our opinion, were designed to obfuscate the truth, should lead regulators 


and the NYSE to immediately suspend trading of SouFun’s shares pending a full investigation into 
the information we have presented in our original report and this follow up report.
