Summary


Editors' Pick Short Ideas Healthcare


ZYXI


We uncover strong evidence that UnitedHealthcare is removing Zynex from its
network effective February 15, a seemingly material event undisclosed to investors.


Zynex will lose its largest payor and only national commercial network if so, a
critical relationship that represented high margin revenue worth 50-100% of
EBITDA.


UHC’s aggressive decision signals major billing abuses and, if correct, a high
probability it pursues Zynex for overpayments (potential liability of ~$40m),
introducing profound downside for the stock.


Considering the damage to cash flow, profitability, and impact on 2022 earnings
which will likely fall short of consensus estimates – we believe the stock is
uninvestable.

We've long suspected Zynex (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:ZYXI) was reliant on billing
UnitedHealthcare (NYSE: UNH) for excessive quantities of electrodes. When UHC
recently introduced a new TENS coverage policy it appeared the insurer finally detected
the impropriety but might continue to pay Zynex claims if at reduced rates. However,
UHC appears to be taking decisive action to put an end to Zynex's excessive billing. See
below:

UHC patient


This letter, forwarded to us by a UHC patient concerned about Zynex's billing, clearly
indicates UHC is removing Zynex from its network effective February 15. The decision -
which Zynex has not disclosed to investors - would end a ten-year relationship with its
largest payor and only national commercial network contract.

Network Expulsion Cuts Off Zynex's Largest and Most
Important Source of Revenue


We estimate the expulsion will immediately cost Zynex nearly all its UHC business
which for several years has represented 15-25% of revenue equal to 50-100% of
EBITDA. UHC revenue was critical to Zynex as its extremely high margins offset
negative margin orders from most other public and commercial insurers. We find it hard
to see how Zynex grows from here. The more relevant debate at this point is the
degree to which Zynex shrinks.


Exhibit 2 - 2022E NMR vs Consensus


NMR


Moreover, the decision signals a high likelihood UHC pursues recovery of past
payments which total an estimated $45m to $80m since 2017. We highlighted this
risk in our last report, presenting the case of a competitor whom UHC found was using
the same billing tactics as Zynex - although far less egregiously. In that case UHC
attempted to recover nearly four years of overpaid claims and used the threat of network
removal as leverage, but never dropped the competitor from its network. That Zynex is
being dropped indicates a relatively offensive posture at UHC, and we expect the
insurer to make repayment demands.


We called Zynex customer service representatives on two occasions in late January as
patients inquiring about insurance coverage. The representatives confirmed the network
loss and noted the company was unaware of the cause.


On January 27 we asked UHC Consumer Affairs to comment on its network contract
with Zynex. The UHC representative confirmed Zynex's removal adding that it was
UHC's decision to terminate the relationship:

UnitedHealthcare Business Enabled Zynex Profitability and
Growth


NMR: Can UnitedHealthcare comment on its network agreement with Zynex
Medical?


UHC Consumer Affairs: UnitedHealthcare made the decision to opt out of the
contract. Due to confidentiality concerns, we cannot disclose more information at this
time.


The loss of network status would effectively close UHC as a significant source of
revenue. We previously estimated UHC's new TENS coverage policy could cut its
reimbursement to Zynex by 80%. With the loss of network status, the damage will be
even worse. We think remaining coverage may include a small subset of patients with
rare plans that cover out-of-network durable medical equipment and who don't mind
substantially higher out-of-pocket costs. As a result, we think Zynex's UHC revenues
will be cut by at least 90%.


The prescription TENS business is based on the razor-razorblade model: place TENS
units and collect recurring higher-margin revenue from monthly supplies. But due to
Medicare reimbursement cuts, the model is barely profitable if at all under standard
reimbursement levels, especially at large scale.


In our last report we used processed claim forms to show Zynex has been sending UHC
commercial patients 64 pairs of electrodes per month, an absurd number exceeding any
reasonable usage assumption (Medicare and most commercial insurers only allow 4 to
8 pairs per month if they cover TENS units). Making matters worse, Zynex was using an
improper billing code.

UHC patient


We think Zynex began flooding UHC patients with electrodes in 2017. That year
revenue per prescription increased nearly three-fold and margins turned positive
(despite no change in public TENS reimbursement policy), pushing Zynex stock over $1
for the first time since 2009. As a captive source of demand for excessive electrodes,
UHC enabled Zynex's previously floundering razor-razorblade model.

UHC Likely to Pursue Zynex for Past Reimbursements


NMR


We estimate UHC was paying ~7x more per prescription relative to other commercial
insurers.


Zynex's reliance on UHC is magnified by the fact that it's the company's only
national commercial network agreement. After February 15, Zynex will only have
network agreements with BlueCross BlueShield in six states: Hawaii, Louisiana,
Minnesota, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and West Virginia. Based on our research and
conversations with Zynex employees, BCBS TENS policies are near industry standards.


Equally concerning is that the decision signals a high probability that UHC will pursue
recovery of past payments. The insurer did so against EMSI, a competitor less than half
the size of Zynex.


During a 2018 audit UHC found EMSI was submitting claims for excessive electrodes
using the same improper billing code that Zynex has been using. UHC demanded
repayment of $5m out of a total of $16m paid. Interestingly, UHC used the threat of
network removal as leverage, but never dropped EMSI.

Zynex is Uninvestable


Exhibit 5 - Excerpt of EMSI vs UHC lawsuit


EMSI v UHC, 2020


In gauging potential repayment liability, consider that Zynex was billing for 8x the
number of electrodes (64) per commercial patient per month. Multiplying $5m by 8x
produces a potential UHC recovery demand of $40m. Alternatively, UHC's demand
of $5m was 30% of total payments. A proportional demand (an estimated $45m to
$80m of Zynex revenue since 2017) at Zynex equates to $14m to $24m. For
reference, we estimate Zynex's current cash balance is approximately $20m, accounting
for the recent acquisition and dividend.


We also expect UHC to refuse to pay outstanding payables recorded by Zynex which
we think are ~25% of accounts receivable or $6m. Zynex encountered a similar issue in
2009 when management underestimated payor discounts requiring it to write down
accounts receivable and restate revenue and net income lower for the year prior by
approximately 25% and 95% [Pg. 41].


Zynex stock is extremely vulnerable here. While it screens "cheap", consensus 2022
estimates of 30% and 40% revenue and EBITDA growth respectively, are based on
incomplete information.


Since the network loss is effective February 15, we expect 2021 results to come in
largely in-line with guidance. UHC's loss will be felt beginning in Q1 2022 and if Zynex is
fully transparent, we expect full year guidance to come in significantly below consensus
(Exhibit 2).

Appendix: Recent Acquisition Utilized Toxic Financing


We assume Zynex achieves a 2022 order total based on 95% of the Q4 2021 run-rate
(second highest quarter ever), and that revenue per order will decline to $800 vs $1100
in Q4 and $850 for the full year 2021. We think margins could be cut in half relative to
2021 based on our estimate that UHC was a huge contributor to margins. Our annual
revenue and EBITDA estimates of $120m and $12m are 31% and 66% below street
consensus respectively. We believe our estimates are optimistic/conservative and err to
the upside.


Considering the potential effects of the network loss on the viability of Zynex's business,
we believe the stock will be significantly re-rated. The lost UHC revenue will have a
disproportionate effect on margins, forcing the company to shrink considerably, in our
view. Moreover, the potential liability for past payments introduces extreme downside
scenarios and existential questions.


We recommend investors exit long positions and/or initiate short exposure. Risks to the
upside include better than expected revenue growth and positive developments with the
Fluid Monitoring System.


Recent announcements hint at the anticipated damage of UHC's new TENS coverage
policy. The sales force shrank from over 500 at the beginning of the 2021 to 430 as of
Q3. Management issued press releases announcing a patent application and enrollment
in a clinical trial for a zero-revenue product approved two years ago.


Zynex also announced the acquisition of Kestrel Labs, a Colorado-based developer of
patient monitoring devices. Kestrel, a small company with three employees on LinkedIn,
hopes to submit its two devices for FDA clearance in 2023 with marketing potentially
beginning in 2024.


Kestrel was acquired with $16m in cash and $15m in stock. $10m of the stock portion,
priced at approximately $10.12 post-split, will be held in escrow and repriced to the 30-
day volume weighted average one year from the closing date. Thus, as the stock moves
lower an increasing number of shares are required to fulfill the deal price. The 30%
move lower in Zynex shares since the announcement has already added 360k shares. If
Zynex is as impaired as we believe, the Kestrel equity financing exacerbates downside.
