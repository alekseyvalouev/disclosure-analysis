SEABRIDGE GOLD
(AMEX:SA)… DID YOU
KNOW THIS?


“Look around the table.  If you don’t see a sucker,


get up, because you’re the sucker” – Amarillo Slim


Dreams of Gold vs Reality of
Share Prices
Seabridge’s explicitly advertised and promoted
investment premise is that it is a “call option” on the
future price of gold.  Citron believes this premise is
utterly false. 
Aside from all the background noise about stock
promotions, Seabridge investors invest in the stock
because they hope it will rise in value as the price of
gold rises.  As the company has told them, it is a
levered play on gold.


But the price of Seabridge stock is not tied to the
price of gold, it is tied only to the supply and
demand for Seabridge shares.  That places
shareholder returns squarely dependent not upon
the price of gold, but upon the actions of
management and insiders.  This is precisely why the
past activities of Seabridge’s insiders are so
troubling.  However, the proof is in the pricing.


If we look at the price of Seabridge stock over the
last �ve years, we can see a huge run-up coincident
with the bull market in 2007 when gold went from
700 an ounce to 1000, and also with Agoracom’s
paid promotion of Seabridge stock.  But for the
vast majority of current Seabridge investors who

purchased the stock since 2007, their returns are
negative relative to gold.


Citron believes the real factors behind these
negative returns are the increasing dilution the
stock experiences over time as insiders liquidate
positions they acquired at very low prices, and
more stock enters the public �oat.

Gold Fever?  Or just a cold stock promotion?


Much has been said about the history of
Seabridge’s CEO/President Rudi Fronk and the gold
company bankruptcies that lurk in his background. 
Citron does not indulge in dredging up
management background unless it is relevant to
the issue at hand.  In this case, we �nd the
information to be compelling because the only
thing we can base this company on is the credibility
of management.  There is neither revenue nor
objective external data points that would allow
investors to draw an independent conclusion about
its value.


It is widely known that Rudi Fronk’s and James
Anthony’s predecessor company to Seabridge was
Greenstone Resources.  Big promises, but went
bankrupt.  Who cares?  Please read on.


Fronk and Anthony were put into Greenstone by an
operator named Ian Park. Mr. Park was the founder
of Greenstone and seems to be the Third
Musketeer in a group of deals that are


Gold is up 15% – 20% over the last two

“Wayne Wile, banned for three years in B.C.
and jailed six months in Ontario over a
decade ago, caught the attention of Canadian
regulators when he worked at Mr. Park’s
Borneo Gold in 1996 amid a massive stock
run as Borneo made its debut on the Asian
board of the TSX Venture Exchange’s
predecessor, the Vancouver Stock Exchange.”


That’s �ve public companies … all gone.


And lastly, Mr. Ian Park was one of the earliest
investors in Seabridge right before they bought the
rights to the KSM project.

What makes Mr. Park so interesting is that he
holds the dubious distinction of being the only
man in Citron’s archives who has been implicated
in two separate and distinct companies … BOTH
of which were halted by the SEC.


The �rst of these is Sedona Software (Rennaisance
Mining), which claimed to have one of the biggest
gold �nds in the world back in 2003.  We later �nd
out that Mr. Park was involved in one elaborate
stock scam… and that he and his partners were
ultimately sued by the SEC.

Mr. Park later headed a company call Sino Silver
which was halted by the SEC in 2005 for accuracy of
information and unlawful distribution of stock.

The one company that Seabridge’s management
can claim to be a “success” is Arizona Star. This was
bought in October of 2007, during the height of the
recent gold rush. The company was sold mainly for
its Cerro Casale project. Arizona took advantage of
the window of opportunity that was given to them
by panic in the gold markets.


Both Fronk and Anthony were on the board.


Yet, readers should note the following chilling
outcome.  The initial feasibility study for Cerro
Casale pegged development costs at $1.65 billion; it
has now ballooned to over $4 billion. That does not
prove the mine is unfeasible, it just tips the
risk/reward scale enormously, demonstrating the
huge risks that exist in metals mining between
“estimates” and reality.  This is a likely reason that
the M&A frenzy in Canadian junior miners has
chilled. 
This troubling track record should bring into clear
focus the concerns Citron published regarding
Seabridge’s aggressive paid stock promotion to
retail investors, including television commercials
touting “more gold ownership per share” as it states
on the tagline of its website.  (Note:  Citron
reiterates its belief that this claim is not legal under
US Securites laws.)


Citron is wrong- we issue a mea culpa


In Citron’s initial report we mentioned that only
Wall St. has been fooled by the Seabridge story.  We
must correct that statement.  It seems like only a
handful of investors (and those who bought the
private placement) have been fooled.


For a company that says they one of the largest
gold deposits in the world that is sitting right in
North America – why is there no independent
analyst coverage of them? 
Consider the state of their analyst coverage. 
Bloomberg lists 2 �rms. One is Dahlman Rose &
Co,,  who just picked up coverage on them 3 weeks
ago, just 2 weeks before they did a placement for
them …Chinese Wall anyone???

The other analyst listed is Singular Research??? 
Singular? They are not even members of FINRA —
they are more of a paid promo �rm.


So is this unusual?  We studied all 5 comparable
dual listed Canadian/US Mining Firms by market
capitalization.  This is what we found:

Cap


Analysts


Gammon
Gold


1.34 Billion 17


Northgate
Minerals


904 Million 10


Aurizon
Mines


729 Million 12


Frontier Dev
Group


574 Million 6


Seabridge 869 Million Zero, none,
nada


The bottom line here:  If SA owns a feasible mine,
despite Rudi Fronk’s loudly and publicly peddling
his prospects since 2007, then where is its
partner?  It’s no secret in the industry, which is a
very small community.  There simply is not any
other valid data point investors can rely upon to
value that prospect. 
For you media fans, here is another view of those
commercials…the shoots that ended up on the
cutting room �oor

Conclusion


It is the opinion of Citron research that Seabridge is
a clear example of a mature stock promo:  the overt
manipulation of public perception to sell shares of
dubious value.  Its claim of leverage to the price of
gold was never true; now that it has diluted and run
its story, its share price is leveraged only to its
ability to promote its shares.


With regard to selling or partnering its heavily
touted mega-prospect KSM, there’s an old
gambler’s cliché.  “Look around the table.  If you
don’t’ see a sucker, get up, because you’re the
sucker.”
