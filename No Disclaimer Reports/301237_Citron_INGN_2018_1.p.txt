Inogen (INGN): Needs to Take a Breath  
Citron puts generous target of $95 


 
 
In the past, Citron has been negative on names as a result of momentum, 
valuation, or competition.  It is rare that we get an opportunity of the type we 
currently see in Inogen.  While Wall Street was busy looking at the growth of 
this high-flying med-tech company, no one looked under the hood to find a 
future that is guaranteed to have price compression and competition. 
 
Whether you are a Laurel or a Yanny, you cannot fail to hear that Inogen should 
quickly fall 50%. 
 
Inogen Background 
 
Inogen is a self-described medical technology company that develops, 
manufactures and markets portable oxygen concentrators used to deliver 
supplemental long-term oxygen therapy to patients suffering from chronic 
respiratory conditions.  It went public in 2014 under the Jobs Act taking 
advantage of the boom in the portable oxygen concentrator market. 
 
You might know Inogen best by its many commercials that are the core of its 
direct to consumer strategy that advertise how to go from oxygen tanks to 
concentrators. https://www.ispot.tv/ad/AESz/inogen-one-g4-mary-and-shirley 
 
While this might sound like a nice but competitive business, the stock market 
has sucked on nitrous oxide and made this the most expensive company in 
either med-tech or medical supplies and definitely removed Inogen from any 
relation to the valuation of its peers. 
 
In order to show how ridiculous the share price has become relative to its 
current business and outlook, let us do a comparison of Inogen vs its peer group 
in the respiratory device market:

Inogen is afforded a “disruptive” multiple despite selling a commoditized 
product with low barriers to entry on both FDA and manufacturing.  Don't take it 
from Citron; the following quotes are from its recent 10k. 
 


 
And for those nitpickers who want to say that ABMD is more expensive, let it be 
noted that Abiomed makes proprietary artificial heart implants and spends close 
to 13% of its revenue on R&D……which takes us to the most critical point of this 
piece. 
 
Where is the science?  - Complete lack of Research and Development. 
 
For those who remember the Valeant saga, the permanent criticism was the lack 
of spending on R&D.  The bears correctly suggested you couldn’t run a viable 
pharmaceutical company without R&D.   As crazy as this may look, the following 
chart documents the total R&D spend of Inogen (and no these numbers are not 
in 000s): 


“Given the relatively low barriers to entry in the oxygen therapy device 
manufacturing market, we expect that the industry will become increasingly 
competitive in the future”. (2017 10k) 
 


“Given the relatively straightforward regulatory path in the oxygen therapy 
device manufacturing market, we expect that the industry will become 
increasingly competitive in the future”

Notice last year Inogen stepped it up by a whopping $200k.    
 
This is what the chart looks like as a % of revenue compared to its much larger 
competitors.

INGN | Minor R&D Cannot Save Inogen
Published 05/24/2018 


The only thing worse than having the lowest R&D spend is med-tech is lying to 
your investors in your annual presentation with the following: 
 


 
 
Putting R&D expenditures in perspective 
 
It should be noted that Resmed spends more in R&D in 12 days than Inogen 
spends in a year...while competing in the same respiratory products industry. 
 
Invacare while being merely a $500 mil cap company which also sell oxygen 
concentrators spends more than 3x for total R&D compared to INGN. 
 
Without sufficient R&D Inogen tells investors what its future looks like in this 
line from the 10k. 
 


 
Insider Sales 
 
While sensational and probably an overused data point by short 
sellers, the insider sales at INGN cannot be ignored for no other 
reason but this line. 





“If we are unable to continue to enhance our existing products and develop 
and market new products that respond to customer needs and preferences 
and achieve market acceptance, we may experience a decrease in demand 
for our products and our business could suffer”  (Inogen 2017 10k) 
 


Since IPO, insiders have sold 7.0m shares for a total value of 
$236 million at an average price of $33 / share.

Citron was going to do comparisons of insider sales to R&D etc, but there is no 
reason to rub salt in an open wound.  What has changed with respect to Inogen 
or its prospects since management began unloading shares? Nothing.  You have 
to imagine that even management had no reason to believe that Wall St would 
bid this stock up the way it has. 
 
The Real Inogen- How the stock achieved these levels. 
 
Noticing that it is competing with better funded companies with a non-
differentiated product, Inogen decided to take a direct to consumer model.  This 
is how the CEO described his business going forward from last month’s 
conference call.   
 
"So an existing rep in any given month they may work X number of leads that 
are already in their bucket and then Y number of new leads, brand new reps to 
come on board, it’s all new leads, you have to load them up and the spend 
tends to be a little higher to feed them until they get the steady state." 
 
"So as we hire more reps, you’ve got to have more leads or else you choke the 
reps off and starve them" 
 
The only thing that was missing was for him to tell us that coffee is for closers. 
#Glengarryglenross  #GlenGarryGlenRoss   
 
Citron called into Inogen to ask a few questions about the product. After 
speaking to a pushy sales rep who claimed if we bought today and only today 
she could take $1k off the $3500 list price as a promotion, we kindly said no.  
Foolishly we left our real phone # and have been called 3 times in the past 24 
hours.

Does any of this sound like the most expensive company in Med-tech/Med 
Supplies?? 
 
Billing Questions 
 
Another claim by management as an advantage over competition relates to 
alleged advantages in licensing and billing: 
 
“To pursue a direct-to-consumer strategy, our manufacturing competitors 
would need to meet national accreditation and state-by-state licensing 
requirements and secure Medicare billing privileges.” 
 
However, this accreditation is nothing special.  While still private for under $1 
million, Inogen got this accreditation by buying a firm called Comfort Life 
Medical Supply that according to them had “few assets besides a Medicare 
billing number.”  Doesn't sound like much of a barrier for competitors. 
 
We have not yet looked into Inogen's Medicare or insurance billing practices but 
historically in the medical device market, when the manufacturer also owns a 
distributor or a billing company, it does not take Robert Mueller to find 
misdoings. 
 
All About the Pricing 
 
Unlike most med-tech companies who enjoy patent and pricing protection, 
Inogen is operating in a space with neither.   
 
While the market for oxygen concentrators is growing, the amount providers are 
able to charge Medicare or insurance companies will most certainly follow the 
path of the traditional oxygen market.  Below is a table on the price that 
Medicare has put on oxygen.
Published 05/24/2018 


Citron can say without qualification that no amount of television commercials 
can counter the effects of falling Medicare and private pay reimbursement rates 
for a product that is certain to fall in price.  The Medicare competitive bidding 
program has become stringent in all oxygen reimbursements. 
 
Citron has no doubt that as the proliferation of portable oxygen concentrators 
emerges, pricing will contract as it does with EVERY commoditized non-
proprietary device. 
 
What is a fair stock price for Inogen? 
 
We will: 
 


• Disregard where the insiders have sold. 
• Disregard the complete lack of R&D 
• Disregard the lack of pipeline 
• Disregard the eventual price contraction of oxygen concentrators 
• Disregard it is a single product company 


 
Instead, we give Inogen the benefit of the doubt and afford it the highest 
multiple of its peer set -- which would be Resmed.   And it should be noted that 
Inogen is NO Resmed, which owns over 5,000 patents, and dominates the CPAP 
and respiratory research market. 
 
Based on Resmed’s multiple, Ingoen would trade at $92 a share 
 
If we gave it the average of the group Inogen would trade at $64 a share
Published 05/24/2018 


Citron urges investors to consider these other points when determining the real 
value of Inogen: 
 


• No razor /razor blade recurring revenue 
The home and portable units sold by Inogen do no require oxygen refills. 
https://www.inogen.com/resources/oxygen-concentrators/home-oxygen-concentrators/ 


 
• A May 2018 New England Journal of Medicine article discusses the 


overuse of supplemental oxygen.  The meta sourced study published is 
the most thorough study ever on LTOT 
https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/895760 


 
• TAM has not been properly addressed.  While the bull case rests on small 


penetration of a large TAM, it ignores that Inogen specializes in portable 
pulse machines which is only half the oxygen concentrator market… 
continuous being the other. 





       Conclusion        
 
Citron does not doubt the future of oxygen compressors. While they might be 
overprescribed, the amount of people who get diagnosed with COPD will most 
likely increase over the next 10 years.  During that time innovative companies 
will create innovative products that will serve this market. Inogen will not be 
one of them.  While Inogen no doubt has found its footing in the current market 
with TV commercials and aggressive sales reps, the air is thin at Inogen's current 
valuation and Inogen is most certainly going to be either priced out or innovated 
out of the market in the future.
