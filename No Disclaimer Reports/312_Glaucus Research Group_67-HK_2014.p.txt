report.  


CHINA LUMENA NEW MATERIALS CORP (“Lumena” or the “Company”) produces and sells 
thenardite and polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”) products in China.  We believe that Lumena has 
made numerous material misrepresentations to investors and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange 
(“HKEX”), both in its 2009 IPO prospectus and in subsequent financial statements.  In this report 
we present publicly available tax records and stamped hard copies of SAIC filings which, in our 
opinion, indicate that Lumena’s sales are 90% less than the sales reported to investors and 
regulators in the Company’s Hong Kong filings. 


PPS


1. PPS Sales and Profitability 90% Less than Reported.  According to Lumena’s HKEX 
filings, its operating subsidiary, Deyang Chemical, accounted for ~72% of its PPS
revenues in FYs 2011 and 2012.  Yet Deyang Chemical’s SAIC filings show that its 
revenues were only RMB 189mm (90% less than reported by Lumena) and RMB 
181mm (91% less than reported by Lumena) in FYs 2011 and 2012, respectively.  SAIC 
filings also show that contrary to being a profitable enterprise, Deyang Chemical barely 
broke a profit before taxes.  This suggests Lumena has been vastly overstating the size 
and profitability of its primary business segment. 


2. Deyang Tax Records Undermine Reported PPS Earnings.  A ranking of top taxpaying 
businesses for 2011 published by the city of Deyang shows that Lumena’s other PPS 
operating subsidiary, Deyang Materials, is ranked 74th, which is 58 spots behind a 
publicly listed company which reported less than RMB 89mm in total taxes paid in 2011 
(VAT and income taxes).  This means that Deyang Materials paid far less than RMB 
89mm in taxes in 2011, even though we estimate that it should have paid over RMB 
378mm in taxes in 2011 (VAT and income taxes) for Lumena’s reported PPS financials 
to be true.  


THENARDITE 


3. SAIC Filings of Largest Customer Suggest Fabricated Sales. Chengdu Yijing, 
Lumena’s largest customer, reportedly purchased RMB 339mm and RMB 443mm of 
products from the Company in 2009 and 2010, respectively.  Yet SAIC filings show that 
Chengdu Yijing’s total cost of goods sold (the amount it purchased from its suppliers) 
was RMB 37mm and RMB 35mm in 2009 and 2010, respectively, indicating that 
Lumena’s actual sales were 90% less than Lumena’s reported figures.  


4. Hard Copies of SAIC Filings Suggest Doctored Financials.  In 2010, Lumena had only 
two operating subsidiaries, both of which sold thenardite products. According to 
Lumena’s HKEX filings, these subsidiaries reportedly generated RMB 2.0 billion in 
combined revenues and RMB 1.1 billion in combined profits in 2010.  Yet SAIC filings 
for both entities show combined revenues of only RMB 151mm (7.7% of reported by 
Lumena) and no net profits!

5. Is China Really So Constipated?  Lumena claims to sell ~300,000 tons of medical 
thenardite, primarily used as a laxative, every year. If this is true, we estimate that 
Lumena would have to sell an average of 30 doses of medical thenardite ever year to 
every human being in China over the age of 14.  This simply defies credibility.


6. Hidden Beneficiary to Suspicious Transaction? In 2005, Lumena’s former Chairman 
sold an equity stake in a subsidiary to a supposedly independent third party only to buy 
back the same equity four years later, immediately after going public in 2009, with cash 
raised from the capital markets, for 3100% percent more than the price at which the 
former Chairman sold it.  Such returns appear too good to be true, raising our suspicions 
that perhaps an insider was the hidden beneficiary of the transaction.


GLOBAL
7. Lucrative Commodity Business Too Good to be True. Lumena's reported EBIT 


margin of 56% (average 2008-2012) defies credibility when we consider that other large-
scale public companies selling thenardite and PPS report EBIT margins of between 5% 
and 10%.  Indeed, Lumena reports similar EBIT margins as Mastercard (NYSE: MA).  
This does not pass the smell test.


8. Valuation. As of June 30, 2013, Lumena had approximately RMB 4.2 billion of onshore 
(PRC) bank debt outstanding and another USD 120 million of convertible bonds due 
May 12, 2014 (with an effective interest rate of 25.97%), which we believe Lumena must 
either restructure or issue over 1 billion shares in new equity in order to pay off.  In a 
liquidation scenario, the holders of onshore liabilities have historically taken priority over 
offshore equity holders. Because we believe that the Company has significantly 
overstated its sales and profitability, we doubt the authenticity of its reported receivables,
cash balance and PP&E. Given the limited offshore assets available for seizure and the 
difficulty recovering onshore assets (property and equipment) under China’s byzantine 
judicial system, we have a price target on its shares of HKD 0.00.

CIRCLING THE DRAIN


CHINA LUMENA NEW MATERIALS CORP. (“Lumena” or the “Company”) mines, processes and 
sells thenardite for use as medical thenardite (a laxative and anti-inflammatory agent) and powder 
thenardite (in detergents and textiles).  Lumena also produces and sells polyphenylene sulfide (“PPS”), a 
plastic for industrial use.  


Lumena appears to be circling the drain.  The Company’s balance sheet is weighed down by RMB 4
billion in current liabilities and RMB 3 billion in long-term liabilities.  As stated in the Company’s 2013 
interim report, Lumena must pay a 19.3% yield to maturity on USD 120 million convertible bonds issued 
by CITIC and CIC (with an effective interest rate of 25.97%), which are due in May 2014 (45 days 
from today). If Lumena had the available cash that it claims, we believe that it would not have issued 
debt at such a punitive interest rate.  Accordingly, we believe that Lumena must either restructure its 2014 
bonds or be forced to issue over 1 billion shares of new equity to pay them off, either of which may prove 
impossible with financial statements so littered with red flags. 


An Imminent Refinancing?


The Company reports similar EBIT margins (56%) from the mining and manufacturing of two 
commodities as Mastercard!  Lumena’s reported EBIT margins are five to ten times higher than the 
margins reported by competitors mining the same commodity (thenardite) and producing the same plastic 
(PPS).  Despite supposedly generating significant cash flow from operations, since going public in 2009 
Lumena has been a serial capital raiser.


There is a significant amount of evidence, including publicly available SAIC filings and government tax 
rankings to suggest both Lumena’s PPS and thenardite businesses are much smaller and less profitable 
than Lumena claims in its public filings.  Even a basic sanity check of Lumena’s financials reveals 
problems. Lumena claims to sell 300,000 tons of medical thenardite every year, which we estimate is the 
equivalent of 30 doses of medical thenardite, used primarily as a laxative, to every person over 14 years 
old in China every year – this seems prima facie absurd (and unintentionally humorous).  


We believe that Lumena has made numerous material misrepresentations to investors and the Hong Kong 
Stock Exchange (“HKEX”), both in its 2009 IPO prospectus and in subsequent financial statements 
regarding the scale of its revenues, earnings, and assets.    


We doubt that Lumena will be able to refinance its convertible bonds, due May 12, 2014, at a rate that is 
not punitive.   Indeed, Moody’s withdrew its B2 corporate rating on Lumena in December 2013, 
suggesting, in our opinion, that it is simply a matter of time before Lumena implodes.

PPS BUSINESS


In December 2010, in conjunction an equity issuance, Lumena announced the acquisition of Sino Polymer 
New Materials Co., Ltd. (“Sino Polymer”) from a consortium of shareholders including Lumena’s former 
Chairman (a 38% owner of the target).  


Sino Polymer produces polyphenylene sulfide, a crystalline aromatic polymer, used as a substitute for 
metal, primarily in automobiles, electronics and filter bags. PPS resin (together with fibers and 
compounds produced from the resin) competes with a number of other thermoplastics (PCT and PBT), 
nylons, epoxies and metals for use in a variety of industrial applications.    


While demand for PPS has been flat or declining in the US and the EU since 2008, demand in China has 
supposedly risen.  According to the Company, China accounts for almost 70% of global PPS demand.  
Lumena claimed that Sino Polymer was the largest PPS resin producer (by capacity) as of December 31, 
2009, supposedly accounting for 30% of the world’s total production and 99.7% of the PRC’s total 
production capacity.1  


Sino Polymer, a BVI shell company, held the equity interests of three operating subsidiaries: 


 Sichuan Deyang Chemical Co., Ltd. 四川得陽化學有限公司 (“Deyang Chemical”), incorporated
in April 2006;


 Sichuan Deyang Special New Materials Co., Ltd.* 四川得陽特種新材料有限公司 (“Deyang 
Materials”), incorporated in June 2007; and


 Sichuan Deyang Engineering Plastic Development Co., Ltd.* 四川得陽工程塑料開發有限公司
(“Deyang Plastics”), incorporated in March 2008 (not operational).


The growth trajectory of Sino Polymer was equal parts swift and suspicious. In three years from 
inception, Sino Polymer cornered the Chinese market to supposedly become, for all intents and purposes, 
the sole producer of PPS resin in the PRC.2  Indeed, at the time of the acquisition, Lumena announced 
that it was unlikely to face a domestic competitor.  


It is also of note that according to Lumena, Sino Polymer’s competitive moat was not derived from 
intellectual property (it had only two patents), but rather, its “technical know-how derived from 
industry experience, research and development, and recent experience with the expansion of [Sino 
Polymer’s] production capacity.”3


Put simply, in three years, Sino Polymer built an absolute domestic monopoly in a commoditized product 
with, it appears, limited intellectual property rights.  Suspicious yet?

PPS SALES AND PROFITABILITY LESS THAN REPORTED


Since inception, PPS production capacity was concentrated at two primary subsidiaries, Deyang Materials 
and Deyang Chemical.  Although both production facilities produce PPS Resin, Deyang Chemical 
produces PPS Compounds while Deyang Materials produces PPS Fiber.  


According to Lumena, Deyang Plastics was not engaged in any substantial business activities since 
inception.4  Despite the fact that production capacity appears evenly divided between the other two 
subsidiaries, Deyang Chemical produces PPS Compounds, which account for roughly 70% of the total 
revenue generated by the PPS business.


Given that Lumena’s PPS business purportedly generated RMB 2.54 billion in revenues in FY 2011, 
Deyang Chemical should have therefore accounted for around 1.825 billion (72% of PPS revenues).


Yet SAIC filings for Deyang Chemical, which contain FY 2011 financial statements, state that the 
operating subsidiary’s revenue was only RMB 189 million, roughly 90% less than the sales reported
in the Company’s reported financials.

2011 Deyang Chemical SAIC Filings


Not only do FY 2011 financial statements in Deyang Chemical’s SAIC filings indicate that the operating 
subsidiaries total sales were 90% less than reported, but SAIC records also show that the operating 
subsidiary had a pre-tax profit of only RMB 38 million.  SAIC Filings for FY 2012 tell a similar story.

2012 Deyang Chemical SAIC Filings


Lumena’s PPS business purportedly generated RMB 2.93 billion in revenues in FY 2012. Deyang 
Chemical should have therefore accounted for around RMB 2.08 billion (71% of PPS revenues).  Yet 
2012 SAIC filings for Deyang Chemical state that the operating subsidiary’s revenue was only RMB 181
million, again roughly 90% less than the sales reported in the Company’s Hong Kong financials.  In 
addition, 2012 SAIC filings show that after tax profit declined by 47% from 2011 to 2012.    


The SAIC Filings suggests that not only is Lumena fabricating PPS revenue, but that the Company 
overpaid for the RMB 10 billion acquisition of the PPS business from the former Chairman and 
other shareholders in 2011.

TAX RECORDS UNDERMINE REPORTED PPS SALES


Is it possible that Lumena’s other PPS manufacturing subsidiary, Deyang Materials, accounted for almost 
all of Lumena’s PPS revenue and profitability? We do not think so. Publicly available government tax 
records suggest that Deyang Materials is nowhere close to generating the revenues or profits necessary to 
account for reported Lumena’s PPS figures.   


The Sichuan Deyang local taxation bureau publishes an annual ranking, available to any investor online, 
which details the taxes paid by businesses operating in Deyang.  If Deyang Materials accounted for the 
remaining RMB 2.35 billion in sales for Lumena’s PPS business in 2011, it would have paid at least 
RMB 241mm in VAT and RMB 137mm in income taxes (total of RMB 378mm in taxes).5


If Deyang Materials was paying RMB 378mm in income taxes and VAT, then it would certainly appear 
highly ranked on the Deyang city rankings of top taxpaying companies in 2011.  It is not.  Rather, it is 
ranked 74th.    


To give investors some context, the 16th ranked company on the 2011 tax list (see next page) is Sichuan 
Jinlu Resin Co. Ltd. (“Sichuan Jinlu Resin”) a subsidiary of the Sichuan Jinlu Group, a Shenzhen listed 
company (SHE: 000510) (“Sichuan Jinlu Group”).  According to the 2011 annual report of the Sichuan 
Jinlu Group, the entire group paid only RMB 89.7mm in total taxes in 2011:


Source: Page 143-144 of the 2011AR, http://pg.jrj.com.cn/acc/CN_DISC/STOCK_TIME/2012/04/12/000510_nb_60817301.PDF


                                                
5 We know from SAIC filings that Deyang Chemical only accounted for RMB 83mm in gross profit in FY 2011.  For Lumena’s 
reported financials to be true, Deyang Materials would have had to generate RMB 1.415 billion in gross profit that year (RMB 
2.535 billion in PPS segment revenues * 59.1% reported segment margin less 83mm gross profit for Deyang Chemical).  
Therefore, we can estimate that Deyang Materials paid RMB 241 mm in VAT (RMB 1.415 billion gross profit times 17% VAT) 
and RMB 137 in income tax (RMB 954mm of PPS segment before tax profit less RMB 38mm Deyang Chemical before tax 
profit from SAIC filing times Deyang Materials' reported 15% effective income tax rate).

If Sichuan Jinlu Group (the conglomerate) paid RMB 89.7mm in taxes in 2011, then its Deyang city 
subsidiary, Sichuan Jinlu Resin, must have only paid a fraction of that amount. Yet Sichuan Jinlu Resin 
appears as the 16th highest taxpayer on the Deyang city taxpayer list for 2011, which is 58 places ahead 
of Deyang Materials:   


Source: http://www.dyltax.gov.cn/?tag=gonggao&id=1385


If Deyang Materials accounted for the supposed remaining gross profit and earnings before taxes of 
Lumena’s PPS business in 2011 (RMB 1.415 billion in gross profit, RMB 916mm in earnings before 
taxes), then it would have paid RMB 378mm in taxes that year (including both income taxes and VAT).  
Yet Deyang Materials appears 74th on Deyang city’s rankings of top taxpaying businesses, 58 spots below 
a publicly listed subsidiary that we know paid less than 89mm in 2011.  This is further evidence 
suggesting that Lumena’s PPS does not generate the revenues or profitability that Lumena reports to 
Hong Kong investors.

THENARDITE BUSINESS


SAIC FILINGS OF LARGEST CUSTOMER SUGGEST FABRICATED SALES


Financial statements contained in the SAIC filings of Lumena’s largest customer shows that the customer
purchased far less thenardite than Lumena claims to have sold to it.  


At the time of its August 2009 IPO, Lumena claimed that Chengdu Yijing Trading Chemical Engineering 
Co., Ltd. (“Chengdu Yijing”), was its largest customer, accounting for 7.7%, 18.1% and 23.2% of the 
Company’s total revenues in the years ended December 31, 2006, 2007 and 2008 respectively. 6  
According to Lumena’s prospectus, Chengdu Yijing sold the powder thenardite and specialty thenardite it
purchased from the Company to Proctor & Gamble for use in the multinational’s detergent products.7  


We have many reasons to believe that Chengdu Yijing remained Lumena’s largest customer in the two 
fiscal years following its IPO.  First, on August 1, 2008, Lumena entered into a new three-year sales 
contract with Chengdu Yijing through which the customer allegedly agreed to purchase between 5,000 
and 10,000 tonnes of powder thenardite per month from Lumena at a fixed price.8  


Second, sell side analysts with access to management confirmed that Chengdu Yijing remained Lumena’s 
largest customer in 2009 and 2010.9  Third, Lumena CEO Zhang Daming stated in 2009 that over 20% of 
the Company’s revenue came from sales to Proctor & Gamble, which purchases thenardite through 
Chengdu Yijing.10  Fourth, descriptions of the Company confirm that Chengdu Yijing is Lumena’s largest 
customer.11


If, as we have every reason to believe, Chengdu Yijing remained Lumena’s top customer in the two fiscal 
years following the Company’s IPO, Lumena supposedly sold Chengdu Yijing 339mm and 443mm of 
thenardite 2009 and 2010, respectively.  Chengdu Yujing’s SAIC filings should therefore confirm this 
level of purchasing activity.  


Yet SAIC filings state that Chengdu Yijing’s total cost of goods sold (the amount it purchased from its 
suppliers) was 37mm and 35mm in 2009 and 2010, respectively, which is 90% less than the amount 
Lumena claims to have sold to Chengdu Yijing in those years.  


Below we have included excerpts from Chengdu Yijing’s 2009 and 2010 SAIC filings showing its cost of 
goods sold as well as changes to its inventory balance, which together, give investors a picture of the 
customer’s limited purchasing activity.  


According to 2009 SAIC filings, Chengdu Yijing reported RMB 37 million in COGS and a decrease in 
inventory of RMB 1 million, indicating that it purchased significantly less than the RMB 336 million that 
Lumena claimed to have sold to it in 2009.

2010 SAIC filings tell a similar story.  For 2010, Chengdu Yijing reported RMB 35 million in COGS 
and an increase in inventory of RMB 1 million, indicating that it purchased significantly less than the 
RMB 443 million that Lumena claimed to have sold to it in 2010.

Put together, SAIC filings indicate that Chengdu Yijing, supposedly Lumena’s largest customer, was 
purchasing 90% less than Lumena reported in its Hong Kong filings.  This is direct and powerful 
evidence suggesting that Lumena has vastly exaggerated its sales in communications and filings 
submitted to Hong Kong regulators and investors.

HARD COPIES OF SAIC FILINGS SUPPORT DEBTWIRE ALLEGATIONS


In 2010, before Lumena acquired the PPS business, it operated exclusively through two subsidiaries, 
Sichuan Chuanmei Mirabilite Co., Ltd. 四川省川眉芒硝有限責任公司 and Sichuan Chuanmei Special 


Glauber Salt Co., Ltd. 四川川眉特種芒硝有限公司 (collectively, the “Thenardite Operating Subs”), 
both of which mined and sold thenardite products.12


Lumena’s thenardite business has been beset by controversy.  In August 2011, an article published by 
Debtwire and reprinted by the Financial Times (available here) reported that electronic copies of 
Lumena’s 2008 and 2009 SAIC filings, apparently sourced from three different credit agencies in China, 
indicated that contrary to what Lumena was telling investors, the Company’s only two operating 
subsidiaries were unprofitable.  Debtwire further reported that Lumena’s reported sales were 8x to 15x 
larger than the consolidated sales figures in the 2008 and 2009 SAIC filings that Debtwire obtained.  


Lumena responded that electronic depository files – including screenshots with the same exact time stamp 
– could not be relied upon because they were electronic records and not hard-copy SAIC filings, which 
bear the official stamp.  Lumena showed Debtwire hard copies of SAIC filings which, according to 
Lumena, vindicated the Company. Suspiciously, Lumena refused to let Debtwire keep copies of the hard-
copy SAIC filings so the market was never in a position to truly evaluate the credibility of the evidence.  
What was Lumena hiding? Why not simply publish the original hard copies with official stamps?   


Taking Lumena’s arguments at face value, we obtained hard copies of SAIC filings for the same 
operating subsidiaries, both of which bear the official stamp.  The hard copies that we obtained confirmed 
Debtwire’s allegations.  


According to its Hong Kong financials, Lumena’s Thenardite Operating Subs supposedly generated RMB 
2.0 billion in revenues and RMB 1.1 billion in profits in 2010.  Yet the hard copies of SAIC filings 
indicate that in 2010, the Thenardite Operating Subs combined to generate only RMB 151 million in 
revenues and were both unprofitable! 


Below we present excerpts of the 2010 SAIC filings for the Thenardite Operating Subs showing revenues 
and profits reported to the Chinese government:

SAIC filings indicate that the Thenardite Operating Subs generated 92% less revenue than reported to 
investors by Lumena and that, rather than making RMB 1.1 billion in profit, they were unprofitable.  
This evidence strongly indicates that Lumena is vastly exaggerating the financial performance of its 
business.  Investors ignore SAIC filings at their peril.   


History may not repeat itself, but it rhymes.  Glaucus Research published its first research report on 
March 8, 2011 (available on our website by clicking here) warning investors that SAIC filings, auditor 
and CFO turnover, outlying financial metrics and Chinese web traffic data indicated that UTA was vastly 
overstating the size and profitability of its business.13  Just over one month after the publication of our 
investment thesis, UTA’s auditor resigned and shortly thereafter trading of UTA’s shares was halted.  The 
New York Stock Exchange delisted UTA a few months later.   


On September 27, 2013, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) announced 
fraud charges against Universal Travel Group (“UTA”), and its former CEO and chairwoman, Jiangping 
Jiang and its former director and interim CFO, Jing Xie.  


In early 2011, before the wave of fraud and accounting scandals among US-listed Chinese RTOs crested, 
many US commentators dismissed SAIC filings as irrelevant and inaccurate.  But the fall of UTA is a 
potent reminder of why SAIC filings are a critical piece of publicly available evidence for investors 
performing due diligence on Chinese companies.  The reasons, which we outlined in our first report, bear 
repeating:  


 PRC law requires a company’s officer or legal representative to sign SAIC filings under an 
attestation stating: “I hereby confirm that the contents in the annual inspection report submitted 
by the company are true.”  If SAIC filings are false, that means the company’s officer lied in a 
sworn statement to the PRC government about the veracity of a company’s financial statements.   


 PRC law requires businesses to file SAIC filings, including financial statements.  Why would a 
government mandate a filing requirement but not care whether they are false? 


 Why submit false SAIC filings? Anyone dismissing SAIC filings must answer this question –
after all, what possible reason would a company complying with the law have to submit a false 
financial statement to any regulatory body, whether at home or abroad?  


 Do company’s doctor financials in their SAIC filings to lower their taxes?  SAIC filings are not 
tax returns.  Doctoring financial performance in SAIC filings will not lower a company’s tax rate.  
More importantly, if senior executives falsify regulatory filings to lower its taxes, why would any 
investor have confidence that the same senior executives would put forth truthful financial 
statements to the capital markets (especially when the rewards of lying to the capital markets 
would be so much more lucrative than shaving a few basis points of a company’s tax rate). 


Because of the differences between PRC GAAP and US GAAP (or the IFRS) and other technical 
accounting differences under Chinese law, the financial statements found in SAIC filings are not always 
an exact match to the financial statements submitted to public exchanges.  So while small discrepancies 
are to be expected between SAIC filings and a company’s publicly filed financial statements, massive 
differences between the size and profitability of a business are indicative of accounting or other 
impropriety. 


                                                
13 We would be remiss not to note the excellent research by John Hempton at Bronte capital on UTA, published on 
his blog in 2010.

IS CHINA REALLY SO CONSTIPATED?


Taken at face value, Lumena’s reported sales of medicinal thenardite simply defy credibility.  According 
to the 2010 Chinese Pharmacopoeia, a medical reference guide published by the China Pharmacopoeia 
Committee, medical thenardite is typically prescribed in a dose of 6-12 grams.14  The primary medicinal 
use for thenardite is to cure constipation, but it is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent.  


Lumena claims to be the only approved and certified medical thenardite producer in the PRC and reported 
to have sold RMB 872mm of the product in 2012, meaning medical thenardite accounted for 55% of the 
Company’s thenardite revenues and 19% of total revenues.15


In the following table we calculate the number of doses of medicinal thenardite that Lumena claims to sell 
in China per year, per person.  The results are laughable.

If Lumena’s reported financials are true, then Lumena sold the equivalent of 26 doses of thenardite to 
every person in China above the age of 14 in 2012.  Investors should ask themselves: is China really 
that constipated?  Assuming thenardite is the only cure for constipation and Lumena has 100% of the 
market share, is every Chinese person taking a thenardite laxative once every two weeks?  We do not 
think so.


There is supporting evidence to suggest that the medical thenardite market is nowhere near this size.  
Although scholarly articles on medical thenardite are rare, a 2007 submission to the Inorganic Chemicals 
Industry stated that the medical thenardite market was only 50,000 tons per year.16  


A 2011 feasibility study of medical thenardite which appears to be for Nafine Chemical (SH: 000737), a 
Lumena competitor and the largest thenardite producer in China, reported that the total demand for 
medical thenardite in China in 2011 was 50,000 tons.  Investors should also note that this article 
estimated that Lumena’s annual production of medical thenardite was only 5,000 tons (the Company 
claimed to produce 300,000 tons in 2011).17


According to both articles, the medical thenardite market is roughly 50,000 tons per year, which is the 
equivalent of 5 doses per year.  This seems much more reasonable and in line with the occurrence of 
constipation throughout the rest of the world.  


Ultimately, the market size of medical thenardite implied by Lumena’s reported sales figures appears 
simply ludicrous.  We do not believe that every person in China ingests 25-30 doses of medicinal 
thenardite per year.  Rather, we believe that this is further evidence that Lumena is simply exaggerating 
the size of its business.

HIDDEN BENEFICIARY OF A MAJOR TRANSACTION?


Almost immediately after listing on the Hong Kong exchange, Lumena bought out a purportedly 
‘independent third party’ who held a minority investment stake in the Company.  This transaction netted 
the seller a 3100% windfall on a four-year investment.  Such returns appear too good to be true, raising 
our suspicions that perhaps an insider was the hidden beneficiary of the transaction.  


In June 2005, Sichuan First Silk Printing & Dyeing Co., Ltd. (四川省德陽富斯特新合纖有限公司) 
(“Sichuan First”) purchased a 10% equity stake in Lumena subsidiary Chuanmei Mirabilite from Sichuan 
Huatong (四川华通投资控股有限公司) (“Sichuan Huatong”), a company controlled by former
Chairman Li Yan (aka Suo Lang Duo Ji, aka, Dominique Shannon).18   Sichuan First purchased its 
minority stake for the low price of RMB 8.2 million.19  


A mere four years later, Sichuan First sold the minority equity interest back to Lumena for RMB 264 
million, a return of over 3100%!  Put simply, Lumena’s former Chairman sold an equity stake in a 
subsidiary to a supposedly independent third party only to buy back the same equity four years later, 
immediately after going public, with cash raised from the capital markets, for 3100% percent more than 
the price at which the former Chairman sold it.  Such returns appear too good to be true and the 
transaction is suspicious for a number of other reasons.  


Sichuan First is a limited liability company established in the PRC on March 13, 2003, and according to 
Lumena is “owned as to 65%, 30% and 5% by Mr. Chen Gang, Mr. Liu Jun and Mr. Zhang Yong, 
respectively all being PRC individuals and independent third parties.”20  There is reason to be skeptical 
of their independence.


SAIC Filings show that Lumena’s former Chairman appointed Mr. Chen Gang, the majority owner of 
Sichuan First, to be a director of Chuanmei Mirabilitie in July 2004 and that Chen resigned in May 2005, 
only a month before the equity purchase.  It is suspicious because Chen was employed by Lumena’s 
former Chairman for his privately held company from 2004-2005, and resigned immediately before 
acquiring the minority equity stake for a song.  Did he stop working for Lumena’s former Chairman when 
he resigned in May 2005, or did Lumena’s former Chairman simply use him and his co-owners as front 
men while Lumena’s former Chairman remained the secret owner and controller of Sichuan First?   


Although we have not found sufficient evidence to close the loop and confirm that this scenario took 
place, we believe that the transaction is a red flag given the timing of the acquisition and the 3100% 
returns of the minority investor.

REPORTED FINANCIALS TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE


Investors may come to the conclusion that Lumena is fabricating its financial statements without the 
amount of due diligence that we performed. For example, we should not expect commodity chemicals 
such as thenardite (35% of 2012 Lumena sales) and PPS (65%) to consistently earn double-digit margins, 
nor should we expect one player within a commoditized industry to significantly outperform its peer 
group.  


Yet Lumena's EBIT margin for 2012 is so far superior to its peers, including Japan's DIC Corporation, 
which has a 25% global market share in PPS,21 that Lumena’s reported financial performance simply 
defies credibility.


A historical comparison reveals much the same: Lumena’s EBIT margins hover between 50% and 65% 
(truly astonishing) while other companies manufacturing thenardite or PPS chemicals squeak by with 
EBIT margins of between 3% and 10%.

VALUATION


Lumena appears to be circling the drain.  Moody’s withdrew its B2 corporate rating on Lumena in 
December 2013, the timing of which could not be worse considering Lumena must soon redeem its May 
2014 convertible bonds.  Lumena must pay a 19.3% yield to maturity on the convertible bonds (with an 
effective interest rate of 25.97%), suggesting that the market already considers the Company to be a 
significant credit risk. 


In this report, we presented a wealth of publicly available evidence to support our opinion that Lumena’s 
sales are 90% less than the sales reported to investors and regulators in the Company’s Hong Kong 
filings.  We also believe that the Company has inflated the value of assets such as its cash, receivables,
and the value of its property, plant and equipment.  After all, if a company is booking fake sales, such 
receipts must be accounted for on the balance sheet. 


In our valuation, we estimate that Lumena’s revenues are 10% of reported (an opinion based on the 
evidence presented in this report) and that Lumena’s actual EBIT margin for PPS/thenardite is 5% (based 
on the margins reported by its competitors).


Given the limited offshore assets available for seizure and the difficulty recovering onshore assets 
(property and equipment) under China’s byzantine judicial system, our price target on its HKEX-listed 
shares is HKD 0.00.
