Cellular Biomedicine Group Exposed: Outside CAR-T Experts Identify
Multiple Red Flags

by: Melissa Davis


Summary


A Chinese reverse merger that has tried to package itself as a valuable “CAR-T”
player, Cellular BioMedicine Group (CBMG) owes much of its bloated valuation to
misleading spin.


CBMG has boldly trumpeted "positive" clinical results that actually look pathetic
when compared to those reported by legitimate CAR-T players with far more
impressive cancer therapies.


Some independent CAR-T experts recently examined CBMG’s clinical trials and
raised serious concerns about everything from the sloppy nature of its studies to the
poor response to its treatments.


One CAR-T expert questioned whether CBMG should even move forward with its
plans for large-scale trials at this point, while another came right out and declared
CBMG a "risky" investment.


A recent addition to the Russell 3000, CBMG qualified for inclusion in that index after
providing a U.S. address that’s located in a building with no sign of the company.


Author's Update (September 28, 2015): In the original version of this article, the author
mistakenly reported that CBMG had also purchased an experimental CART-33 therapy for
acute myeloid leukemia tested by its lead investigator on a single leukemia patient who
died soon after undergoing that risky cancer treatment. One of the CAR-T experts who
reviewed CBMG’s clinical results discussed that CART-33 therapy in his report as well.
The author wishes to apologize for any confusion that resulted from the inclusion of that
material.


Don't confuse Cellular Biomedicine Group (NASDAQ:CBMG) with the wildly popular CAR-
T (chimeric antigen receptor T-cell) players that the company has set out to imitate. A
Chinese reverse merger that traded on the penny-stock exchange until last year, CBMG
has invested so little in its own CAR-T therapies - and those treatments have performed

so poorly in clinical trials conducted with so little scientific discipline - (1) , (2) , (3) , (4) -
that the company looks more like some phony Chinese knockoff than a bargain-priced
version of the real thing.


Clearly smelling opportunity, CBMG shifted its focus to CAR-T therapy earlier this year
after watching legitimate CAR-T players such as newly public Juno Therapeutics
(NASDAQ:JUNO) and Kite Pharma (NASDAQ:KITE) suddenly take the stock market by
storm. If CBMG really wanted to make a name for itself in the CAR-T field, however, the
company probably should have spent a whole lot more than $2 million to pick up some
discarded CAR-T technology developed by a virtual industry novice at a Chinese hospital
linked to a horrific prisoner organ-harvesting scandal.


Talk about frugal. CBMG must have decided to cut corners on its corporate headquarters,
too. Just pay a visit to 530 University Avenue, Suite 17, in Palo Alto, California, the
address that CBMG lists for its home office, and try to find any sign of the company. A paid
"gopher" has already searched the entire building for CBMG twice in recent months and
wound up striking out on both occasions. No office or mailbox bearing the company's
name. No building tenant who remembers the elusive company, either.


Big surprise: CBMG did not respond to telephone and email messages seeking answers
to questions for this story.


As a Chinese firm that recently qualified for inclusion in the Russell 3000 index with the
help of a U.S. address, CBMG better hope that it has established a verifiable presence in
the building - or at least the country - that the company claims as its home base. With
index-based funds forced to automatically purchase an estimated 830,000 shares of
CBMG when the Russell 3000 added the company to its list, the firm's thinly traded stock
could suffer a rather nasty hit of those funds suddenly released a flood of shares onto the
open market.


Granted, CBMG needs more than a U.S. office (even a fancy one) to prove that it's for
real. The company must produce some decent clinical data that's actually worthy of
respect.


When a pair of seasoned CAR-T specialists recently examined the clinical trials conducted
on CBMG's experimental cancer therapies, however, they seemed decidedly
unimpressed, to say the very least. They raised all sorts of concerns about the poor
design and weak results of those CAR-T studies: - (1) , (2) , (3) , (4) - with one of them
questioning whether the company should even move forward with its plans to start testing
its experimental therapies on larger populations of fragile cancer patients.

"I assume that the low therapeutic efficacy and high rate and severity of side effects
are due to the high cell doses and the low performance and fitness of applied cells,"
explained Dr. Hinrich Abken, an immunology professor at the University of Cologne
in Germany with more than two decades of experience in the rapidly evolving CAR-T
field.


"From the scientific point of view, I recommend to improve the current protocol of
both T-cell manufacturing and patient care in order to obtain success rates in the
range of the competitors before starting a Phase II trial. While hard to evaluate
without knowing details of the protocol, some steps in the whole process still are
likely sub-optimal and may need substantial improvement before entering large-
scale trials."


Report Card


No kidding. Simply compare the results of CBMG's most recent CAR-T trial with those
reported by genuine leaders in the field. As illustrated in the handy chart below (the first of
several that include clinical data on rival treatments supplied by a detailed industry report),
CBMG's experimental CART CD-19 treatment for leukemia stands out as the worst
performer - by far - in that group of otherwise promising cancer therapies.

For its part, CBMG has tried to make excuses for the low success rate of its CAR-T
therapies by claiming that the patients who participated in its clinical trials entered those
studies with particularly resistant forms of cancer and/or without the benefit provided by
preconditioning chemotherapy. The patients who arguably fared the worst in the
company's CART19 trial for leukemia actually did receive preconditioning chemotherapy,
however, while those who fared the best - including at least one patient who also received
a highly effective cancer drug in addition to the experimental CAR-T treatment - required
no preconditioning chemotherapy due to the mild state of their disease.

* From CBMG's most recent quarterly report: "The treatment program design of this study
is very stringent. Our higher-risk patients did not receive conditioning chemotherapy, which
is known as a beneficial facilitator of adoptive T cell therapies."


The results of CBMG's remaining CAR-T studies look pretty dismal, too. In two trials,
designed to test the company's CART30 and CART20 therapies as treatments for different
types of lymphoma, the patients tended to fare measurably - if not significantly - worse
than those fortunate enough to participate in larger trials hosted by the competition.

"It's true that CBMG's clinical trial results … are not as impressive compared to other
groups in the U.S.," noted Dr. Pranay Khare, a professional consultant who
specializes in the manufacturing process used to develop effective CAR-T
treatments. "I may be wrong, but it feels like the authors were under pressure or
under influence to get clinical trial results …


"Of course, investment with this quality of data would be risky," Khare emphasized.
Moreover, "this quality of data would NOT be appreciated in the CART field."


Overblown Hype


CBMG has managed to win glowing reviews from a handful of promotional biotech
"analysts" who should spend a little more time on their homework, though.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3533746-cellular-biomedicine-group-exposed-outside-car-t-experts-identify-multiple-red-flags 7/13


Just last week, for example, CBMG secured a ringing endorsement from a pair of analysts
interviewed by a biotech newsletter that the company happened to sponsor. "It's all about
data for John McMamant and Jay Silverman," The Life Sciences Report assured when
introducing the duo, who then proceeded to name CBMG as one of their favorite stock
picks based upon a rather generous impression of the company's CAR-T portfolio.


Maybe those new CBMG cheerleaders paid a little more attention to the company's
positive spin than they realized or would care to admit. Listen to a sample of their rosy
analysis, and see if it sounds more influenced by CBMG's clinical data or by the
company's bullish sales pitch.


"Cellular BioMedicine is putting together a huge portfolio of assets in cancer - and
specifically in immuno-oncology - that it will be able to sell," they gushed. "Basically,
in less than a calendar year, the company has created an immuno-oncology portfolio
that has already begun to generate data on par with anything else being developed,
at least in the first generation ...


"The key for this company is data, and it has delivered some," they continued. "We
have already seen signs of efficacy with the technology, and we have more data
coming this fall. This technology is for real."


Picture CBMG taking a deep bow.


If CBMG basked in the glory of that welcome praise, the company must feel downright
spoiled by all of the favorable research coverage that it has received from a former
consultant who fell in love with its stock and soon turned into the firm's most loyal
cheerleader. Within a few short months of collecting his consulting fees, LifeTech Capital
analyst Stephen Dunn started promoting CBMG as a promising Chinese biotech company
armed with valuable CAR-T technology worth a potential fortune. Even though CBMG had
paid less than $2 million for those CAR-T therapies and should have known that at least
one of them had fared poorly in early clinical studies published before those assets
actually changed hands - (1) , (2) - Dunn immediately increased the value of the
company's CAR-T portfolio all the way from $25 million to $129 million and practically
assumed that all of those treatments would perform well enough to advance through the
entire clinical trial process.

"With four human clinical and two preclinical programs in immuno-onology, CBMG is
now the leader in China for this promising cancer technology," Dunn proclaimed at
the time.


"We are expecting all four CAR T-cell drug candidates to advance into Phase IIb/III
clinical trials treating various forms of leukemia and lymphoma, as well as lung
cancer. (Meanwhile), it is important to note that comparable valuations in the CAR T-
cell space are significantly higher than our $129 million valuation of CBMG's CAR T-
cell program and could represent significant upside to our target price, as more
details and timelines emerge."


With CBMG spinning the weak results of three CAR-T studies since then (one of them
published months before the company bought its new cancer therapies), Dunn has
responded by dutifully following management's lead while steadily boosting the estimated
value of the firm's CAR-T portfolio from roughly $130 million to $170 million for no
apparent reason.


Last month, however, CBMG ran into an unwelcome obstacle that forced Dunn to slash
another lofty projection and should have taught the analyst an important lesson. When
CBMG supplemented its cancer portfolio this summer by paying $4.25 million for an
experimental vaccine (using its stock to cover a major chunk of that bill), Dunn promptly
added a staggering $110 million to his already generous valuation of the young biotech
company. That projection soon proved wildly optimistic, however, when CBMG suddenly
found itself on the hook for expensive clinical trials of its new vaccine after the original
sponsor elected to shift that costly burden to the company instead. With that program
thrown into jeopardy, Dunn cut the estimated value of CBMG's new vaccine in half but
found a way to offset much of that reduction by quietly assigning even more value to the
remaining assets in the firm's cancer portfolio.


CBMG better hope that it can escape punishment for yet another nasty surprise. Within
days, CBMG will share the clinical results of an experimental CAR-T therapy for lung
cancer and other solid tumors that (absent some kind of fluke or miracle) could soon make
the firm's CAR-T portfolio seem like a total failure.


Given the lack of clinical evidence to suggest that CAR-T treatments even work on
cancers outside of certain types of leukemia and lymphoma - far less challenging targets
that nevertheless responded poorly to the company's own therapies - CBMG cannot easily
spin the results of that study without catching the attention of curious industry leaders
capable of seeing right through its positive hype. If CBMG feels tempted to take its

chances, the company might want to spend of few moments reviewing some of the red
flags raised by CAR-T experts who examined its previous trials so that the firm can better
calculate its odds of success.


Expert Opinions


Dr. Khare identified a number of serious issues that make the company's CAR-T trials look
downright sloppy and the poor quality of its clinical data seem even worse. After
scrutinizing the firm's CAR-T studies, he specifically (and, in some cases, repeatedly)
emphasized the following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3533746-cellular-biomedicine-group-exposed-outside-car-t-experts-identify-multiple-red-flags 10/13


"Overall, the investigator tried to achieve too much information from a small trial. The
trial has too many variables, including patient diseases, dose infusion, autologous
and donor-derived CART19 infusion, etc. There is a lack of proper controls in
experimental procedures."


"The information provided in ClinicalTrials.gov and the data provided in the accepted
manuscripts is very different … According to ClinicalTrials.gov, the genetic
modification of patient-autologous or donor-derived T cells with anti-CD19-CAR anti-
CD20-CAR or anti-CD33-CAR was performed using retroviral vector-transduction.
But in all the manuscripts, the group is using the lentiviral vector method. I hope the
group understands the difference in these two vector systems … For me, the change
in viral vector is really a lack of knowledge or literature understanding."


"Most of the CART researchers, including us, define the dose before trials. It could
be a definite dose or dose per patient body weight or dose per tumor volume. Surely,
it seems that the CBMG group has not presented any rationale for their dose
selection. The trial was performed in China, and I am not aware of their IRB rules
and regulations, but dose selection suggests their lack of scientific understanding."


· "The change in the normal infusion process by the CBMG group is very disturbing,
unless there is a scientific rationale. In the CART field, it takes two or more weeks to
prepare a patient's cells, but to infuse them at different times does not make sense.
Second dose infusion in some patients is very disturbing and was absolutely not part
of their therapeutic regiment."


"The group thinks that CD3 staining is their CART20 cells. It's just a speculation and
not a good way to show data … To presume that CD3+ cells are CART is naïve and
surely needs to be confirmed with additional reagents or methods."


"Other CART researchers have prepared several reagents to identify and confirm
the presence of live CART from cell culture, blood and tissues obtained from
patients. cells, either from cell culture or from blood and tissues obtained from
patients … The CBMG group has spent very limited time to understand the utility of
these reagents and mainly uses the qPCR method, which can be informative, but
other data needs to be collected to confirm the findings … This feels like a lack of
scientific understanding and ignorance" on the part of the CBMG group.


Dr. Abken found the company's CAR-T studies problematic as well. He identified a
number of weaknesses, too, including (among others) the following:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3533746-cellular-biomedicine-group-exposed-outside-car-t-experts-identify-multiple-red-flags 11/13


"The success rate of the CD19 trial (first 9 patients), as reported by the press
release (March 25, 2015), is far below the overall rate at other centers. The same
applies to the published data on the first 7 patients treated in the CD20 CAR-T trial
… The CD30 CAR-T trial has a lower success rate compared to the Baylor College
CD30 trial" as well.


"Patients experienced substantial side effects, as far as reported. For instance,
CD19 and CD20 CAR-T treatment was associated with high-grade GvHD toxicities
with above-average frequencies, including Grade 4 GvHD."


"Of note, side effects like 'cytokine storm' and vascular leakage syndrome are more
likely and more severe when high cell doses are applied. The high cell dose may
therefore contribute to the high frequency of side effects seen in the CBMG trials. On
the other hand, increase in cell dose does not compensate for low fitness of
engineered T-cells, which points me to assuming that the fitness of applied cells may
not be optimal."


"The CAR-T trials stand isolated in CBMG's overall clinical trial program. The other
programs aim at treating cancer-unrelated diseases, like degenerative disease and
osteoarthritis, or the programs use other technologies and cells, like human adipose-
derived progenitor cells. I cannot see a link between these programs or an added
value by combining (them)."


"Dr. Han (the lead investigator in charge of the company's CAR-T trials) is said to be
a 'renowned key opinion leader in the cancer immunotherapy field' (press release
Feb. 9, 2015) … PubMed records more than 40 publications by Dr. Han; however,
only two of them are on adoptive cell therapy with CAR-modified cells … I myself,
working in the field of CAR-T cells since the very early beginning - (NYSE:FOR)
more than 20 years - do not know Dr. Han and do not remember a major scientific
meeting where Dr. Han showed up with his own data or innovative strategies. I do
not see Dr. Han as an outstanding expert in the field of CAR-T cell therapy."
