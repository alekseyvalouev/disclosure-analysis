office, we believe that 70 salespeople is a fair estimate of the number of salespeople CCME has. 
 


 
 
Because VISN has a somewhat similar business model to that of CCME, we chose VISN’s 
revenue per sales and marketing employee as a baseline.  For the numerous reasons outlined in 
this report, we believe that the productivity of a CCME salesperson would be far less than that of 
his counterpart at VISN.  (Our dealing with a salesperson in CCME’s Fuzhou headquarters 
reinforced that view.)   
 
Regardless, we discounted the productivity of VISN’s salespeople only 25%.  Multiplying that 
by our estimate of 70 salespeople, we arrive at $17.2 million in revenue.  We note that FMCN 
had a 2009 net income margin of 9%.  AMCN and VISN both lost money that year.  To be 
generous to CCME, if we assume it had a 10% net income margin, then it generated net income 
of $1.7 million or diluted EPS of $.05.

CCME may respond that it has an army of agents serving as proxy salespeople, but that would 
further call into question its gross margin.  Agencies would clearly seek to earn a return on their 
investments in staff.
