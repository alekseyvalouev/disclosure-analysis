 WU has only missed earnings estimates 
once since the beginning of 2012, and we 
find these consistent earnings beats 
questionable, especially from a mature 
company facing secular decline. 
 


 We have concerns over WU’s accounting 
as it relates to cost capitalization and 
believe Management is manipulating 
earnings to influence its share price. 





 WU’s unusually low tax rates, combined 
with the nature of a business model, 
viewed by many as predatory, raise 
concerns of public policy backlash.

The fundamentals of Western Union (“the Company”, “WU”) are deteriorating and the Company has 
been losing agent exclusivity. Although Management has been resistant to any aggressive price cuts, we 
believe such cuts are imminent. The last time WU initiated large price cuts was in 2012, and following 
the announcement, the share price dropped 30%. We believe a repeat is likely. 
 
We also have concerns over WU’s accounting. WU has only missed earnings estimates once since the 
beginning of 2012 (14 quarters). We find these consistent earnings beats questionable. The earnings of 
such a mature company facing secular decline shouldn’t be that hard for Wall Street's finest to forecast. 
Based on the evidence and available information we have reviewed and analyzed, all of which we set 
out herein, we believe that WU is manipulating its EPS numbers through cost capitalizations in order to 
beat analyst estimates and directly influence its share price. Our analysis suggests that since the 
beginning of 2012, the Company’s largest quarterly share price declines have been followed by 
unusually large capitalization of contract costs. Because capitalized costs don’t flow through the income 
statement, we believe WU was able to report more favorable earnings results to the market, which in 
turn had the effect of either stemming the share price decline, or reversing it. 
 
WU’s reported tax rates have also been declining over the years and are some of the lowest among our 
analysis of multinationals. There is growing discontent over tax minimization strategies, which have 
become a hot topic for countries the world over. In Europe, numerous governments are strapped for 
cash while in much of the rest of the world countries that relied on the commodities boom are seeing 
large holes in their budgets. Companies like WU, which are already viewed by many as preying on the 
poor,


1
 do business in all these countries, yet appear to pay little, if any taxes. From a public policy 


perspective, we take issue with WU’s low tax rates, and believe they face severe headline risk. If 
anything, the case of Valeant is a sobering reminder of the problems that can quickly spawn when 
corporate practices are seen as exploitive and unfair.

Western Union is a provider of money transfer services, operating through a network of approximately 
500,000 agents globally. 
 
Where once WU’s yellow signs were synonymous with money transfers, the industry is now crowded 
with countless convenient alternatives, ranging from electronic options such as Paypal, Xoom, and 
numerous start-ups, to more traditional brick-and-mortar options, such as Moneygram (“MGI”) and Ria. 
Recently, even Wal-Mart jumped into the arena with its own money transfer service.


3
 


 
While more traditional operators are making WU’s dominance in the legacy retail space a distant 
memory, the entire industry is being displaced by online and digital alternatives. WU’s near-monopoly in 
the global money transfer industry and its premium pricing is being eroded by these disrupters the same 
way the taxi industry is being dismantled by Uber.

With an industry ripe with fresh competition, any portfolio manager that owned the stock over the last 
five years should have been fired, because the stock has gone nowhere while the market is up ~70%.

There is perhaps no better indication of WU’s deteriorating fundamentals than its agent locations count. 
WU’s agent count peaked in Q2 2013 at 520,000 locations. In Q3 2013, the Company disclosed its agent 
count at 515,000.


 5
 The latter disclosure was notable because it marked the first agent decline in the 


Company’s history, and it was also the last time the Company would disclose this number. 
 
Today, the only disclosure WU provides concerning its agent count is a vague statement noting that the 
Company has “a combined network of over 500,000 agent locations…”


6
 For a company that once took 


pride in its vast network of agent locations, and paraded them as a clear advantage over competitors, 
Management’s recent lack of disclosure on the subject is telling. 
 
WU had envisioned having 1 million touch points as recently as 2012.


7
 But that seems like a distant 


memory now. In the meantime, competitors have been ramping up their own agent locations and 
choking WU of any effective monopoly it may have held in the past. For example, MGI has increased its 
agent locations by 50% from 233,000 to 353,000 since the beginning of 2011.


8
 


 
Likewise, Ria has been on its own agent acquisition spree, increasing its location count by 150% from 
107,700 to 272,000 in the same time period.

Along with agent locations, WU’s revenue also peaked, reaching US$5.6 billion in 2012. Since then, 
revenue has declined as growth rates have turned negative:

Part of the issue is pricing. WU believes its brand carries a “trust factor” which allows it to charge 
premium prices.


10
 Globally, WU charges 15% to 20% more than its competitors.


11
  


 
We believe Management’s notion of charging a 20% trust premium is antiquated. WU is no longer the 
only visible player in global remittance, and as more competitors become established and take 
mindshare, WU will be left with two options: keep its premium pricing and lose market share, or cut 
prices and lose on margins. Both scenarios are unenviable. 
 
For all the talk of premium pricing, this rhetoric was put to the test in 2012 as competition ate away at 
WU’s market share. In response, WU was forced to announce an “accelerating pricing investment” 
strategy


12
  – which is just a really obnoxious way of saying “aggressive price cuts”. Following the 


announcement, the share price responded with a 30% drop:

WU’s aggressive price cuts led to some short-term, albeit fleeting market share gains as C2C transaction 
activity rebounded sharply in 2013, and was followed by nominal revenue growth in 2014:

Credit where its due, this play-out is consistent with Management commentary regarding price cuts at 
the time:  
 


“I know it's about 12 to 18 months. It may -- in most of the time, within the 12 months, 
the revenues are coming back. And the first 2 months, you will immediately see the 
transaction increase market share's gain, and we have done that, and we will be active 
on the market to gain market share.”

However, any lasting benefits from the 2012 price cuts are elusive. While transactions did rebound 
immediately following the price cuts, those same growth rates have dropped dramatically in the last 
three quarters. Moreover, the revenue growth Management was hoping for seems muted. C2C revenue 
only grew for a portion of 2014 – barely – only to once again return to negative territory. 
 
When WU announced the aggressive price cuts back in 2012, revenue growth, transaction growth, and 
principal per transaction in the C2C segment (representing 80% of revenue)


13
 were deteriorating 


materially in the four quarters prior to the announcement:

Today, the situation is worse. Revenue growth has already turned negative, transaction growth is more 
sluggish than last time, and principal per transaction is far deeper in negative territory:

Given the pattern, we believe WU will be forced to pursue a second round of “accelerating pricing 
investment” similar to 2012 when the stock dived 30%. On the Q2 conference call in July, CFO Rajesh 
Agrawal stated, “I don’t feel that for this year we’re going to do big pricing investments.”


14
 This 


statement implies big price cuts are on the table and only a matter of time, but given the sharp turn in 
the business, we don’t see how the Company can wait.

A common sound-bite is that WU is a great business because its agent locations give it a moat.


15
 


 
…No it doesn’t, because this isn’t 1993. 
 
Generally, WU signs on agents at existing retail stores such as pharmacies and post offices. These 
locations do not require any additional investments to become WU agents, and any agency fees 
translate to ~100% incremental margins for the establishment. It was this promise of additional income 
at minimal investment that once allowed WU to recruit agents and rapidly expand its global footprint.  
 
However, this barrier-free model is now being used by competitors to recruit their own agents, often at 
the same locations as WU. Representatives from MGI and Ria can (and do) go to locations where WU 
has a presence and ask the location to also sign on as their agent. With little to no incremental costs and 
the option of additional income streams, the WU agents have little reason not to sign up with other 
money transfer operators as well. 
 
To maintain its moat and prevent this type of competitive incursion, WU has historically signed 
exclusivity agreements with its agents. However, more and more countries are deeming these 
agreements anti-competitive, and thus illegal. The first of these countries were Russia and Ukraine circa 
2007, but the list has grown considerably in the last eight years. 
 
A few short years ago, almost all of WU’s agents were exclusive. Today, most of WU’s agents are non-
exclusive, electing to become agents for multiple brands under the same roof, as evidenced by the 
changing language in WU’s disclosures over time: 
 
2007 10-K: “… nearly all of the Western Union branded agents offer our services on an exclusive basis… 
Russia and Ukraine have each enacted laws that effectively prohibit… exclusive arrangements with 
banks in those countries.” 
 
2009 10-K: “… most of our Western Union branded agents have offered our services on an exclusive 
basis… Recently, several countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and South Asia 
have promulgated laws or regulations that effectively prohibit… exclusive arrangements with agents in 
those countries.” 
 
2012 10-K: “… most of our Western Union branded agents offer our services on an exclusive basis… 
Recently, several countries in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States, Africa and 
South Asia, including India, have promulgated laws or regulations… which effectively prohibit… exclusive 
arrangements with agents in those countries. In addition to legal challenges, certain of our agents and 
their subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements. 
 
2014 10-K: “… many of our Western Union branded agents have agreed to offer only our money transfer 
services… Over the past several years, several countries in Eastern Europe, the Commonwealth of 
Independent States, Africa and South Asia, including India, have promulgated laws or regulations…

which effectively prohibit… exclusive arrangements with agents in those countries. In addition to legal 
challenges, certain of our agents and their subagents have refused to enter into exclusive arrangements. 
The inability to enter into exclusive arrangements or to maintain our exclusive rights in agent 
contracts in certain situations could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of 
operations by, for example, allowing competitors to benefit from the goodwill associated with the 
Western Union brand at our agent locations. 
 
In 2012, WU lost its near 20-year exclusive relationship with Grupo Elektra in Mexico.


16
 Since then, WU’s 


business in Mexico – a key market – has suffered as the Company has cut commission rates to stay 
competitive. Between 2012 and the most recent quarter, WU slashed its total fees for the US-Mexico 
corridor by 26% for a US$200 principal transfer: 
 


Exhibit 8

(as a percent of US$200 principal) 


 
Source: World Bank 


 
 
WU’s price cut in the US-Mexico corridor is by no means unique. Remittance companies are often seen 
as predatory, charging the lower economic strata obscene fees to remit money to their families. These 
often unbanked individuals and migrant workers are the most in need of consumer protection 
measures. Accordingly, governments of all stripes – with input from a key World Bank program – have 
been aggressively focusing their regulatory efforts on ending egregious remittance fees and 
monopolistic business practices.


17
 As more countries pass legislation to ban the type of exclusivity 


agreements that WU had formerly enjoyed, WU’s dominant position in the market will continue to 
erode to the benefit of rivals and consumers.

Not only have WU’s revenue figures declined after hitting a peak in 2012, margins have deteriorated as 
well. Exhibit 9 shows MGI’s and Ria’s footprint over time (as measured by WU/MGI and WU/Ria ratios), 
relative to WU’s C2C operating margins (C2C represented over 100% of WU’s operating profit in Q2):

operating margins of 28.6%. Today those figures stand at 1.4 and 23.3%, respectively, representing a 
decrease in margins of 530 basis points. Our regression analysis shows that there is a high correlation 
between MGI’s increasing footprint and WU’s decreasing C2C operating margins, with an R


2
 of 78%:

As the gap in agent count between WU and its competitors narrows, and as more agents refuse to sign 
exclusivity contracts, WU’s revenue and margins will both continue to decline. This decline is likely to 
persist indefinitely. While WU location count has already peaked, competitors continue to expand 
aggressively. 
 


WU has a moat? Doubtful.

Person A: Hey, remember back when you had to actually walk to the

Person B: No. 
Person A: Yeah, me neither. 





Digital Competition 
 
WU’s core business is its retail-based cash-to-cash transfer operations, which caters extensively to the 
world’s unbanked population. WU clearly dominates the physical remittance space owing to its global 
network of agent locations. However, while competition from the likes of MGI and Ria have increased in 
this legacy space, the proportion of the world’s unbanked population has simultaneously shrunk. 
Between 2011 and 2014, the global percentage of adults with an account increased from 51% to 62%.


19
 


Meanwhile, a sea of disruptive digital alternatives has emerged in the money remittance space offering 
convenience and record low transfer fees. 
 
WU has tried to stay relevant in the digital space by launching online transfer services through 
westernunion.com (“WU.com”). While WU.com showed strong growth in its early days given its small 
starting base, WU’s digital offerings have fallen far short of expectations. Initially, Management had 
targeted US$500 million revenue from digital by 2015. But that target became unrealistic and the date 
was pushed out to “beyond 2015”.


20
 For fiscal 2014, revenue from digital represented only 6% of total 


Company revenue, or US$336.4 million, up from US$277 million in 2013.
21


  
 
WU’s failure to hit its mark on digital may have to do with the fact that consumers don’t necessarily 
think of WU as an online player. WU has historically been associated with a physical store-front with a 
yellow sign and bulletproof glass with a small slit to interact with agents. When people want to send 
money digitally, they look to options that specialize in online services. For example, Google Trends 
shows that searches for Xoom.com are nearly 4x as popular as searches for westernunion.com. Xoom is 
a prominent online money transfer service that currently operates in 39 countries, and offers cash 
pickup, direct deposits, and to-your-door money delivery:

What Happens When Xoom Enters a Market? 
 
While the Company does not break out revenue beyond its US-US and US-Mexico corridors, US-India, 
US-Philippines, and US-China are also key markets, as evidenced by WU’s US website, where the US, 
China, India, Mexico, and the Philippines are first-choiced on the ‘Destination’ menu:

14 
 


 
Xoom already has an established presence in Mexico, India, and the Philippines. As a response to 
competition, WU has lowered its online transfer fees in these corridors by between 20% to 44% since 
2012, according to World Bank data. By contrast, fee transfers to China, where Xoom has been absent, 
have remained high. However, Xoom announced earlier this year that it is now entering China and we 
expect that WU will have no choice but to cut its prices in in the country to stay relevant.

Given all the competitive and structural challenges facing WU, it’s surprising that the Company’s share 
price has resisted gravity and managed to stay unchanged over the last five years. However, our analysis 
of the available evidence suggests that the Company may be manipulating its earnings in order to 
directly influence its share price. 
 
Going as far back as nine years to its 2006 spin-off as a public company, WU has only missed earnings 
estimates three times in 36 quarters, according to Capital IQ. More recently, WU has only missed 
earnings estimates once since the beginning of 2012 (14 quarters): 
 


Exhibit 14

We find these consistent earnings beats questionable. The earnings of such a mature company in secular 
decline shouldn’t be this hard for Wall Street's finest to forecast. In contrast, WU has only managed to 
beat quarterly revenue estimates half the time since 2012:

Accounting Concerns
16 
 


The probability distribution of revenue beats reflects what we would expect from numbers that were 
not a function of management influence. Revenue recognition under GAAP is far less susceptible to 
accounting games than earnings. On the other hand, we believe the consistent and unlikely earnings 
beats are either the result of analysts systematically low-balling their earnings estimates over the course 
of nearly a decade, or WU is engaged in earnings management to meet or beat EPS estimates in an 
attempt to prop up its share price. 





Capitalizing Costs and Share Price Pops  
 
Our analysis shows that since the beginning of 2012, the largest quarterly share price declines have been 
followed by substantial capitalization of contract costs by WU. Since capitalized costs don’t flow through 
the income statement, we believe WU was able to report more favorable earnings results to the market, 
which in turn had the effect of either stemming the share price decline, or reversing it:

Std Dev         17.1       


Source: Company filings, our analysis. ‘Adjusted EPS Beat’ represent our calculations of how much WU would have 
beat/missed earnings if they had expensed capitalized costs in excess of the $31.6 million average.
17 
 


Since 2012, WU has averaged US$31.6 million in the capitalization of contract costs per quarter, with a 
standard deviation of ±US$17.1 million. In effect, we would generally expect quarterly capitalization 
costs to fall below US$48.6 million most of the time.  
 
However, in Q1 2012, Q4 2012, Q4 2013, and most recently, Q2 2015, WU reported capitalized contract 
costs outside this upper range. The timing of these four deviations is suspect, because they came 
directly after the four worst quarterly share price performances since 2012. 
 
More recently, WU reported large capitalization of contract costs last quarter, beating earnings 
estimates. Our adjustments suggest that if WU had capitalized contract costs consistent with its 
historical average, it would have actually missed Q2 2015 EPS estimates by 2%, all else equal. This isn’t 
too much of a surprise given how sharply C2C fundamentals deteriorated in the most recent quarter.
18 
 


 
 
With little explanation, WU’s tax rate has perpetually declined over the years: 
 


 Guidance of 25% tax rate for 2011,
25





 Guidance of 16% tax rate for 2012
26





 Guidance of 15% for 2013
27


 and 2014
28





 Guidance of 13% for 2015.
29


 
 
We are hard-pressed to find many companies with such low tax rates. By comparison, Euronet 
Worldwide (EEFT.NASDAQ), the owner of the Ria, reports annual tax rates of 25% or more.


30
  


 
In the most recent quarter, WU reported a tax rate of 8.5% (11.8% normalized), which is already lower 
than the 13% tax rate it initially guided for 2015, and further helped the Company beat Q2 estimates. 
 
Unfortunately, WU provides little information to justify its tax rates. For example, on the Q4 2014 
conference call, when an analyst asked how the Company managed a 6% tax rate in the quarter, the CFO 
responded: “I won’t get into the details of which specific items drove our tax rate down in the fourth 
quarter.”


31
 Perhaps one day WU will realize that it’s a publicly-traded company and disclosing how taxes 


affect shareholder earnings comes with the territory. 
 
Responding to its low tax rates more broadly, Management stated that they were the result of operating 
“in very low tax jurisdictions” and “ongoing tax planning.”


32
 The ‘ongoing tax planning’ statement 


doesn’t really say anything, but we find the ‘low tax jurisdiction’ justification questionable. 
 
Among the top ten remitter and receiver countries that we analyzed, the weighted average corporate 
tax rate was 29%. These countries represent nearly half of all global remittance activity:

For WU’s 13-15% tax rates to balance, this would mean the jurisdictions that account for the other half 
of all global remittance activity have tax rates near zero. But according to an online tax list, very few 
jurisdictions have such low tax rates, and WU admits that no jurisdiction outside the US accounts for 
more than 6% of its revenue.


33
 


 
The alternative would be to assume that WU is using some sort of tax loopholes such as inversions or 
transfer pricing. 
 
Often drug companies report tax rates comparable to WU. These tax rates are generally the result of 
inversion transactions where the drug company transfers intellectual property, such as patents, to low 
tax jurisdictions, and then charges the operating subsidiaries in high tax jurisdictions royalties on the IP. 
This shifts earnings to the low tax jurisdiction and reduces taxes.  
 
Alternatively, transfer pricing can be used where goods are transferred from high tax jurisdictions subs 
to subs in low tax jurisdictions and then sold in order to shift income. 
 
However, according to one tax expert, WU does not seem to have the underlying business model 
associated with these type of strategies. A read of the Company’s revenue recognition policy does not 
suggest the ability to manage revenue, and the primary costs incurred by WU are agent commissions 
which don’t lend themselves to selective allocation.

Without access to its books it’s impossible for us to know how WU can report such low tax rates, but it 
seems that even the Company itself is confused by its own tax strategies. From the most recent 10-K 
filing: 
 


“As of December 31, 2014, no provision has been made for United States 
federal and state income taxes on certain of the Company's outside tax basis 
differences, which primarily relate to accumulated foreign earnings of 
approximately $5.6 billion... Such taxes could be significant. Determination of 
this amount of unrecognized United States deferred tax liability is not 
practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical 
calculation.”


34
 


 
 
That’s not very inspiring. 
 
 


Tax Strategies and the Coming Backlash 
 
There is growing discontent over tax minimization strategies, which have become a hot topic for 
countries the world over. In Europe, numerous governments are strapped for cash while much of the 
rest of the world, countries that relied on the commodities boom are seeing large holes in their budgets.  
 
Companies like WU, which are already viewed by many as preying on the poor,


35
 do business in all these 


countries, yet appear to pay little, if any taxes. There is an argument that governments should look the 
other way if these companies create jobs. In a recently penned letter to the US Senate, Carl Icahn noted 
that repatriation of foreign profits to the US will help with job creation.


36
 


 
Icahn was likely not referring to WU. WU operates in more than 200 countries, but has only 10,000 
employees worldwide.


37
 By contrast, GM employs 15,000 workers in Mexico alone.


38
 WU’s business 


model is predicated on agents who run their own unrelated business irrespective of WU. To call WU a 
job creator is to stretch the definition.  
 
The low taxes WU pays on its large profits are an affront to governments everywhere. And all it will take 
is for one fed-up country to make some noise before every other country start looking at how much WU 
pays in taxes vs how much it benefits from operating in that country. If anything, the case of Valeant is a 
sobering reminder of the problems that can quickly spawn when corporate practices are seen as 
exploitive and unfair.

We see WU as a deteriorating business that becomes more obsolete with each passing year. 
Furthermore, we believe a combination of capitalized costs and unsustainably low tax rates helped WU 
beat estimates in the most recent quarter, and we are highly dubious of a company that almost never 
misses earnings estimates. 
 
From a public policy perspective, we take issue with WU’s low tax rates, and believe they face severe 
headline risk. 
 
Given the fundamentals of the business, we believe another price cut similar to 2012 is imminent. The 
last time WU announced aggressive price cuts, the shares responded by correcting down 30%. 
Accordingly, we believe another correction is in the offing.
