Reasons We Are Short Greif Inc. (GEF)


In addition to market weakness, GEF struggles from a leveraged acquisition spree where it acquired 40 companies 


for $1.2 billion. GEF appears to be obfuscating its financial performance including 1) Reducing disclosures on 


segment price/volume trends 2) Distorting and confusing presentation of its EBITDA, and 3) Using gimmicks such 


as adding in sale of business units and timber sales to inflate operating cash flow. We believe all of these 


measures are intended for one purpose: minimize the appearance that its annual dividend is at risk of being cut or 


eliminated. Using our traditional measure of free cash flow, we believe GEF has done a terrible job of historically 


covering its dividend, and is at extreme risk of having to cut or eliminate it (its credit facility contains a Restricted 


Payment Leverage Ratio condition at 3.0x (currently at 2.5x)). A large shareholder has pledged 1.5 million Class B 


shares as collateral for a loan; a share price decline caused by a dividend cut could cause an adverse outcome  


GEF has had accounting issues and material weaknesses. Its auditor E&Y resigned in 2014 (previous auditor PWC 


was dismissed in 1999) and its 10-K filing was delayed. Deloitte was appointed as the new auditor, doubled E&Y’s 


audit fee, and upon recent filing of its 10-K, still could not attest that GEF had maintained adequate effective internal 


control over financial reporting 


GEF is trying to convince analysts/investors it can execute a turnaround. However, history shows that it has 


repeatedly failed to hit any of its financial objectives. Its dual class share structure, and egregious managerial comp 


schemes geared toward cash compensation (no stock options), disadvantage future wealth creation for Class A 


shareholders. Class B (voting) insiders have reduced ownership from 59% in 2008 to just 14% today. Meanwhile, 


senior executives are slowly jumping ship as indicated in year-end 8-K filings


Greif (GEF) is in the business of industrial packaging products and services. Its businesses appear largely 


commoditized, are capex intensive, and under severe pressure from FX headwinds ( Venezuela, Brazil, Russia, 


Europe)  and slackening demand tied to pressures in various end markets ( e.g. energy ). Overall, the company is 


experiencing deflationary-like pricing power and very low single digit / declining volumes 


We believe sell-side analysts are still giving GEF too much credit for sales and earnings growth in 2015/2016, which 


make the stock look cheap on current valuation metrics, but are at risk of further deterioration. There is only one 


“Sell” rating on GEF, although we applaud analysts for recently questioning management on the sustainability of its 


dividend, and for getting agitated with management’s inability to execute

Source: SEC Filings
(1) Between 2011 and 2012 10-K filings, GEF significantly changed its operating profit contribution to its financial statements for its 2011 reported acquisitions
(2) In its 2012 10-K filing, GEF increased its purchase price for its 2010 acquisitions by $98 million. It appears GEF tried to claim that $98.2 million received from its Flexible Packaging JV partner 
relating to their investment in the Flexible Packaging could be netted against acquisition costs. We view this as a misleading presentation of its financials


GEF has acquired 40 companies since 2007 and spent $1.2 billion. Given an average transaction size of ~$30m, it has 


provided limited SEC disclosure to investors (few press releases, or names of the companies) about what they’ve actually 


purchased! Over 82% of the acquisition costs have been allocated to goodwill and intangibles. In 2014, GEF acquired two 


more companies and stopped disclosing full year revenue or operating profit contributions to its financials.

In accordance with ASU 2010-29, “Disclosure of Supplementary Pro Forma Information for Business Combinations,” the 


Company has considered the effect of the 2012 and 2011 acquisitions in the consolidated statements of operations for 


each period presented. The revenue and operating profit of the 2011 acquisitions included in the Company’s consolidated 


results totaled $427.7 million and $4.0 million for the year ended October 31, 2012. The revenue and operating (loss) of 


the 2011 acquisitions included in the Company’s consolidated results totaled $119.2 million and ($19.6) million for the year 


ended October 31, 2011. None of the 2011 acquisitions were of companies listed on a stock exchange or otherwise 


publicly traded or required to provide public financial information. Therefore, pro forma results of operations are not 


presented.

GEF Balance Sheet May Become Stressed


11


Having fueled its acquisition binge with debt, GEF’s balance sheet is in a more precarious position in this 
stage of the economic cycle. Even more concerning, GEF books ~55% of its sales in foreign markets, and is 


meaningfully exposed to a stronger US$. In volatile and deteriorating markets such as Russia, Brazil, and 
Turkey, GEF has a total of 22 operating locations


Note: In its recent 10-k filing, GEF added a new risk factor warning it has a significant amount of goodwill, and if impaired in the future, would 
adversely impact its financial results of operations

Warning: GEF Becoming Less Transparent on 


Segment Revenue Trends (Volume/Pricing)


12


GEF used to provide more transparency into the quarterly volume and pricing trends for its three operating 
segments. This appendix enabled investors to more clearly track the quarterly progression for critical 


determinants of its sale performance. Since 2014, GEF has been less open about segment performance 
trends. As of Q4’14 earnings, volumes and pricing are flat to down in all of GEF’s segments, with Flexible 


Products experiencing volume declines of 9%

forward is approximately double what Ernst & Young charged prior to resigning in July 2014. Greif’s 


investors absorbed the cost of almost $13 million in audit and professional fees – a whopping $0.27 


per share!

Warning: Dividend Projection Omitted;


GEF Has Barely Ever Covered its Dividend


Buried in its Investor Day Appendix Presentation, GEF Intentionally Left Blank Its 2015

Warning: GEF’s Credit Facility Has 


Provisions Which Could Restrict Dividends


It’s important to read GEF’s credit 
facility carefully to understand the 


implications of its continued ability to 
pay dividends. Our interpretation in this 


case, is that GEF’s Leverage Ratio 
(Debt/EBITDA) needs to be monitored 


carefully. GEF believes its Leverage 
Ratio will be 2.5x in 2015 (Based on 


$430m of EBITDA (assuming its EBITDA 
is accurately stated and no debt 


reduction occurs). If EBITDA 
approaches $370m, its Leverage Ratio 


will be pressured at 3.0x  


Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company may pay 


Dividends of up to the lesser of (I) $0.01 per share of Class A 


Common Stock for each four consecutive Fiscal Quarters and 


(II) $250,000 for each consecutive Fiscal Quarter, and the 


Company may pay Dividends within 60 days after the date of 


declaration thereof if at such date of declaration such 


Dividend would have complied with 


this Section 7.05; provided that such Dividend if permitted 


only by Section 7.05(a) shall be included (without 


duplication) in the calculation of the amount of Restricted 


Payment for purpose of Section 7.05(a); and (y) the 


Company may pay Dividends and make other Restricted 


Payments not otherwise permitted under this Agreement if 


(I) no Default or Event of Default is existing or would result 


therefrom and (II) the Leverage Ratio, immediately after 


giving pro forma effect to any such Dividend or 


Restricted Payment, shall be less than 3:00:1).

Warning: A Large Block of Shares Have 


Been Pledged As Security For a Loan


Source: Proxy Statement Filed Jan 2015 (here)  and Jan 2011 (here)


A large block of Class B shares have been pledged as security for a bank loan. While the exact 
details of the pledge agreement are not publicly known, we believe the share pledge occurred 


sometime in the 2010-2011 time period based on its first public disclosure in GEF’s Proxy 
Statement filed Jan 2011.

Management Comp is Immune 


to GEF’s Financial Struggles


CEO’s Total Comp Has 
Doubled in a Period Where 


GEF’s Financial Performance 
Has Deteriorated. When GEF 
Talks About Opportunities to 
Reduce SG&A Expenses, Are 
Mgmt’s Salaries Considered?


Non-Equity Incentives are 
Short and Long-Term Cash 


Bonuses. The Goals to 
Achieve These Astronomical 
Pay Packages Appear to Be 


Getting Easier 


GEF Uses No Stock Options to 
Incentive Management for 
Long-Term Performance! 


Companies That Are Bullish on 
Their Future Love Getting 


Stock Options (Levered Bets on 
its Success.)..Not GEF’s Mgmt!

Here’s Why Voting Matters: Mgmt’s Long-


Term Compensation is Troubling....


Confidentiality — The Company’s EBITDA performance goals, used in the Long Term Incentive Plan for each of the three 


year periods ending in fiscal year 2015, 2016 and 2017, the Class A Common Stock target price performance goals used in 


the Two Year Plan (see “Two-Year Reinvigorated Incentive Plan” below) and the EMEA/APAC RONA performance goals for 


fiscal year 2015 are not included in this Compensation Discussion and Analysis section because the Company believes that 


disclosure of this information would cause the Company substantial competitive harm


Management is No Longer Being Held 
Accountable for Operating Cash Flow –


a Critical Determinant of the 
Sustainability of its Dividend


Given Our Numerous Concerns About 
GEF’s EBITDA Quality, It’s Troubling 


Mgmt is Now Being Rewarded Based On 
This Figure


GEF does not disclose the EBITDA goals management must obtain for its Long-Term bonus. We believe 
it’s incredibly odd that GEF offers EBITDA guidance to investors, but could be allowing management to be 


paid even if these targets are missed!

Another Company 


That Uses RONA as a 
Corporate Goal For 


Short-Term Bonuses?


GEF Does Not Even

Nevertheless, the 
Progression of GEF’s 
Corporate RONA tells 


a Very Disturbing 
Story, Yet its Mgmt is 
Still Getting a Healthy 


Payout for Dismal 
Performance!

Mgmt’s Short-Term Bonus Appears 


To Be A Block Box


Source: 2014 Proxy filed 1/28/15 (here); 
Certified RONA’s provided in proxy statements


“Consistent with prior years, the Short Term Incentive Plan’s 2014 fiscal 
year financial performance goals were based, and its 2015 fiscal year 
financial performance measures are based, upon the achievement of 
targeted measures of return on net assets (“RONA”), subject to such 
adjustments that the Special Subcommittee determines to be necessary 
to reflect accurately the RONA of the Company and/or one or more 
operating groups of the Company on the award date. The Special 
Subcommittee originally chose RONA as the measure for the Short Term 
Incentive Plan because it believed this metric to be the best measure of 
current profitability supporting growth”

We Applaud Analysts’ For Finally Pushing 


Back On GEF’s Management!


Steven Chercover:  D.A. Davidson Companies


“I wanted to start with Slide 18 cash flow items. Not to sound aggressive but isn’t it a bit 


misleading to say that free cash flow was up from $130 to $204, because if you strip out the 


sales it’s more like it’s going from $126 to $109 year-over-year?”


“With capex higher in 2015 than normal, how do you feel about the dividend and its safety?”


“With all due respect it’s getting harder and harder to get on your conference calls let alone 


attend the analyst day with the changes in the reporting date or the limited advanced notice of 


these events so I do hope going forward one of your objectives is to stabilize this whole 


reporting process so we have a date and stick to it.”


George Staphos - Bank of America


“Just as a comment here, I would encourage you perhaps for subsequent calls to not limit the 


amount of time on a call. In this day and age where we need to have public discussion with 


management in a widely disseminated forum it’s better to have our Q&A live mic as opposed to 


passing back and forth commentary through questions and notes. So, just as an aside take that 


into consideration at your leisure.”
