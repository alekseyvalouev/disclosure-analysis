QUESTIONS TO NOBLE GROUP’S
MANAGEMENT FOR THE Q1 2018
CONF CALL


May 15, 2018  � by Iceberg Research  � in Uncategorized  � 1 Comment  


Here are our questions to Noble’s management before its Q1 2018


conference call.


1) Noble’s chairman, Paul Brough, and its founder, Richard Elman, believe


that the “new Noble” post restructuring will be more successful than the


“old Noble”, now insolvent. However, the new Noble looks a lot like the old


Noble: same management, same director (Elman), about the same financing


costs. Noble will continue to suffer from a lack of financing lines: the


$700m contemplated trade line is not a financing facility, but a letter of


credit facility. How can the new Noble be more successful than the old Noble


if they fundamentally are the same company?


2) Banks had to recognise heavy provisions because of Noble. Does


management think the credit committees of these banks will accept


financing the new Noble if the same executives remain in place? How can


Noble survive and succeed as a commodity trader without these lines?


3) The most controversial aspect of the restructuring plan is the legal


release. This clause would release Nobles’ managers and directors from


claims of fraud or malfeasance. Not a single time, Noble has publicly


explained why this clause is justified. What benefit does this clause bring to


Noble’s stakeholders? How does it contribute to the financial restructuring


of Noble? Does management fear lawsuits from existing or past securities


holders who have suffered economic loss?


4) Most of bonds interest won’t be paid in cash, but “paid in kind” or “paid if


you can”. Does this mean that management already expects that the new

For number 6, you should counter sue them for damages and


block their restructuring unless they settle. Yet I believe yhey will


probably declare bankruptcy before paying iceberg a cent


because you revealed their gig.

Noble won’t be able to pay interest? If Noble is unable to pay interest, will


there be any cash left for shareholders and perpetuals holders? What does it


mean for the value of these securities?


5) The ad hoc group is made of hedge funds that are known for buying debt


of distressed companies at a cheap price and restructure this debt in a way


that strongly favours them. All the restructuring specialists we talked to


expect these funds to sell their exposure to the new Noble as soon as possible


after the restructuring is completed. Does it mean that the price of Noble’s


securities will fall even more?


6) Noble is still engaged in a lawsuit against us that they have not yet


dropped. As everybody knows, Noble has zero chance of winning this


lawsuit: all our arguments have been confirmed in their own financial


statements. We were informed by our lawyers that any restructuring that


would thwart or hinder our ability to recover our legal costs by transferring


assets to a new entity would be potentially void and reversible under section


60 of the Conveyancing and Property ordinance. In other words, we at


Iceberg can reverse the restructuring plan proposed by Noble. Did Noble’s


management inform its stakeholders of this quite ironic situation?
