Fellow Financial Detective Muddy Waters has conducted extensive research on NQ
Mobile Inc. (NQ) that indicates to them that NQ is a "massive fraud" that they believe is
worth "zero". In the 7 reports they have published on their website they allege with
significant detail that the cash balances are "highly likely to be not real" and bizarrely
auditor PWC even classifies NQ's cash as a Level 2 asset (slightly hard to value) in the
2012 audited financials.


In response, NQ organized a special committee in October 2013 to investigate the fraud
allegations which is set to report its findings tomorrow May 15th, which is the same date
that NQ's audited financials are required to be filed with the SEC after they filed a 15 day
extension on April 30 (the un-extended due date).


New Law Enforcement Investigation Per SEC FOIA Request


I have shocking NEW information: Per a SEC Freedom of Information Act Request - there
is an ongoing Law Enforcement Investigation into NQ now as well!


Muddy Waters has criticized that the Special Committee isn't truly independent and even
offered to pay for an independent accounting firm to evaluate the credibility of the
investigation. Now it looks like there is a truly independent party that works for the US
Government here to investigate as well!


I highlight the specific relevant language out of the FOIA document:


"We are withholding records responsive to your request under 5 U.S.C. 552 (B) (7)
(A), 17 CFR 200.80 (7) (I). This exemption protects from disclosure records
compiled for law enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be
expected to interfere with law enforcement activities."


From the Department of Justice Guide to the Freedom of Information Act:


"The first subpart of Exemption 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, Exemption 7,
authorizes the withholding of 'records or information compiled for law enforcement
purposes, but only to the extent that production of such law enforcement records or
information . . . could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement
proceedings.'"


THIS IS IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT A LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATION
INTO NQ MOBILE IS CURRENTLY UNDER WAY

Will NQ Mobile be shut down? Could the equity prove entirely worthless?


How Have Chinese Fraud Companies Played Out in the Past? A history lesson


Dozens of fraudulent Chinese companies have disappeared from the market since 2010.
Some did not receive detailed scrutiny from financial detectives and short sellers but had
their results fade away after they had collected their money and taken it to China and
simply ceased filing financials on time.


The most explosive blow ups of Chinese frauds, mostly in 2011 would play out as follows:


The day audits were normally due, an extension would be filed granting 15 extra days
April 1 there would be a filing that the auditor had been unable to file an unqualified
opinion or resigned and the stock would be halted
The NYSE/Nasdaq would ask for clarification and after several months passed
The stock would be delisted to the pink-sheets, down ~80% from the last closing price


This played out particularly with China MediaExpress (OTCPK:CCME) and Longtop
Financial (LTF) which:


Had Big 4 auditors (Deloitte in both these cases)
Fabricated the vast majority of their cash balances in China
Fabricated the vast majority of their revenue
Delisted and went to $0 months later
