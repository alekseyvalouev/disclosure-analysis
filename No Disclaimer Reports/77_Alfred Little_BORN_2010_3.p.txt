China New Borun: Investors Race to Exit as Concerns Mount

Following the resignation of four directors announced yesterday, China New Borun
(NYSE: BORN) private equity investors (Star Elite, Earnstar and TDR) are now racing to
sell their holdings (see table below). On December 10  the 180 day lock-up agreement
they signed expires, allowing them to sell up to 5,152,189 shares at any time.


Additionally, the expiration of the lock-up allows the 14,847,811 shares held by Chairman
Jinmiao Wang’s mother Mrs. Shan Junqin to also be sold. Both Mrs. Shan’s and Star
Elite’s share sales require disclosures to be filed upon any sale and are subject to volume
restrictions.


However, Earnstar and TDR will be free to sell their combined holdings of 1,440,237 or
5.6% of the outstanding shares without restriction in the open market and with no filing
requirements since they each hold under 5% and their Director appointees resigned last
week according to BORN’s press release yesterday (available here). Two additional
executive directors (the COO and Controller) also resigned while retaining their
management roles, reducing the total number of directors from 9 to 5.


The remaining board now consists of two executive directors and three independent
directors, meeting the minimum requirement for a majority independent board according to
the NYSE.


According to Borun’s Shareholders Agreement (available here), the directors representing
the private equity investors each have the right to serve until the next Annual General
Meeting which would occur after the 2010 audited financials are filed on Form 20-F, most
likely next March. These investors also each have the right to nominate at least one
director to serve on Borun’s board for the next term. So BORN’s sudden, unexpected and
unplanned announcement that Earnstar and TDR’s appointed directors resigned is a clear
sign that these investors plan to imminently sell their shares.
