Bio-Reference: A Scary Review of Its Own Genetic Test


by Melissa Davis - 6/4/2014 9:48:24 AM


No wonder Bio-Reference Laboratories (Nasdaq: BRLI) has found itself waiting months for health insurers to
review – and, in many cases, ultimately reject – big-ticket claims for its lucrative specialty tests.


Take a look at InheriGen, the flagship panel sold by the company’s booming genetics division, for a rather obvious
clue. A $3,600 screening tool packed with tests for all sorts of wildly obscure inherited disorders – far exceeding t


e handful recommended for the sound practice of medicine – InheriGen literally costs so much that it can easily
double, if not triple, the normal cost for comprehensive prenatal care. Even GenPap, the notoriously elaborate --
and expensive -- panel aggressively marketed by the company’s gigantic women’s health division – looks somewhat
modest in comparison, despite all of the controversy surrounding that glorified Pap smear.


“The reason why Bio-Reference can get away with this,” explained one of several former sales representative who
volunteered similar stories, “is because the company trains you to routinely say, ‘There is no risk to the doctor or
the patient. If the insurance company doesn’t pay, we’ll reduce the bill.’


“Some reps would receive up to 15 calls a day from patients upset about getting stuck with a $2,000 bill for
GenPap, when they just wanted a regular Pap smear. We dealt with complaints like that every day. It was our job to
take those calls and reduce the bill to $195 (a price resembling those charged for more traditional Pap smears.) If a
patient sounded really angry – and we felt worried that they might report us – we could zero out the entire balance
…


“Then Bio-Reference would just write it off. They wrote off a lot of business when I was there.”  


That sort of business strikes many doctors -- including a prominent member of the National Physicians Alliance --
as a pointless, if not dangerous, waste of precious resources in the first place. Even before former NPA president
Dr. Cheryl Bettigole learned that Bio-Reference commands thousands of dollars for its popular Inherigen and
GenPap tests, she felt compelled to sound a loud alarm in The New England Journal of Medicine about expensive
screening tools that look almost cheap in comparison. So Dr. Bettigole likely meant business when she responded
to that jarring discovery with plans to approach NPA policymakers about taking a public stand against the even
pricier screening panels that Bio-Reference has successfully pitched to so many oblivious physicians as
phenomenal deals.


“It’s demonically brilliant,” Dr. Bettigole bluntly declared upon hearing the crafty sales pitch relayed to
TheStreetSweeper by former Bio-Reference insiders once forced to use that deceptive marketing strategy
themselves. “I would like to send information about these tests to our policy committee. This is exactly the kind of
issue that the NPA looks at …


“We have an OB/GYN (obstetrician/gynecologist) on our committee,” Dr. Bettigole further volunteered. “ACOG,
the American Congress of Obstetrics and Gynecology, is wonderfully productive,” too.


Talk about a possible disaster.


As a lab that depends heavily (if not entirely) on brisk sales of big-ticket screening panels to fuel its outsized
growth, Bio-Reference can hardly afford for an influential medical society to publicly denounce the flagship panels
marketed by the very specialty divisions responsible for so much of its remarkable success. With health insurers
already intensifying their scrutiny of its lucrative specialty tests, a trend vividly illustrated by the recent surge in its
days sales outstanding (DSOs) and its bad-debt expense, Bio-Reference better hope that it can avoid pesky
interference from powerful – and increasingly cost-conscious – medical societies that often play a vital role in
shaping coverage decisions.


For now, at least, Bio-Reference continues to display unwavering confidence in its future prospects. Don’t forget
what happened the last time that Bio-Reference chose to casually ignore – and then boldly downplay – legitimate
threats that struck TheStreetSweeper as rather obvious, though. After riding an overheated rally all the way to a
record-breaking high, with its stock literally reaching its peak one day earlier, Bio-Reference issued a rare profit
warning that largely blamed the same issues previously dismissed by management for a massive shortfall that
brutally punished its highflying shares.


Sinking even lower in the six months that have since followed, Bio-Reference never recovered that devastating hit.

5/22/2018 TheStreetSweeper - Bio-Reference A Scary Review of Its Own Genetic Test


http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance/Bio_Reference__A_Scary_Review_of_Its_Own_Genetic_Test 2/7


Feel free to take Bio-Reference at its word yet again. That’s fine; hold onto that stock stock, regardless of its
vulnerabilities, at your own risk. At least try to arrive at an informed decision, however, by comparing the sunny
outlook presented by management with all of the brewing storms that its bright forecast manages to conveniently
ignore.


As the following evidence clearly demonstrates, Bio-Reference has placed a rather staggering bet on the genetics
division responsible for controversial panels like InheriGen – a test inexplicably designed to identify dozens of
ultra-rare disorders that TheStreetSweeper has laboriously catalogued, in rather stunning detail, for the entire
world to now see – despite a swelling list of dangers that keep raising the odds against the controversial laboratory.


Bio-Reference did not respond to questions for this story.





Bright Outlook: “We are now set on February as a planned release date for our disruptive new pan-ethnic carrier
screening test, Inherigen, which will be the flagship product upon which we will be basing our national entry into
this market … Another lab might see this as a billing opportunity. We don’t. We won’t. Our way to grow must be to
provide more for less and thereby gain market share. (That) market is considerable, especially when one looks at
the pan-ethnic carrier screens, because in something like that, you’re not just limited to maternal-fetal medicine or
to high-risk OB/GYNs – but virtually any OB/GYN.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, December 2011


Dark Cloud: “The utility of (genetic) testing depends on the predictive ability of the test, the likelihood of
actionable test results and the options available for the reduction of risks … Empirical studies so far have shown
that the predictive ability for most complex diseases is still moderate at best, which is for a large part explained by
the relatively limited number of low-risk variants that have been discovered so far. But even if all genetic variants
were discovered in the future, still the predictive ability would be restricted by the fact that complex diseases are
only partially heritable … Even though the benefits of testing may be higher when more diseases are tested for, the
likelihood of having at least some benefit may still be quantitatively low.” – Investigative Genetics, January 2010





Bright Outlook: “InheriGen tests for over 160 disorders inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (some X-
linked) that are mostly severe, childhood-onset diseases. It includes mutations chosen based on current ACMG
(American College of Medical Genetics) and ACOG (American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)
recommendations, as well as hundreds of mutations selected through careful review of scientific literature and
evaluation of clinical utility … InheriGen helps determine carrier risk for disorders that can be managed through
lifestyle changes during pregnancy, medical intervention in utero or at birth, or through other therapeutic
approaches. For some disorders, treatment may significantly reduce or eliminate the effects of the condition.” –
Bio-Reference press release, February 2012 (identical description currently published on the corporate website)


Dark Cloud: “Preconception and prenatal genetic screening and testing are recommended for a limited number
of severe child-onset diseases … In fact, genetic screening for any clinical purpose should be tied to the availability
of intervention, including prenatal diagnosis, counseling, reproductive decision making, lifestyle changes and
enhanced phenotype screening … The obstetrician/gynecologist who orders genetic tests should be aware of when
it is appropriate to test, which particular test to order and ‘what information the test can provide, the limitations of
the test, how to interpret positive and negative results in light of the patient’s medical or family history and the
medical management options available.’” – American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, formal
guidelines designed to address “ethical issues” related to genetic testing, June 2008





Bright Outlook: “We have introduced new programs, such as … Inherigen, which will propel us through a
changing reimbursement environment. We have designed marketing programs and comprehensive support
solutions that, we believe, have protected our franchises and enabled us to maintain our growth.” – Bio-Reference
CEO Marc Grodman, February 2013


Dark Cloud: “Although ECS (expanded carrier screening) panels may include conditions that are routinely
assessed in carrier testing, these ECS panels include many conditions that are not routinely evaluated and for
which there are no existing professional guidelines … If there is no family history of or ethnic predilection for a
disease, carrier screening is not recommended if the carrier rate is <1% in the general population. (Indeed),
population screening should only be performed if the disease prevalence is high and the morbidity of the disease is
high … BCBSNC (Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina) may request medical records for determination of
medical necessity. When medical records are requested, letters of support and/or explanation are often useful, but
are not sufficient documentation unless all specific information needed to make a medical necessity determination
is included.” – Blue Cross/Blue Shield of North Carolina, latest medical policy on prenatal genetic testing,
December 2013 (scheduled for an upcoming review in August of 2014)





Bright Outlook: “Our interest in GeneDx was a little bit different. Instead of saying, ‘I know you have a rare
disorder. Let me go test for it,’ my interest was, ‘What if you have a disorder that has a lot of different mutations
and you want to be able to go in and say which one is there?’ You can’t just go in and test, in sequence, one gene.
You need methodologies and platforms that can look at a lot of genes at one time. … People will say, ‘Wait a
minute. Why would you do tests for mutations when there are no drugs available for all the mutations? How do
you know what to do with this?’ Well, number one, it better be cost effective … It’s what we do for a number of
conditions, as well as in autism spectrum disorders, as well as in mitochondrial disorders, as well as in seizures,
new ones in neurology, new ones in prenatal genetic testing. All of these are outstanding new tests that we’re able
to do with a sales force of over 30 people nationwide who are selling this to specialists in those areas … It’s a major
source of growth for us.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, June 2013


Dark Cloud: “The proper selection of appropriate disease-causing targets for general population-based carrier
screening (i.e., absence of family history of the disorder) should be developed using clear criteria rather than
simply including as many disorders as possible … The basis for the selection of disorders on expanded carrier
screening panels should be disclosed. (Moreover), patient and provider materials must include specific citations
that support inclusion of the mutations for which screening is being performed … The information provided about
disorders with mild phenotypes, variable expression, low penetrance and/or characterized by an adult onset

should be complete and transparent, allowing patients to opt out of receiving these test results. (In addition), an
appropriately tailored informational pamphlet or Web site, containing a brief description of each disorder included
in a test panel, should be available to patients undergoing or considering an expanded prenatal/preconception
carrier screening panel … Laboratories have a duty to participate in and facilitate this information transfer.” –
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, position statement on prenatal/preconception expanded
carrier screening, April 2013





Bright Outlook: “Our performance in the third quarter was quite similar to the results we reported in the
immediately preceding second quarter – growth in all elements of our business, but especially strong in our
genetics area through GeneDx … The genetic franchise that has been constructed over the past decade by GeneDx
not only differentiates us further as an enterprise and is responsible for the fastest-growing part of our business,
but also has contributed significantly to our prospects of future success and innovation.” -- CEO Marc Grodman,
August 2013


Dark Cloud: “There appear to be two main factors which have caused increased concern on the part of the FDA:
the use of LDTs (laboratory-developed tests) in the exponentially growing field of molecular diagnostics, which
includes tests that are used to assess high-risk conditions and supply information for critical decision-making; and
the increasing number of LDTs being manufactured by corporations with publically traded assets and far-reaching
markets … Concerns about FDA direct regulation of LDTs are myriad. The FDA is not known for its fast action, and
thus submitting any test to it for approval is guaranteed to delay use of the test for an unforeseeable amount of
time. Submitting tests to the FDA for approval is also an expensive proposition … From a laboratory perspective,
(recent) draft guidance feels like the proverbial warning shot across the bow. It is a signal that the FDA will be
regulating LDTs and that it’s time for laboratorians to pay attention.” – Medical Laboratory Observer, October
2012


* Update: “Although the FDA has repeatedly expressed its intent to issue guidance on LDT regulation, significant
industry pushback and a politically divided government in Washington, D.C., has likely thwarted the agency’s
action in this regard. After a long period of silence, however, the FDA is once again talking about LDT regulation.”
– GenomeWeb, June 2013





Bright Outlook: “Regional Cancer Care Associates LLC (RCCA), one of the nation's largest oncology physician
groups, announced today it has partnered with GenPath Oncology, a business unit of Bio-Reference Laboratories,
to bring advanced diagnostics to the practice's more than 230,000 cancer patients … The first step in this multi-
year partnership is the development of a physician-owned immunophenotyping service for hematological
malignancies. In addition, GenPath will also be providing a significant amount of esoteric diagnostic testing to
RCCA's network of 92 oncology physicians in 27 locations. (GenPath) was selected from among the largest cancer
laboratories in the nation due to its scientific expertise and longstanding relationships with many of RCCA's
physicians.” – RCCA, joint press release, June 2013


Bright Outlook: “The OIG said that the arrangement ‘appears to permit (a lab) to do indirectly what it cannot do
directly – that is, to pay compensation to the referring physician in the form of the fee discount in exchange for
laboratory testing service referrals. The OIG said, ‘There appears to be no reason for (a lab) to pay the per-order
fees other than to secure referrals,’ and that such a fee structure ‘could potentially influence’ physician referrals ‘in
a material way.’” – Bloomberg article on the reversal of a favorable OIG opinion that had previously cleared the
way for labs to cover processing fees for physicians who directed business their way, April 2014





Bright Outlook: “We seized upon the opportunity to introduce our Inherited Cancers program to the market as
soon as possible and believe that our strong capabilities as a leading genetics laboratory with a significant franchise
in oncology and women’s health is a distinct advantage. As we have done in the past, we took on the expense of
accelerating our time to enter the market, despite the cost of doing so, because the market was available … There
were also substantial start-up costs related to the GeneDx inherited cancer program, which includes tests for the
BRCA genes; these expenses include substantial legal expenses associated with the roll-out and ongoing defense of
this program. The program was announced in late August, and the company has received highly favorable provider
response and indications of acceptance. Nonetheless, the program did not have time to meaningfully contribute to
Q4FY13 revenues, although the company anticipates this will be a strong program throughout FY2014.” – Bio-
Reference CEO Marc Grodman, November 2013


Dark Cloud: “We rely on participating practitioners to refer their Horizon BCBSNJ (Blue Cross/Blue Shield of
New Jersey) patients or forward their testing samples to participating clinical laboratories … LabCorp can perform
BRCA-related genetic testing. (Starting this summer), LabCorp will be the only participating clinical laboratory to
provide this important testing for your Horizon BCBSNJ patients.” – Horizon Blue Cross/Blue Shield of New
Jersey (the very state where BRLI last year forged a valuable partnership with a huge alliance of oncologists), May
2014





Bright Outlook: “We remain now – more than ever – a growth company, grounded in innovation. (Indeed), our
leadership and innovation in genetics has never been more apparent … We believe the opportunities to grow our
business have never been greater, (and) we further believe that the greatest single opportunity in laboratory
medicine is in the area of genetic testing. We introduced our Inherited Cancers program at the end of August, and
the greatest challenge we are currently facing is just simply handling the high demand for our products … We
believe our opportunities in this area over the next 12 or 18 months are outstanding.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc
Grodman, December 2013


Dark Cloud: “Genetic tests for cancer are only a covered benefit for a beneficiary with a personal history of an
illness, injury or sign/symptoms thereof (i.e. clinically affected). A person with a personal history of a relevant
cancer is a clinically affected person … Genetic testing is considered a non-covered screening test for patients
unaffected by a relevant illness, injury, or signs/symptoms thereof. Predictive or pre-symptomatic genetic tests
and services, in the absence of past or present illness in the beneficiary, are not covered under national Medicare
rules. For example, Medicare does not cover genetic tests based on family history alone. A covered genetic test

must be used to manage a patient. Medicare does not cover a genetic test for a clinically affected individual … when
the treatment and surveillance of the beneficiary will not be affected, or in any other circumstance that does not
directly affect the diagnosis or treatment of the beneficiary. – UnitedHealthcare, coverage policy for members
enrolled in its Medicare Advantage plans, April 2011





Bright Outlook: “Year over year, we saw an increase in volume at GeneDx of more than 70% … We will continue
to invest in GeneDx -- and expect to nearly double the number of GeneDx employees from September 2013 to the
end of FY 14 -- in order to meet the demand for our services … We know the bar we need to meet going forward.
(So) we’ve stepped up all efforts to feed the growth at GeneDx … It has been substantial. It’s not a small business
any more. Quite frankly, it’s quite the opposite. And we continue to go in and do that because we need to be able to
go and see the growth … These opportunities don’t come along very often. (So) when you have those opportunities,
you just need to lay the tracks to feed the growth. And that’s where we are now with genetics. So that’s not going to
stop.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, March 2014


Dark Cloud: “A review last year of clinical guidelines issued by 30 of the largest physician specialty societies
found that 17 of them explicitly integrated costs. (Moreover), in recent years, as part of a campaign called Choosing
Wisely, many medical societies have submitted lists of the top five procedures, tests or productions to be
questioned because they are considered wasteful … Traditionally, guidelines have heavily influenced the practice of
medicine, and the latest ones are expected to make doctors more conscious of the economic consequences of their
decisions, even though there is no obligation to follow them. Medical society guidelines are also used by insurance
companies to help determine reimbursement policies.” – The New York Times, April 2014





Bright Outlook: “I can’t talk about GeneDx without at least mentioning somewhat the opportunity of inherited
cancer. We’ve been doing single genes for years with a great reputation. We’ve been doing next-gen sequencing –
meaning panels – for six years, before anyone else. The opportunity in inherited cancer is significant. (But) I have
to tell you, these changes – and everyone talks about it and gets all concerned about it – don’t happen overnight …
We introduced our inherited cancer program, on a very small scale, in the fall. (Since then), we’ve increased our
capacity at GeneDx substantially … This has been an incredibly highly competitive area, and there are a lot of
laboratories that do the work … But the very fact, I believe, that we have the experience, the sales relationships and
the reputation in the name of GeneDX (help) create a very special opportunity for what we’re going to be able to
achieve.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, May 2014


Dark Cloud: “On Sept. 1, 2014, UnitedHealthcare will launch the Laboratory Benefit Management Program.
Beacon Laboratory Benefit Solutions, Inc. (BeaconLBS®), a subsidiary of LabCorp®, will administer this new
program to help improve quality of care and manage appropriate utilization for outpatient laboratory services …
All outpatient laboratory services for these members will be subject to new requirements including advance
notification and medical policies. As part of the program, ordering and rendering providers will use BeaconLBS
Physician Decision Support for laboratory services. BeaconLBS’ Physician Decision Support technology makes it
easier to choose the right tests and laboratories for members using evidence-based guidelines and industry best
practices … It also helps identify in-network laboratories that have the expertise to perform Decision Support
Tests. These tests require advance notification through Physician Decision Support, (which) will indicate if the
service meets UnitedHealthcare Medical Policy … If prior authorization was not requested (and/or) if notification
was not received, the claim will be denied as laboratory liability.” – UnitedHealthcare, notification to laboratories
and physicians, May 2014





Bright Outlook: “Reimbursements have come down for all of us. We announced it in the fall of last year; other
laboratories announced it as well. These are changes that we’ve dealt with, and it’s been hard on the entire
industry. The question is: How do you respond to it? Do you know how we respond to it? With growth. With
growth … We respond to that by going in and doubling down on the areas where we do better than anywhere else,
and by being able to grow the business … In the last year, we’ve increased our capacity at GeneDx, in terms of
people, by probably about 40%. In the first quarter, we announced that our testing increased quarter-over-quarter
by 70% … You can’t go in and be successful in offering one test. You can’t do it. It’s too hard. You’d need to go in
and do more. And we’ve set a standard in genetics, which all of us – who put our career on this – believe is
differentiating … This is a great opportunity for us in every which way.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, May
2014


Dark Cloud: “What do we not like? BRLI. CEO seemed v. bearish – more so because recent legislation favors
LH/DGX (LabCorp and Quest). Volumes seem ok but they are still having issues getting paid so we expect their
DSOs (days sales outstanding) to still be relatively inflated this quarter. These guys seem to be getting closer to
selling given what they view to be an unfavorable reimbursement environment.” – William Blair analyst Amanda
Murphy, research note issued after meeting with CEO Marc Grodman, May 2014





Further evidence of overlooked risks


Bright Outlook: “Management, department supervisors and members of the (quality assurance) committee
continually monitor laboratory quality … We believe that our high standards of quality are an important factor in
client retention.” Bio-Reference annual report, January 2014


Dark Cloud: “This is an action to recover damages and civil penalties on behalf of the United States of America
arising out of false claims approved and presented by (Bio-Reference) to obtain over approximately $30,000,000
annually from the United States through Medicare and Medicaid from at least 2007 and continuing to the present
… In seeking to provide this testing to Medicaid and Medicare patients, defendants have asserted that the GenPap
testing panel is 99% accurate in detecting certain yeast infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Independent
testing has demonstrated that GenPap is actually – at most – 80% accurate in detecting these conditions, resulting
in misdiagnosis and unnecessary retesting … Defendant made these statements – and continues to make these
statements of accuracy – despite its prior knowledge that the testing in question was actually only 80% accurate.
The defendant’s deception has resulted in the billing of Medicare and Medicaid for thousands of dollars of
ineffective tests, which were either inaccurate or were required to be redone using more conventional testing

methods … As a direct and proximate result of the defendant’s actions, the amount of damages sustained by the
United States of America is in excess of $100,000,000.” – Whistleblower lawsuit filed by former Bio-Reference
sales representative, August 2012





Bright Outlook: “The traditional role of laboratories is to provide lab services for (medical providers). But they
want to be in the business; they want to get the revenues. They want to do some of the lab work. So we have to go
in and partner with them … We just made an announcement the other day that there is a group in New Jersey of
90 oncologists that have merged together, (and) we signed an agreement – a partnership – with them. We’re
helping them set up a lab. They’re going to do some of the work; we’re going to do everything else.” – Bio-
Reference CEO Marc Grodman, June 2013


Dark Cloud: “BR has been getting away with murder for years, and the recent agreement with RCCA (Regional
Cancer Care Associates) is the most blatant violation of this law yet. All RCCA accounts will profit-share from
incoming flow tests, but Andrew P. (RCCA President Dr. Andrew Pecora) mandated that all tests must go to BR?
Just how much is AP getting paid from Marc G (Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman) for this arrangement?” “Tina
opened up a can of worms by going to RCCA accounts and telling them they had to start sending all lab work to
GenPath two months before the RCCA lab even opened. Her name was mentioned multiple times at ASCO
(American Society of Clinical Oncology), and her unethical approach in regards to the RCCA lab has left a bad taste
with most that we spoke to.” “This wasn’t just her idea. This was a coordinated effort by upper management to
secure all business from RCCA accounts under the guise of a seamless workflow. She and a manager were out in
the field delivering this message, saying it came from RCCA.” – Bio-Reference Sales Representatives, May/June
2013





Bright Outlook: “We have a natural advantage in women’s health. GenPath Women’s Health was the first
laboratory – the first one – that allowed a physician, off of a Pap smear, to look for trichomonas … for herpes, for
Mycoplasma genitalium. (Now), there is not a clinical laboratory that has not emulated what we’ve done … But our
product is different. And when we had this advantage, we built a sales force to go in and work with OB/GYNs – 150
(people) around the country … These components still allow us – in combination with good managed care
contracting and a specialized brand – to grow, actually grow, in women’s health.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc
Grodman, May 2014


Dark Cloud: “In the past year, I have been visited by multiple laboratory representatives touting ‘improved’ tests,
virtually all of which involve combination panels that can be easily ordered and that contain extensive lists of fairly
esoteric tests. The single-vial women’s health test is being heavily marketed by multiple laboratories. It includes
not only the Pap and HPV tests but also tests for multiple infections – including some we would rarely have tested
for in the past – for which we often have no evidence of benefit … Nothing at any point along the way alerts either
the clinician or the patient to the high costs of these tests or to the fact that there is little medical evidence to
suggest that they are useful for most patients … As healthcare costs grow and laboratories develop savvy marketing
tactics resembling those deployed by pharmaceutical companies, it is becoming increasingly clear that physicians
have an obligation to be good stewards of limited resources and to understand the financial effects that the orders
we write have on our patients … If we fail to do so, we risk not only our patients’ pocketbooks but also the gains we
have made against cervical cancer and many other conditions. We contribute to spiraling healthcare costs and are
doing real harm.” – “The Thousand-Dollar Pap Smear,” an article written by the immediate past president of the
National Physicians Alliance for The New England Journal of Medicine, October 2013


* Update: “The Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved the first alternative to the long-used Pap
test as a primary screening method for cervical cancer … The new test, developed by Roche, detects the DNA of the
human papilloma virus, which causes almost all cases of cervical cancer, in a sample taken from the cervix …
Roche’s Cobas HPV test and HPV tests sold by other companies have been used until now as a follow-up test to
help resolve ambiguous Pap results, or together with Pap testing as a primary screening tool. The new approval
would allow the HPV test to be used alone as an initial screen for women 25 and older. Pap testing would be used
only in certain cases as a follow-up test. Studies have shown that HPV testing can result in detection of more
precancerous lesions than Pap testing.” – The New York Times, April 2014

Bright Outlook: “We have seen recent changes that we believe will allow us to maintain our growth and .2
improve some of the financial metrics that have been under pressure from temporary conditions … This past
year has been tumultuous with regards to collections, given the changes that have been implemented. We
believe that we have been quite successful over the past few years in showing improvement in this area. The
current quarter is an exception to that trend, but we believe that the exception is coming under control and we
can expect to get back on track in the near-term future … We don’t give quarterly projections, (but) we have
done pretty well in the first two quarters of this year. We expect, given where we expect to be in the fourth
quarter, we still are certainly reaffirming the guidance of 15% (growth in sales) and 20% in net income.” –Bio-
Reference CEO Marc Grodman, August 2013


Dark Cloud: “While volume growth was impressive (especially given bad weather), trends in other metrics were
somewhat concerning … Gross margin has deteriorated the past two quarters, likely in part driven by continued
reimbursement pressure. (Meanwhile), the negative effect of weather in the first half of the year places even
greater pressure on the second half. (Indeed), guidance implies a more aggressive contribution in earnings from
the back half than we have seen from the company (steepest prior ramp up was in 2005). DSOs have increased
over the past few quarters (as well). Despite an increase in payables, cash flow generation has deteriorated;
consequentially, for the first time in a number of quarters, receivables are growing faster than revenue … Operating
cash flow was negative $2.7 million, representing the fifth quarterly decline, leaving $14 million of cash on the
balance sheet (the lowest level since 2009). We are encouraged by volume growth – especially within GeneDx –
and the company’s plan to double the number of employees dedicated to GeneDx, showing strong demand for
genetic testing. However, gross margin deterioration and DSO spike (from 92 to 111) are concerning to us … Thus,
we maintain our market perform rating” on the stock. – William Blair, March 2014





Bright Outlook: “Look, we pay for growth. It’s not rocket science. We spend 9.5% -- a lot – of sales on marketing
… We have over 300 salespeople. (And) when you build a sales force, you have to have a culture of growth.” Bio-

5/22/2018 TheStreetSweeper - Bio-Reference A Scary Review of Its Own Genetic Test


http://thestreetsweeper.org/undersurveillance/Bio_Reference__A_Scary_Review_of_Its_Own_Genetic_Test 6/7


Reference CEO Marc Grodman, June 2013


Dark Cloud: “Most of the good reps have left because of the cut in reimbursement and awful management … Def
agree abt ppl leaving bc of reduced reimbursement and poor management. That’s why I left also. (And) I do see ppl
leaving more in the future as commissions start dwindling.” Bio-Reference veterans, May 2014





Bright Outlook: “We have built up resources in Florida … and we expect to expand in a similar manner in
California, given our new acquisition in that state … These two acquisitions demonstrate who we are. They
demonstrate our position in the market. We not only possess the means to deliver and to offer state-of-the-art,
cutting-edge solutions, but we also realize we have to possess the means to deliver and profit from those.” Bio-
Reference CEO Marc Grodman, August 2013


Dark Cloud: “GenPath doesn’t have any HMO/IPO contracts in California, so your earning potential there is
nonexistent. The most recent sales awards ceremony clearly showed that the closer you are to New Jersey, the
better chance you have of hitting big numbers and actually making money. (The only people that won an award
were based on the East Coast.) I would say that, if you are anywhere near the West, stay away. (The) culture is
awful as well.” – Bio-Reference sales representative, August 2013


* Update: “Can anyone confirm if that tall GenPath rep in SoCal (southern California) left?” “Gone with the wind.
(Now), two more people have left the West” as well. – Bio-Reference sales representatives, September 2013





Bright Outlook: “We have a contract with – (or) we work with – Aetna. We work with Cigna. We work with
United. Not many national laboratories can (say they) have that kind of roster … We’re one of the few laboratories
that work all over the country with UnitedHealth, CIGNA, Aetna, Coventry. We have contracts with most the of the
Blues plans within the entire United States, and we have a contract with the Blue Cross/Blue Shield Association to
bring our pricing to them around the country. So that means we are competitive in most of the areas. It doesn’t
mean – and this is part of the issue we talked about – that we’re going to be in-network for every plan for every
Blue … But we’re in there competitively, virtually in most regions in the country and with most of the major plans.
(And) we’ve been able to work very hard in working with payers in this new reimbursement environment … We’ve
also responded by being able to go in and, we think, be able to find new ways to be able to streamline the process
because, in the future, doing specialty work in a cost-effective manner is a way that we see that we’re able to go in
and grow.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, May 2014





Dark Cloud: “I work in the GeneDx division, so I can only speak for our group. Basically, because we are out of
network with insurance companies, we can collect any amount that we want … We can write off balances and still
remain profitable. It’s a huge sales advantage and consistently works.” – GenPath sales representative, December
2011





Bright Outlook: “We are pleased to be able to offer Panorama (a test developed by marketing partner Natera) as
part of our full-service prenatal offering … With the recent guidelines published on non-invasive prenatal
screening by ACOG, it is clear that this is a beneficial service to women and their clinicians while facing high-risk
pregnancies.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, February 2013


Dark Cloud: “Natera is going back to accounts and ‘up-selling’ them on the microdeletions. It is uncertain
whether their agreement with us means we get the opportunity to include this or if we are left out in the cold.
While they are a partner, they are essentially taking business away from us to some degree, especially in the big
teaching facilities and university-supported hospital systems … The Natera reps are going back in and doing
everything they can to lock us out and take the accounts direct. It stopped being a partnership in December …
What a fucking joke! Partnership, my ass.” Bio-Reference Sales Representatives, Spring 2014





Bright Outlook: “We believe that ACT, our Advanced Cardiovascular Testing program, is a model for the way
clinical laboratories can provide added value for both physicians and patients … The NMR LipoProfile test,
developed by LipoScience, is a critical element in this outstanding report, and we are extremely pleased to be
working with LipoScience in this program.” – Bio-Reference CEO Marc Grodman, joint press release, August 2007


Dark Cloud: “Why is my Lipo rep being told by their manager to not partner with us any more? Anyone else
having this issue?” “Don’t we have a solid relationship? Or is something else in the works on their end?” “I am
having the same issue. We have had a close relationship and have worked very well together in the past. I
connected with them when HDL (Health Diagnostics Laboratory) dropped LS to plan how we could grow, and they
mentioned to me their manager was pushing them to grow in another direction.” “As a LipoScience rep, I will tell
you that my manager told me to work with LabCorp – and LabCorp only. He said, ‘BioRef, Boston Heart, and HDL
are the next labs to go down, so it’s best for the company to focus on growth within a national lab.’” – Bio-
Reference and LipoScience sales representatives, May 2014
