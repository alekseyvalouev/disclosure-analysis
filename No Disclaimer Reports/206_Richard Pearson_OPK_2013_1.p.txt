Dose Of Reality: Opko Set For A Pullback As Insider Selling Begins
Feb. 8, 2013 9:40 AM ET58 comments
by: Richard Pearson


Shares of Opko Health (NYSEMKT:OPK) have risen 65% in the past three months as a
string of domestic and international acquisitions, along with a greater collaboration with
Bristol Myers (NYSE:BMY), has opened up numerous new pathways for the company.


Opko's prospects as a company continue to be bright; however, at the current price of
around $7.00, the market cap of Opko now exceeds $2 billion.


This is in spite of the fact that Opko has recently disclosed that it does not expect to
become profitable in the near term, which implies that massive revenues (as predicted by
various authors) are not on the near-term horizon.


As shown on the Form 4s, insiders have now begun selling, with Opko's VP of Finance
and Chief Accounting Officer selling $336,000 of stock on February 1st.


Based on the information below, at any prices above $5.50, Opko is a clear sell. Although
at prices of $4.00-$5.00, the stock likely becomes an interesting buy once again.


Even those who are very bullish on Opko's long-term prospects are now leery of the
recent run-up and the lofty share price. Various signals are now emerging that the stock is
headed for a significant correction.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 2/30


The signals include the following:


Insider selling: According to the latest Form 4, on February 1st, Opko's VP of Finance
and Chief Accounting Officer, exercised his options and immediately sold 100% of the
shares underlying at $6.72. Total shares amounted to 50,000, resulting in proceeds of
$336,000.
Heavy share issuance by Opko: Opko has been taking advantage of the run-up in
the share price to issue 20 million shares for its acquisition of Cytochroma at $4.87
and another 25 million shares via a convertible bond at $7.07. These represents
issuance of over 45 million shares all in the month of January alone.
Negligible buying by Frost: Purchases from Dr. Frost have continued, but the vast
majority were in 2012 at prices of $4.00-$5.00. Only 70,000 shares were purchased
above $6.00. Dr. Frost's historical position is greater than 140 million shares.
Huge overhang from potential sellers: The recipients of shares from recent
acquisitions along with the convertible bond shares now create a massive overhang
of more than 50 million shares.


Author Kevin Quon has been bullish on the stock but also noted in his most recent article
that the market cap has become difficult to justify. The Motley Fool notes that Opko has
"received an alarming one-star ranking," meaning that it is expected to be a notable
underperformer. Author Josh Ginsberg continues to be bullish on Opko's business
prospects but notably made no evaluation of the share price following the run-up to $7.00
and $2 billion in market cap.


Clearly these comments do not reflect a lack of opportunities for Opko nor do they reflect
a lack of faith in Dr. Phillip Frost or Opko management. Just about anyone familiar with
Opko or Dr. Frost continues to be bullish on the long-term prospects for the company.


Instead bearish comments are a reflection on Opko's share price, which has simply moved
way too far way too fast and is now due for a meaningful pullback.


Back in November, Jim Cramer noted that the company was a "$4.00 and change" stock
but cautioned viewers


don't jump all over this thing because you will lose money if you chase it up to $5.00
or something silly like that.

That was just 10-12 weeks ago and now the stock is at $7.00. On his most recent show
featuring Opko, Cramer continued to be positive on the company's prospects but stopped
short of calling it a buy.


The reasons for his restraint are twofold.


First, the $2 billion valuation now creates far more chance of near-term downside than
further upside.


Second, according to Dr. Frost, Opko's prospects for drug revenues are looking likely to
be 2014-2015 events as opposed to 2013 events. Clinical trials for the various drugs will
be completed in late 2013 and in 2014, such that commercialization will occur about a
year after that, according to the interview.


While Cramer will be telling investors to not chase the stock up to $5.00, Bill Alpert at
Barron's was telling them to sell outright at $4.00. The scathing article from Barron's
stated that Opko was only worth $1.00-$2.00. Alpert cited medical journals which showed
that Opko's diagnostic tests were failing to detect Alzheimer's and prostate cancer as
planned. Alpert did acknowledge that Opko would likely be presenting investors with other
shots on goal in the future, noting:


With Frost's deep pockets and a dizzyingly diverse project portfolio, Opko will surely
have other stories to tell if these diagnostics don't fly. But prospective investors might
want to wait for the validation that comes with real fundamentals.


There are several misconceptions about Opko which are leading some investors to
continue bidding up the stock even at prices above $6.00.


The misconceptions are as follows:


Many investors are under the impression that Dr. Frost has been purchasing a large
volume of shares at over $6.00 when in fact his purchases have been negligible. The
benefit of these small purchases is more one of signaling to the market which has
caused the share price to continue to rise.
Revenue forecasts from bullish authors seem to have significantly overestimated the
revenue potential for Opko's drugs and its 4KScore product. For example, authors are
consistently predicting that expected revenues from numerous drugs will exceed
those of the best selling drugs of all time for the entire industry. With 4K, authors are
assuming the test will sell for triple the price and immediately capture 50% of the
market.

Many investors are pinning their hopes on a continued short squeeze, but the short
squeeze on Opko is now fading. The number of days to cover the short position has
fallen from 43 days to just 11 days. Short interest itself has fallen by 30%, such that
the covering shorts will no longer be supporting the share price and may now be re-
entering the trade as a new short.


In decades past, Dr. Frost enjoyed spectacular success in selling Key Pharmaceuticals
and Ivax Pharmaceuticals after they matured into substantial revenue generators.


But investors must keep in mind that his involvement with each of these companies lasted
well over 10 years before the companies were in a position to ultimately be sold.


Those who choose to sell Opko on this latest run-up to $7.00 may well have the
opportunity to buy back into the stock at prices back in the $4.00-$5.00 range, at which
time they can still make a longer-term bet if they are speculating on an ultimate sale of the
company by Dr. Frost in the years after revenues begin to materialize.


The Dr. Frost Effect


Many investors seem to believe that the purchases by Dr. Frost are so large that they
have pushed up the share price of Opko and caused a short squeeze. However, this is
demonstrably not the case.


Author Kevin Quon recently noted that:


As of January 11, Frost has effectively taken 135,764,800 shares off of the open
marketâ€¦ For a company that held a 17.7% short position of the outstanding float, or
24.26 million shorted shares as of December 31, such continual buying pressure
by the CEO has put a real pinch on those looking to profit from a decline in the
company's price.


Quon had separately noted that:


Despite having share prices climb nearly 50% in the last 3 months alone, Frost
continues to steadily buy large volumes of shares.


In reality, the volume of shares being purchased by Frost at above $5.00 has actually
been entirely negligible, as shown in the chart below. The data comes from the Form 4
filings to the SEC.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 5/30


The chart on the left shows the volume of shares purchased by Dr. Frost at each price
range over the past three months. This is the time period in which the share price has
skyrocketed. As we can see, almost all of Frost's purchases occurred at $4.00-$5.00.
There were some purchases even above $6.00, but the volume on these was tiny.


The chart on the right is a subset of the chart on the left and shows the exact prices and
volumes of each Dr. Frost's individual purchases in 2013. As we can see, there have only
been a few purchases and the largest one in 2013 so far has been only 50,000 shares.


As a result, it is clear that these purchases are not "large" and are not "pushing up the
price" of Opko by themselves. Opko typically trades around 3 million shares per day.


But obviously Frost's purchases do have a different effect that is distinct from the simple
aspect of supply and demand. The real effect here is one of signaling. As Frost
continues to buy, retail investors continue to take notice and jump on board with their own
buying.


Dr. Frost currently owns over 40% of Opko, with outside institutions owning only 16% of
the company. As a result, aside from Dr. Frost, the float is held almost entirely by retail
investors.


Investors who pile in at the $6.00-$7.00 level are missing out on the simple economics of
why this works for Frost in a way that doesn't work for anyone else. This may be one of
the reasons why institutional ownership continues to be quite low.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 6/30


Smaller investors need to realize that the result for Dr. Frost has been an increase in
ownership of only 0.2% during 2013. His position was already so large that the added
shares (even at higher prices) have virtually no impact on his overall cost or on the size of
his position.


Dr. Frost invested a mere 0.2% into new shares at higher prices but the signaling value of
this boosted the value of his existing 140 million shares by 40%. The economics of this
would be nearly identical even if Dr. Frost had purchased the shares at $10.00 or $20.00,
so it can be expected that his small purchases will continue for the foreseeable future.


Obviously, if the rest of us had the same effect from signaling, we would continue buying
small amounts of Opko as well.


If Dr. Frost isn't selling, then why does he care about the stock price ?


The first point that investors need to realize is that although Dr. Frost isn't selling shares,
Opko is selling frequently and in large size. Opko has already issued over 45 million
shares just in the month of January as a result of the Cytochroma acquisition and the
convertible bond.


Dr. Frost is using the greatly appreciated stock of Opko as a currency for going on his
shopping spree for new companies to acquire.


Prior to the recent interview of Dr. Frost on Cramer, the stock had been at $6.00, however
the Cramer effect quickly allowed Opko to issue shares under the convertible at $7.07.


The disadvantage of the convertible is that it requires $5.25 million per year in interest
payment by Opko, totaling $26.25 million in interest for the 5 years in which the bond is
not callable by Opko.


Dr. Frost knows that he will continue making acquisitions and he knows he will be issuing
much more stock to pay for them. But he is uncertain what the price of the stock will be in
coming months, so he was happy to lock in a $26 million interest obligation in exchange
for the certainty of issuing equity at $7.07.


As shown above, Dr. Frost made the vast majority of his purchases at prices below $5.00.
Only a mere 70,000 shares have been purchased at prices over $6.00. But the signaling
effect, along with some help from Cramer, has provided Dr. Frost and Opko with a higher
share price for issuing stock in financings and acquisitions.


Mr. Quon also seems to agree with this conclusion, stating that:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 7/30


By propping up the company's share price with his own insider purchases, Frost was
able to wield greater buying power in the latest acquisitions.


What is the right price to sell Opko stock?


Obviously the $7.07 conversion price of the convertible says that selling stock at $7.07 is
an attractive sale price in the eyes of Opko and Dr. Frost. This appears to be true even
though it required paying $26 million in interest.


Just three weeks ago, Opko agreed to acquire Cytochroma for an upfront price of $100
million. As in the past, Opko used its stock as currency with 20.5 million shares issuable in
lieu of the $100 million. This equates to a share price of $4.87. In addition, there may be
an additional payment of up to $190 million, which can also be paid stock if desired.


And now most recently the VP of Finance and Chief Accounting Officer sold 100% of his
recently vested options at a price of $6.70-$6.74.


So for those investors who have ridden the stock up, each of these can be viewed as a
signal from those who know best that the current level is a time to be selling rather than
buying the stock.


What are the recent acquisitions worth?


In December Opko closed its acquisition of Prost-Data Inc. (OURLab) based out of
Nashville. One week later Opko announced that it had acquired Silicon ComÃ©rcio of Brazil.
Within the span of just one month, Opko was already on its third deal with Canadian
Cytochroma in January.


All three deals do appear to bring significant potential to Opko in the future. But investors
do need to realize that doing three major acquisitions in three different countries in just
four weeks is a huge amount for any one company to chew on when it comes to
integration and implementation.


The current share price seems to reflect a view that completing the three deals on paper is
equivalent to having already made them work for shareholders. Investors will need to be
patient before expecting results from these recent acquisitions, no matter how exciting
they are.


In mustering up their patience, investors need to consider that over the past three years
Opko has now acquired companies in:

Mexico

Chile

Canada
Brazil
The United States.


Opko had acquired the rights to rolapitant for anti-nausea and vomiting from Schering
Plough (NYSE:MRK) in 2009.


Despite this blistering pace of acquisitions over a three year period, Opko has only just
broken through the $10 million mark for quarterly revenues in its most recent quarter.


Rolapitant has been in Opko's drug portfolio for nearly four years. So again, if these past
acquisitions are still works in progress, the most recent acquisitions can be expected to
take a few years before they begin to bear the results that investors are currently hoping
for.


At $11 million in Q3, revenue growth continues to be impressive relative to where it was in
the previous quarter. However, investors need to keep in mind that Opko is not growing
these revenues organically, but is instead buying these revenues, using its stock as a
currency.


In addition, many investors seem to forget that while each acquisition brings the potential
for new revenues, it also brings the certainty of immediate new expenses related to the
deal and all of the new employees that come with it.


Opko has made this point clear. In its most recent 10Q released in November, Opko
stated that:


We have a history of operating losses and we do not expect to become profitable
in the near future.


Clearly, if Opko were expecting even a single billion dollar product to hit the market any
time soon, it would be expecting an immediate swing to massive profitability. In its most
recent quarter, Opko's operating expenses totaled only $21 million against revenues of
$11 million. An extra billion dollar in expected revenue would obviously change that
equation.

In the past, Dr. Frost demonstrated his long-term focus and extreme patience. Ivax and
Key Pharma both took more than 10 years before their revenues grew to a point where
they were sellable companies.


Opko currently realizes the time frame which will be required to ramp up revenues as well
as the uncertainty which is always associated with bringing new products through the FDA
and then into the market. Opko also realizes that it will continue to absorb significantly
larger expenses as a result of the acquisitions, even prior to any ultimate revenues which
may be realized.


However, despite this clear communication from Opko, many investors are making their
own forecasts of surging revenues that will seemingly lead to immediate near-term
profitability.


A dose of reality - how many billions in revenue?


Many Opko bulls have predicted that Opko is going to launch a series of new drugs which
will each immediately bring in multi-billion dollar revenues.


Opko does have numerous new and attractive shots on goal. Its drugs will certainly
address very attractive market opportunities. Yet we can see that this extreme level of
optimism is clearly quite overdone when viewed in the context of the best selling drugs of
all time.


Simon King of FirstWord Pharma recently posted a list of the all-time best selling drugs
along with the revenue numbers they achieved in their absolutely best peak years.


In order to qualify as one of the best selling drugs of all time across all years, a drug
needs to be able to generate peak sales of around $5 billion in any single given year.


A list from the Pharmacy Times shows that the cut-off level for the best selling drugs in
2011 was much lower, at $2.7 billion.


In other words, if even one of Opko's new drug candidates sells $1 billion, it would be
going from a base of zero to the pharmaceutical stratosphere immediately.


And in this article, Rich Duprey provides numbers that are far more realistic based on
global revenues realized by competing drugs for Replidea and Alpharen (Cytochroma's
drugs). The reality he shows is that competing drugs from Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) and

Sanofi (NYSE:SNY) which are already established and successful in the market only
generate revenues of around $300-$600 million. And the other reality is that it will likely
take a number of years to ramp up to that level.


There are two points that the very bullish authors are missing when they provide their
mega billions in revenue forecasts. First, there are established drugs which have been
competing strongly in the market for many years.


Second, not all individuals with these conditions end up taking drugs. Duprey notes that
"surgery is the typical standard of care for secondary hyperparathyroidism."


As a result, when authors simply start multiplying numbers of sufferers by expected drug
prices they come up with spectacular forecasts which end up being far higher than what
we see in the real world.


Launching a drug from zero to $300 million in revenue is obviously a major
accomplishment. However, in making an evaluation of the current share price, investors
need to realize that this level is actually 70-90% lower than what is being predicted by
various authors who have set ultra-high expectations of numerous multi-billion dollar
drugs.


The dramatic rise in the share price and the $2 billion market cap make it clear that many
people are betting that the stock will realize these bullish forecasts even when they are
impossible to reconcile with real world revenue potential.


And also of importance is the fact that these revenues are not expected to ramp up until
2015.


Revenue potential is reflected in the acquisition prices


These lower but more realistic revenue projections should not come as a surprise to
anyone who has followed the terms of Opko's acquisitions.


With Cytochroma, Opko issued $100 million in stock up front and may provide up to $190
million in additional payments subject to certain performance milestones.


Cytochroma has two drugs in late stage trials, Replidea and Alpharen. If it were the
expectation that these drugs would be pulling in several billion dollars in revenues within
the next 2-3 years, then they simply would not have sold for a mere $100 million upfront.
And in fact, there would have been numerous other buyers who would have been happy
to bid far more than the $100 million plus $190 million in milestone payments.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 11/30


The fact is that when an acquirer such as Opko buys a new drug (company), it expects to
obtain its payback over the course of several years and it discounts the price based on the
uncertainty involved in getting the drug successfully approved by the FDA and accepted
by the market.


For Opko, they were willing to pay $100 million upfront, and Cytochroma was willing to
accept. If everything goes perfectly, then Cytochroma founders will get an additional $190
million over coming years, if or when the success happens.


Pulling in several hundred million dollars off a newly purchased drug is no small
accomplishment and it would certainly be yet another coup for Dr. Frost.


But with a valuation of over $2 billion before the drugs are even through their clinical trials,
investors need to ask if the regulatory and commercial success of these drugs is already
being priced in before the events have been proven. The sellers of Cytochroma were
more than willing to put the value at an immediate $100 million.


A balanced look at 4KScore's prospects


The nearest-term revenue development is expected to be the launch of the 4KScore test
for detecting prostate cancer. As a result, it is arguably the most important element for
evaluating the current share price and the results are expected to be positive for Opko.


Opko notes that the 4KScore test as "a next-generation prostate cancer test" which "could
create a diagnostic test able to accurately predict prostate cancer-positive biopsies." In
addition, Opko notes that 750,000 unnecessary prostate biopsies are performed annually
in the US. According to Opko, "A panel combining our PSA test and our novel kallikrein
markers could create a diagnostic test able to accurately predict prostate cancer-positive
biopsies."


However Barron's challenged Opko's prostate test, saying:


A May 2010 Journal of Clinical Oncology report by the test's developers claimed that
their four-marker test would reduce unnecessary biopsies by half. However, an
accompanying editorial in the same issue pointed out that the new screen was less
sensitive than existing tests-failing to detect 14% of high-grade cancers-and was not
likely to change prostate-cancer mortality.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 12/30


The 4KScore test has already been launched in Europe and is expected to be launched in
the US in 2013. Opko's recent acquisition of OURLab provides the company with 18
phlebotomy sites in the US, with a national sales force that calls on urologists.


Ongoing sales of competing PSA tests suggest that the revenue potential for this market
is indeed quite large. However, investors in Opko do need to temper their optimism with
some amount of realism in terms of what to expect and when, in terms of sales of prostate
cancer diagnostic tests.


The sales force will no doubt help the marketing effort for the 4KScore, but it cannot
increase the test's ability to actually detect prostate cancer.


There are two issues that investors should consider when making their revenue forecasts:
competition and emerging medical trends regarding PSA testing. As for competition,
Opko will certainly not be the first company to launch a revolutionary new PSA based test
and then see its stock price soar. As noted in the New York Times quite a few years ago:


The stock price of Biomerica Inc. quadrupled yesterday after the tiny medical
technology company said it would produce a five-minute test for the diagnosis of
prostate cancer... The company said it would first sell the test outside the United
States and would begin sales here if it received clearance from the Food and Drug
Administrationâ€¦ Biomerica's shares soared $7.375, or 311 percent, to close at
$9.75 on volume of 3.6 million shares in Nasdaq trading.


As with Opko, Biomerica's EZ-PSA prostate cancer test was first launched outside of the
US and was subsequently approved in Japan as well. The EZ-PSA test is still
commercially available. However, Biomerica (BMRA.OB) never had blockbuster success
from the test. Biomerica's stock has now traded down to $1.20 and has a market cap of
just $8 million.


Biomerica actually bears some similarities to Opko and describes it business as:


Biomerica, Inc.(Biomerica), develops, manufactures, and markets medical diagnostic
products designed for the early detection and monitoring of chronic diseases and
medical conditions.


The company will do close to $8 million in revenue this year, and with a market cap of just
$8 million and no debt, it actually appears to be a very interesting speculative buy.

Competition has meant that the prices of PSA tests have come down substantially, with
some test centers providing various tests for as low as $49.00.


In assessing revenue prospects for Opko's 4KScore, some bullish authors have assumed
that Opko will immediately capture a 50% market share while simultaneously charging
triple the price for PSA tests. The result was $1.8 billion in annual revenues expected by
a recent author.


Each investor will have his or her own individual method of forecasting, however, using
more realistic assumptions for price (below $100) and market share (15-20%) would yield
a number that is at most $200-300 million. This is still a considerable amount of revenue
to realize from a new product, however investors do need to realize that such estimates
fall around 85% below the $1.8 billion level that many seem to be hoping for.


Author Josh Ginsberg recently estimated that Opko would be realizing as much as $8.3
billion per year based on the 4KScore and Opko's near-term drug prospects. In doing so,
he quoted the $1.8 billion forecast for 4K from another author.


However Mr. Ginsberg does suggest that individual readers conduct their own due
diligence in arriving at such estimates.


Some of the competition may not come from competing PSA tests at all, but instead
will come from competing non-PSA technologies.


According to a 2012 article in MedCity News:


Armune Bioscience Inc. is developing a test based on serum autoantibodies,
which the company says are more stable than antigens and may be easier to detect
during early stage cancer. First, the company is focusing on creating an alternative
to the low-specificity, prostate-specific antigen test that's the current standard for
detecting prostate cancer.


The company has already raised over $3 million from investors to develop the test.


According to a 2012 article in Fierce Biomarkers:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1167631-dose-of-reality-opko-set-for-a-pullback-as-insider-selling-begins 14/30


Beckman Coulter (NYSE:DHR) has received premarket approval from the FDA for
its biomarker-based Prostate Health Index (PHI). According to the company, this test
is 2.5 times more specific in detecting prostate cancer than PSA (prostate-
specific antigen) tests in men with raised levels of PSA, and could cut the number of
unnecessary prostate biopsies 31%.


In addition, Quest Diagnostics (NYSE:DGX) currently offers a urine-based screening test
for prostate cancer.


Medical pushback against prostate cancer testing 
In reality, a much bigger potential impediment to Opko realizing 4K's full revenue potential
could be the increasing amount of backlash that PSA tests are facing from the medical
community. The backlash against PSA testing has been building for two years now and
seems to have escalated substantially in 2012.


These criticisms are coming from many of the most respected names in the medical field
with respect to prostate cancer. Surprisingly, they are calling for a near halt to the
widespread use of PSA tests used as an advanced screener.


The PSA test was actually invented by Dr. Richard Albin. In a New York Times OpEd
piece entitled "The Great Prostate Mistake," Dr. Albin decried the current over-use of
PSA tests as:


"a profit-driven public health disaster."


Later, an article entitled "PSA Screenings: a Money-Making Scam" went even further to
hammer home the same point.


Most recently, the backlash against PSA testing seems to have come to a head in much
broader medical circles. The San Francisco Chronicle noted that:


many possible screening programs turn out not to do any good - and in fact some
tests like PSA cause harm. That's why virtually all expert public health panels do not
recommend the PSA test.


Also in 2012, an article entitled "Harvard expert urges caution for use of new prostate
cancer test" raised similar concerns. Each of these authors raises a wide range of points
which suggest that the problems with PSA testing outweigh the benefits for many of the

men who end up getting the test done. The authors go on to strongly criticize the industry
for over-promoting PSA tests in pursuit of profits.


They suggest that the appropriate target market should consists primarily of men who
have already had prostate surgery, rather than as a predictive measure performed in
advance. Clearly such a shift would result in a very dramatic reduction in the size of the
addressable market.


For now it seems safe to say that PSA tests will continue to be widely used for the
foreseeable future. However, the increasing trend in the medical community to curtail their
use should certainly be considered as a factor by those who are expecting multi-billion
dollar revenues from 4KScore alone and in the very near term.


Such investors should also keep in mind the strong cautionary comments raised by the
medical community specifically with respect to Opko's prostate cancer test, as was
highlighted in Barron's.


Playing the short squeeze


Even when the share price was just over $4.00, the short interest in Opko was enormous.
During 2012, the short interest in the stock typically ranged from 30-32 million shares, so
about 25% of the outstanding share count at the time.


The bet on the short side was premised on the fact that at $4.00, Opko was still a $1.2
billion company with almost no revenues and with losses that were increasing
substantially each quarter.


Much of the recent surge in the share price can be clearly attributed to short sellers
scrambling to cover.


We can see from the Nasdaq that the overall short interest has now fallen by nearly 30%.
Meanwhile, the number of days to cover the short interest has fallen from 43 days in
August to just 11 days at present. The short in Opko was very large, but is now very
moderate.


As a result, short covering cannot be expected to continue to prop up the share price
going forward, and in fact shorts will likely begin re-entering the stock at current levels.

Conclusion - knowing when to take profits and when to re-enter


Shares of Opko have been on a spectacular run and have been boosted by a series of
simultaneous positive factors including:


The positive signaling effect from Dr. Frost's small purchases.
Ample positive attention from Jim Cramer.
A notable short squeeze.
Ongoing enthusiasm from bullish authors with ultra bullish revenue forecasts


However with a market cap of over $2 billion, the stock is clearly one of the most
overvalued names in the healthcare space relative to its actual revenue prospects over
the next 2-3 years.
