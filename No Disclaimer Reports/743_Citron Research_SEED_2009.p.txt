CITRON REPORTS ON
ORIGIN AGRITECH
(NASDAQ:SEED)


Be Careful with your SEED Capital


One of the great movie thoughts in history comes
from the classic Night Shift, when an o�beat
Michael Keaton suggests: “Wait a minute! Why
don’t they just mix the mayonnaise with the tuna
in the can… HOLD THE PHONE ! Why don’t they
just FEED the tuna �sh mayonnaise?! 
A good idea, but hardly groundbreaking. Citron
recalls the classic “peanut-butter-and-jelly in the
same jar” story of Nitromed (NASDAQ:NTMD) which
claimed a breakthrough drug that was made up of
two available generic drugs. Needless to say,
despite the advice of numerous analysts, it was an
utter disaster for stockholders.


Introducing Origin Agritech, (NASDAQ:SEED)


Background


SEED stock was rocketed by a PR announcing the
Chinese government’s approval of the company’s
genetically engineered seed corn that adds the
enzyme phytase to the diet of livestock. Phytase
helps feed animals digest phosphorus, a necessary
nutrient.

gm-phytase-corn-licensed
[http://www.thepigsite.com/swinenews/17199/�rst-
gm-phytase-corn-licensed] . The company actually
announced this 2 years ago when they �rst licensed
the product from the China Academy of
Agricultural Science (CAAS)…yes licensed not
created the product. Considering SEED does not
appear to be in the business of creating innovative
block-buster products this is no surprise. On their
8/11/09 conference call, in Q&A, they mention their
next two big ideas are glyphosate-resistant corn
and a VT corn product. Both of these products are
already o�ered by Monsanto (Round-up resistant
corn and VT corn).


This story has a lot of problems, including:


No clarity on exclusivity of license
No clarity on license �nancial terms
No clarity on the economic impact of
the innovation
SEED has lost money for three years…
and in particular
SEED needs money urgently.


Phytase facts


Lets put this in perspective: phytase is not exactly
gold. It can be added for $2 a ton to feed corn. This
is not an economic game changer regardless what
any analyst might say. Phytase is currently o�ered
in many forms for sale by the largest names in
agriculture.

in genetically-engineered corn is only that it
relieves the grower of the inconvenience of
mixing in this supplement. . The claimed bene�t
that:


“Origin’s GMO phytase-producing corn is
expected to reduce the need for inorganic
phosphate supplements as animals will
directly absorb more phosphate from their
feed, reducing animal feed’s high cost.
Inorganic phosphates may be contaminated
with �uorin and heavy metal residues
created in the manufacturing process. These
�uorin and heavy metal residues in the
feedstu� are toxic to animals, and dangerous
to humans. Origin plans to release further
details of the development of their phytase
product line as this develops.”

…is pseudoscienti�c mumbo jumbo. (Any phytase
supplement delivers this bene�t …. For $2.00 to
$2.50 per ton of feed. (see alibaba.com link above
for 132 suppliers.)


Presumably, this will justify a higher sale price for
their seed corn. However, the �nancial upside
appears to be limited by the extremely low cost of
adding phytase to animal feed, especially because
the majority of their sales of this new seed
cannibalize sales to existing customers — seed corn
already accounts for 75% of SEED’s revenue. It is
the opinion of Citron that any lofty pie in the sky
numbers given by SEED are done with the intention
of raising money in the near future and have no
bearing on their economic reality.


Company unpro�table


SEED last reported an annual pro�t in 2006. It
reported sizable losses for 2007 (163,000,000 RMB,
7.904 / $20.6m USD loss ) and 2008 (43,286,000
RMB / $6.2m USD loss ) . Historically, it also shows
extreme seasonality in its revenues; its only

pro�table quarter appears to be the June 30 period,
when the bulk of its annual seed sales are booked.


Despite a reported $11 million pro�t for this year’s
June quarter, it has accumulated an overall loss for
the 9 months of 3.8 million, which will be even
larger when the company reports full-year
operations, since it does not expect to have


material revenues during the 4th quarter. Investors
won’t see these numbers until SEED �les its 20-F,
expected next March. Because they sell seed, they
traditionally have one good quarter that gets folded
into an annual loss.


Beware the dreaded PIPE


Meanwhile, SEED is in the midst of an obligation to
buy out a convertible note �nancing done in July
2007. The company borrowed $40 million at 16%
interest from Citadel with a senior convertible note.
It has announced in �lings and PR that it has agreed
to repay the outstanding balance of $17.2 million by
Dec 31, 2009.

id=62]


The problem is the company’s cash balance is only
$22.8 million. Clearly it is reasonable to expect the
company is going to be selling stock in the very
near future. For a stock that generally trades
around 50,000 shares a day, and whose share price
has languished most of the last two years between
$2 and $5, their opportunity is now and the time
window is limited.


This is enhanced by the recent upgrade on the
company from Rodman & Renshaw. Citron’s last
run-in with Rodman & Renshaw saw them upgrade
Home Solutions of America, while the company was
committing fraud and now trading for pennies.
Rodman simultaneously was shopping a deal for
the company…..surprise surprise…..its the same
analyst who upgraded Home Solutions
(NASDAQ:HSOA) Joe Giamichael!  And here we
thought Giamichael’s specialty was industrial
services…..hmmm, now its agriculture?

HSOA collapsed amid massive fraud and is now 3c.


Conclusion


Citron suggests that investors hoping to harvest
pro�ts should plant a seed of caution here, and
fertilize it with common sense. It is the prediction of
Citron that SEED’s product will become just another
agricultural alternative that will either get
commoditized away or never by itself revolutionize
the vertically integrated world of farming. BTW….is
anyone working on the mayo idea?
