Pingify (PGFY) –
Statements By Pingify’s CEO
Omit Material Facts
May 8, 2014 By GeoTeam


On the morning of May 6, 2014, we published a pump and
dump investor alert about Pingify (OTCQB:PGFY) for
GeoInvesting premium members:


The company went public through a self-directed IPO,
where the CEO received 25 million shares at a cost
basis of $0.001 ($150,000).
The company is touting its product as a lead
generation tool to match buyers and sellers. As an
example, here is an excerpt from its 2013 10-K.


“We are working with a leading auto classified
site to provide a means for their dealers to
deliver Branded Pings to our users, once we have
users of our app. Our users will have given us
the information for the types of vehicles they are
currently seeking. With this information, we will
provide a targeted lead generation system to the
dealers. The user only gets Pings for vehicles
they are looking for and the dealer only pays for
Pings sent to users that are requesting them.”


Like many past successful pumps, the company’s SEC
filings go into great detail about business strategies
and market opportunities. There is no press release
flow yet but a major third party promotional campaign

by an “unaffiliated 3rd party” Laluna Services Inc. had
commenced for $6.5 million.
50.1% of the stock is owned by the company’s
President and CEO. The only other employee of the
company is the CFO who owns no stock and does not
receive any compensation. We find it hard to believe
that the CFO is not being “compensated” in some
manner.
The company uses all the right social media buzz
words in its filings by stating that its app will be able
to work on cell phones and is available on iTunes. The
company also claims it is developing a Facebook app
and throws in the hot Software as a Service (“SAAS”)
reference.
We learned that the iTunes application was available
for download on March 8, 2012 and that a relationship
with Beyond.com to receive $0.05 per click is over a
year old. Apparently, these ventures are not going
that well. According to the company’s last 10-Q it
didn’t earn any revenues.


PGFY reached an intra-day high of $1.72 on May 5, 2014.
Since our note on May 6, 2014, the stock has been on a
wild ride. In yesterday’s trading session, shares touched
$0.20 and closed at $0.35, down 56%. Shares fell in a
response to a press release issued after the close on May
6, 2014 that the company’s CFO, Vlad Milutin, submitted a
letter of resignation:


“San Jose, CA / ACCESSWIRE / May 6, 2014 /
Pingify International, Inc. (PGFY) Chief Financial
Officer and Director Vlad Milutin, submitted his
resignation to company President Jason Gray
today, in objection to a promotion campaign to
artificially raise the price and trading volume of
Pingify. According to Mr. Milutin, the promotion
campaign, otherwise known as a pump and dump
scheme, has significantly overinflated the value

of Pingify shares, especially in the light of the
company’s current business position.”


Here is the entire letter written by the CFO to the CEO,
Jason Gray, which includes a plea to the SEC and FNRA to
investigate the trading activity in shares of PGFY:


Dear Jason:


I am greatly depressed by the recently
commenced promotion campaign on Pingify
stock. That the public could be conned into giving
this company with no assets and limited
prospects, upwards of a $75 million market cap
is quite distressing to me. I am not aware of any
contracts or other sources of revenue at this time
and no assets on the books. That emails from
Mike Statler of StockTips could paint such a rosy
picture as to suggest these shares are worth
$5.00 each, thereby giving the company a $250
million market cap, is ludicrous.


Obviously, one or more of the purchasers of S-1
shares @$.005 is behind this effort to defraud
the public, as they held all of the shares of the
company not owned by you. As I did not recruit
any of the shareholders, I am sorry that more
effort was not done on your part to determine
the honorable intentions of these seed
shareholders. I call on the SEC and FINRA to
investigate the trading of the shares of Pingify,
International, Inc. and determine the people who
are responsible for this pump and dump effort.
As a consequence of my concerns, I am hereby
submitting my resignation as CFO and Director of
Pingify International, Inc., effective immediately.

https://geoinvesting.com/statements-by-pingifys-ceo-omit-material-facts/ 4/8


Sincerely,


Vlad Milutin


In response to share volatility, on May 7, 2014, the
company issued two relevant press releases. The first press
release at 12:54 ET stated that the company signed a
letter of intent (LOI) to acquire 80 Elements
Entertainment,


“Pingify signs letter of intent with 80 Elements
Entertainment. This acquisition will provide
Pingify with a solid development team and a new
source of revenue. 80ELEMENTS specializes in
creating dynamic driven web site platforms and
applications that harness the power of today’s
media delivery technologies.”


What the company fails to tell investors in the release is
that this “LOI” appears to just be the regurgitation of old
news and has been on and off the table since August 2013:


Q2 2013 SEC filing:


On August 17, 2013, the Company entered into letter of
intent to acquire 80 Elements Entertainment Inc. (“80
Elements”) for approximately 940,000 in restricted
common shares, issued from treasury.


Q3 2013 SEC filing:


“As of October 31, 2013, the Company has not
entered into a definitive agreement to acquire 80
Elements Entertainment Inc. (“80 Elements”) and
the original letter of intent has expired.” “80
Elements Entertainment Acquisition (1-2

months) Though the LOI has expired, Pingify is
still in acquisition discussions with 80 Elements”


Given the recent developments we hold the opinion that
management is not being totally transparent with investors
by ignoring the progression, or lack thereof, of the 80
Elements LOI. Less sophisticated investors likely don’t read
SEC filings closely and will solely rely on press releases to
perform due diligence. We also find it deceitful that PGFY
did not disclose the revenue of 80 Elements, only including
a comment from the president of 80 Elements:


“We have the most efficient team we have ever
had this year. So overhead is slightly lower,”
says Boris Chow, President of 80 Elements. “We
are definitely on track to hit our revenue target
by the end of 2014.”


A second press release issued at 2:30 PM ET discussed the
CFO resignation, basically telling investors to focus on the
positive aspects of PGFY’s “growth” story, not even
addressing the CFO’s opinion that investors who received
stock per the original S-1 filing are part of a pump and
dump scheme to artificially pump PGFY shares. Why didn’t
the CEO at least acknowledge that he is on the case and
does not endorse the “parties” behind the promotional
campaign? Instead, the CEO insinuates that the company
is succeeding in the implementation of its business plan:


“As per the S-1A filing with the SEC submitted in
March 16, 2012 an agreement with Beyond.com
was entered into on March 13, 2012. As well,
Pingify became an eBay partner and filed the
completion of integration in the 10K for 2013.
Currently, users are downloading our application

that is available on the iTunes store and actively
find results with eBay and Beyond.com.”


Well, the CEO should have disclosed this statement from its
2013 10-K:


“We own our domain name PINGIFY.COM. We
currently have less than $10 in revenues from
the sale of our app and no lead-generation
payments from our partners (“Agents”). As of
March 8, 2012, the application became available
and we anticipate lead-generation revenues to
begin after sufficient capital has been raised.”


It is also worth noting that PGFY’s app has been available
on iTunes since March 2014:


“As of March 8, 2012 the PINGIFY application
became available in the iTunes store in both
Canada and the US. This version focuses solely
on Craigslist, the world’s largest free bulletin
board website.”


Again, this is all old news. The CEO should address why,
after having these relationships in place for over two years,
the company still has not generated meaningful revenue.


According to the company’s most recent 10-K, PGFY’s
annual revenue for fiscal year 2013 is $0. And with only
$2,209 on its balance sheet, we find it hard to imagine how
PGFY can execute its business plan. Without raising a
significant capital, the company would have tremendous
difficulties to compete with the established competitors
such as Nearbynow, Admob, and Jumptap, as listed in its
own 10-K.

We think investors would appreciate it if the CEO would
comment on:


A newsletter that was paid 6.5 million dollars to
promote PGFY.
Why has it not been able to monetize its business plan
– at all.
How much capital does PGFY need to generate
meaningful revenue?
What were the revenues of 80 Elements for 2013?


We also urge the regulatory bodies to take a close look at
who is behind the alleged pump and dump scheme that is
sure to cause significant losses to long investors – a
campaign that is being funded by a staggering $6.5 million
– one of the biggest we have ever come across in the
Pump and Dump space! We applaud the CFO’s candid
reaction to the aggressive pump campaign that transpired.
