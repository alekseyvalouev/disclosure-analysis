PGWC: More links Emerge


Between PGWC and Hung


Chiu-Hu.


Several �lings of the Securities and Exchange Commission


(“SEC”) reveal links between Pegasus Wireless Corporation


(NASDAQ: PGWC, $6.96) and Taiwanese national Hung Chiu-


Hu who stands accused of embezzling more than $525


million, which go beyond Mr. Hu serving as a director of


Vision 2000 Venture, Ltd (“Vision”), a major shareholder in


PGWC and PGWC’s largest subsidiary (see asensio.com


report “PGWC’s Links To The ‘Corporate Scandal Of The


Century’” of July 26, 2006).


An individual by the name of John Y. W. Seto was once


mysteriously identi�ed as a newly-elected director of


Pegasus Wireless Corp in a company’s press release titled


“Pegasus Wireless Corporation Announces Completion of


Merger,” published on December 21, 2004.


Interestingly enough, Mr. Seto never became a director of


Pegasus, at least not according to any of the company’s SEC


�lings, which do not contain a mention of him.


Yet SEC �lings by several other companies establish multiple


links between Mr. Seto and Mr. Hu.


Advanced Analogic Technologies Incorporated’s (NASDAQ:


AATI $9.28) SEC �lings show that Mr. Seto was also a director


of Vision and of AATI. Vision is an AATI shareholder. In the

�lings by ChipMOS Technologies (Bermuda) Limited


(NASDAQ: IMOS $5.66) both individuals served as directors


of IMOS.


Most importantly, Mr. Hu was Mosel Vitelic Inc.’s (“Mosel”)


Chairman while Mr. Seto was its Executive Vice President.


Mr. Hu stands accused of stealing hundreds of millions of


dollars from Paci�c Electric Wire and Cable Corporation


while he served as the company’s Director of Finance,


through a network of a hundred and forty-six dummy


corporations. Taiwanese newspaper Taipei Times indicated


that Mosel, the sole proprietor of Vision, might have also


been a victim of Mr. Hu’s scams.


Several IMOS �lings mention a company named Vision2000


Venture, Ltd (“Vision2000”), whose name is identical to PGWC


shareholder Vision without the space between Vision and


2000. According to those documents, the company is 100%


owned by Mosel. Mr. Seto also served as a Vision2000


director in 2005, according to �lings by Ramtron


International Corporation (NASDAQ: RMTR, $2.30). Also a


�ling by AATI lists the business address for Vision 2000


Venture Ltd (and Mr. Hu’s) as c/o Mosel Taiwan.


Vision2000 also owns 31.51% of shares of PacMOS


Technologies Holdings Limited (HKSE: 1010.HK, $0.72).


An IMOS �ling of May 26, 2006 notes that “the indictment


relating to Mr. Hung-Chiu Hu alleges that embezzled funds


were used in investments by PacMOS Technologies Holdings


Limited, which, as of March 31, 2006, owned 5.5% of our


outstanding common shares.”


As the links between PGWC and Mr. Hu and his scams are


�eshed out, the question looms of just how the NASDAQ


allows PGWC to continue to trade without PGWC clarifying


how many shares it has outstanding, who owns them and


what PGWC received for issuing those shares. Perhaps an Privacy  - Terms

even more important question is what the NASDAQ will do


about its decision to join PGWC’s stock promotion.
