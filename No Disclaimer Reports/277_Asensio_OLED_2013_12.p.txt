OLEDinfo’s undisclosed ties to Universal Display.


Posted on October 7, 2013 by asensio.com


Today OLEDinfo.com published a series of articles on flexible OLED


products that underlie unfounded attributions about some


undisclosed Universal Display Corp. (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED)


interest in LG’s and/or Samsung’s flexible OLED inventions.


OLEDinfo did not disclose that its founder owns UDC stock. The site


is controlled by Ron Mertens. Mr. Mertens is a 37 year old self-


described web entrepreneur living in Israel. He controls OLEDinfo


through MetalGrass. Mr. Mertens has no expertise in OLED flexible


products, phosphorescent or fluorescent emitter materials, or the


existing competition in this small esoteric emitter materials market.


Another of Mr. Merten’s promotional sites is a controversial


promoter of graphene. The Wall Street Journal stated that


“Graphene …is still far too expensive … it doesn’t lend itself to use
in some computer-chip circuitry and scientists are still trying to find


better ways to turn it into usable form.” Some U.S. vendors are


selling a layer of graphene on copper foil for about $60 a square


inch. Kenneth Teo, a director at the Cambridge unit of Germany’s


Aixtron SE (NASDAQ: AIXG) that makes machines to produce


graphene has stated that “[graphene] needs to be around one dollar


per square inch for high-end electronic applications such as fast


transistors, and for less than 10 cents per square inch for touch-


screen displays.”


UDC has not been forthcoming to its investors about the


termination date and clauses of its Samsung agreement and has


chosen to use highly controversial accounting methods that do not


comply with generally accepted accounting principles to report


revenues. UDC has refused to disclose important terms of its


Samsung agreement, including the list of patents covered by its


license. UDC has not disclosed that it would receive any payments
