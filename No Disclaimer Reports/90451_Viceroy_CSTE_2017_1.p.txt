Caesarstone (NASDAQ:CSTE) 


Nothing on the counter. 


 CSTE’s major revenue growth product, marketed as a collaboration with Lowe’s, is not for sale


according to Lowe’s Customer Services and store checks. This is contrary sell-side forecasts


highlighting this as a growth driver.


 Of CSTE’s listed sales agents, there is a growing percentage no longer sell (or have never sold)


CSTE products, switching to higher margin products. Agents who sell CSTE are charging a


higher retail price than consumers pay at IKEA for identical products. Ikea countertops include


free installation!


 We believe CSTE’s inventory should be revised materially downwards to reflect decreasing


average selling prices within their larger customers.


 SEC enquiries into CSTE revenue growth factors inconsistently addressed by management. The


major revenue variance factor, increased average selling price, is not supported by channel


checks which show prices decreasing at major customers/outlets.


 CSTE’s market analysis documents are illogical and over represent their poor market impact.


In reality, the significance of growing competition in the USA goes unaddressed by CSTE. The


market is extremely saturated with big players including Vadara Quartz, headed by the former


CSTE USA division CEO Arik Tendler, and low-opex Asia-Pac players1 who can better compete


on price for a virtually undifferentiated product.


 Competitor analysis suggests CSTE are either not maintaining machinery adequately or that


machinery is severely underutilised.


 CSTE has consistently missed guidance; a theme we identify and is unlikely to change.


 Shareholder friendly programmes discontinued. CSTE is now a negative earnings growth


vehicle with no payout policy.

Figure 3 Chardan CSTE note – 11 May 2017 


The Chardan valuation is on a similar ‘Hollywood’ justification as other sellside analysts, including 


Stifel, who appear to have the most inconsistent valuation on a stock ever: 


Figure 4 Stifel CSTE note – 24 March 2017 


Earnings misses & downgrades, impromptu management changes, auditor concerns, quality concerns, 


increasingly competitive markets, and Kibbutz board backstabbing activism are apparently obscure 


concepts to Stifel, who simply provide a hindsight note after a major share price fall, then upgrade a 


few weeks later, all on the back of an obscure EV/EBITDA multiple.  


On top of this, management embarrassingly had to revise its earnings dowwards on the back of 


accounting misstatements, an issue perhaps foreshadowed in Spruce Point pieces. 


Lowes 
CSTE’s 20F4 states that the company “commenced offering our products and related services in several 


Lowe’s stores in the United States in the first quarter of 2017”. Management commented further on 


this development in the company’s Q1 earnings call5: 


“We are already in around 200 stores in few of the states, that Lowe selected.”

earnings-call-transcript?part=single
It appears, that the company failed to inform Lowe’s of this latest development  or CSTE lack the 


foresight to communicate with their end-customers effectively to any material sales.  


Our channel checks with Lowes’s Customer Service confirm the Transform™ 


product is not available at Lowe’s stores as of the date of this report, nor is any 


other CSTE product.  


Physical channel checks into Lowe’s stores and a review of their online catalogue confirms that no 


CSTE product is available for purchase at any Lowe’s store as of the date of this report. Meanwhile, 


Lowe’s is stocking what appears to be an increasing catalogue of products from CSTE competitors 


Silestone. 


There are further concerns over the Transform™ product if it ever enters the market on a large scale 


basis. An experienced industry contractor has advised he would be hesitant to fit the product as the 


thin quartz layer is likely susceptible to wear and tear and cracking, and overlayed on top of old fittings, 


which are susceptible to rot and pungent stale water, causes smells near sinks6. The transform product 


is not a permanent solution. 


SEC 
The SEC issued a request for further information to clarify a number of ambiguous statements in 


CSTE’s 2015 20-F, specifically in regards to revenue movements (including FX and average selling 


prices) and aggregated operating segments. 


Management’s address of revenue variance factors do not corroborate with our channel checks. 


Increased average selling prices do not reflect ground level pricing, which we have 


found to be decreasing, and excessive volume increases do not correspond to the 


consensus of the CSTE reseller agents we contacted. 


Caesarstone claim to have high quality products. Not only was this disproven by Sprucepoint Capital’s 


work7, but also now in CSTE’s own revenue growth and margins8. In CSTE’s own conference, 


management were unable to explain how the growth occurred. Management could not explain how 


there was an increase in Ikea sales.  


IKEA 
CSTE’s statements about average selling prices are contradicted by their customers' advertised selling 


prices.

0A5A9E349A63/2016 Caesarstone Annual Report.pdf
Between 2015 and 2017, CSTE's Ikea catalogue prices decreased by between ~3% 


and 15% (excluding enticements, and free installation!).  


The reality is Ikea is suffering as a result of greater competition in the market place. 


Silicosis – The cost of doing business! 
Silicosis is an emerging risk in workers who process quartz and other silicon dust producing materials. 


This is an unknown variable for CSTE. Although provisions have been made for those claims filed, it’s 


noteworthy that there is a significant class action that could have a material impact on the company’s 


balance sheet, approximately, $56m.  


There has been no provision for this $56m class action. 


Competition 
Quartz countertops are undoubtedly a market where competition is growing significantly. Price 


reductions are being seen in the range of 3-15% in IKEA alone. IKEA prices their stock at a 18%-35% 


discount to identical CSTE reseller retail prices. 


With so many companies intending to compete within the marketplace, it is of additional concern that 


CSTE USA’s former CEO Arik Tendler has entered the market with a product who's marketing appears 


to address many of CSTE’s negative online reviews related highlighting quality concerns.  


Comparisons 
A comparative financial analysis against competitor Silestone reinforces our belief that Caesarstone’s 


financial statements are misrepresented. Specifically: 








 Caesarstone’s marketing expenses are remarkably low, considering they allege to have over


10x distributors in the USA vs Silestone 


 Caesarstone’s maintenance capex spending is substantially lower than Silestone, despite


CSTE’s higher revenues and COGS 


 Silestone’s margins (as a premium product) are 20% higher, suggesting less volume sold per


unit of revenue and therefore lower wear & tear machinery expenses


 All quartz machinery (incl. frequent wear & tear replacement parts) is bought from niche


group of suppliers with limited price variances.
3. Nothing on the counter at Lowe’s


Caesarstone’s market expansion strategy took on another direction in their most recent filings 


announcing a collaboration with Lowe’s™, marketing a new overlay product called Transform™.  


CSTE’s 20F12 states that the company “commenced offering our products and related services in several 


Lowe’s stores in the United States in the first quarter of 2017”.  


It appears that either the company failed to inform Lowe’s of this latest development or the time 


expectations of commercialising this agreement are entirely flawed. The product is not available at 


Lowe’s stores via Customer Service for purchase, pre-order or samples as of the date of this report. 


In fact, Lowe’s Customer service has never heard of this product! 


Lowe’s in-store channel checks 
Analysts and investors should check Lowe’s sales channels before suggesting its significance as a 


growth driver.  


We spoke with Lowe’s on multiple occasions from the time of CSTE’s first collaboration 


announcement13 (8 February 2017) to the date of this report making extensive inquiries. Not one of 


Lowe’s customer service representatives we spoke to was able to locate Caesarstone’s Transform™ 


product (or any CSTE product)!  


Two customer service agents suggested we try Ikea™ or purchasing another product: Silestone. It is 


worthwhile noting that while Lowe’s stocks no Caesarstone of any kind, they have an extensive range 


of Silestone and a few other brands, including their own brand.   


Not one of Lowe’s customer service representatives we spoke to were able to 


locate Caesarstone’s Transform™ product! (Or any Caesarstone product 


whatsoever) 


The sell side are expecting a material upside in the Lowe’s collaboration and a reputed revenue 


‘growth driver’. Based on this data, it's likely investors are going to be left materially disappointed.

13 http://ir.caesarstone.com/secfiling.cfm?filingID=1178913-17-338&CIK=1504379
Online channel check 
We conducted an online search on Lowe’s website searching by brand (search term: Quartz 


Countertops*) 14 (Accessed June 07, 2017).  


Figure 6 Lowe's Website Results - Search Term Quartz Countertops 


*Other failed search terms included ‘Transform Worktop, Caesarstone, and Overlay Worktop


A Caesarstone product search on Lowe’s website returned no results, and instead 


offered a healthy range of competitors’ products.  


Key Takeaways 
Despite extensive searches, both in-store, via customer services and Lowe’s website, there was no 


evidence of a Transform roll-out programme. There was no product sample availability, no staff 


awareness of the product and Lowe’s customer service advised there was no pre-order availability for 


any “Transform™” or Caesarstone product. 


Investors in CSTE would be wise to consider Lowe’s spring sales are a key period for the company, as 


with most home-center retailers15. Despite stating sales were expected to start in 2017 Q1, 


Caesarstone have clearly missed this window of opportunity that the building products sector has 


traditionally been reliant on. 


Additionally, if the Transform™ product becomes available at Lowe’s at some stage in the future, 


investors would be wise to consider: 


 Lowe’s is a mass-market retailer with no premium status, similar to IKEA, and such an


agreement will further destroy whatever remaining premium-brand recognition CSTE has


left16.


 CSTE will have to play "Lowe’s-margin" game


 Offering a cheaper substitute product through Lowe's would further deteriorate earnings


through cannibalisation as CTE would essentially be undercutting themselves.

4. Sales Channels – increased competition, fabricated product


offerings & phantom agents
We conducted substantial channel checks into agents listed on CSTE’s website and into product lines 


over the last 3 months. Our main findings were that: 


 The Transform™ product is so far unavailable for purchase at Lowe’s.


 CSTE’s supply chain is filled with phantom agents who no longer sell (and in many instances,


have never sold) Caesarstone products.


 With apparent lack of supply chain management, we doubt that CSTE attempting to recover


any stock they have loaned or extended on credit terms to its reseller agents


 A decline in prices over the past year and CSTE’s market being more competitive, it raises the


question as to the real value of their inventory and finished goods.  It is our view that CSTE


have to revalue their in-house finished goods inventory and inventory held by resellers


represented within CSTE’s accounts receivable.


 CSTE USA’s former CEO Arik Tendler appears to have entered the USA market with a superior


product under the brand Vadara Quartz.  Vadara's marketing appears to address quality issues


that plague Caesarstone online reviews (cracking/chipping, staining17 & using chemicals18).


Our channel checks suggest CSTE is meeting their demand straight from the 


production line, and reseller built up inventory appears to be unpopular stock 


which is difficult to sell. 


Poor sales channel management  
Industry professionals indicate that the market place is significantly more competitive, raising the 


question as to whether CSTE can afford to be failing so miserably in managing their customer referral 


points.  


OMNI-Channel marketing 101 suggest CSTE are ignoring all the basic rules. In the USA, U.K. and 


Australian Markets there is an apparent failure to maintain basic up-to-date reseller agent 


information. There was basic referral information missing such as email, website and/or telephone 


details.  


An industry professional questioned ‘whether there is any management of 


Caesarstone’s sales channels at all.’ 


As a comparison, Silestone’s US agent and supplier list appears well maintained, with basic rules of 


online sales and referrals being followed. 


17 https://countertopinvestigator.com/caesarstone-countertops/  
18 http://ths.gardenweb.com/discussions/2698923/caesarstone-staining
What is the real number of reseller agents in Caesarstone’s network? 
CSTE has more than tenfold the number of alleged registered reseller agents compared to the likes of 


Silestone. CSTE’s agent count is circa 4,050, whereas Silestone’s is a mere 368 (Fig 2). Silestone list 


outlets such as Home Depot and Lowe’s. 


Figure 7 Caesarstone Agents Downloaded as of 16 March 2016 


Figure 8 Silestone Registered Agents as of April 20, 201719 


Our channel checks demonstrated that a good percentage of these agents do not sell, or in some 


instances, have never sold Caesarstone, which raises the question why they were ever recorded as 


reseller agents in the first place. 


Of those alleged registered agents/suppliers contacted, there was a theme. A significant number of 


contractors would entice and promote other products including granite, on the merits of quality, price 


point, and/or not being a Caesarstone agent. 


CSTE's raw ingredient costs were previously exposed by Spruce Point as being materially higher than 


what was disclosed. This is compounded by increased competition in top line sales and a decreasing 


average selling price, reinforced by new and existing competitors expanding and/or entering the 


North American Market.  


19 https://www.silestoneusa.com/where-to-buy/
It’s likely that CSTE’s biggest customer after Ikea is their own marketing department. If CSTE's reseller 


database is accurate, they would require a significant volume of samples.  


Given the spread of their reseller network, it’s no wonder that CSTE’s forecasted revenues in Ikea (the 


largest customer to date) is a “finger in the wind exercise” and subject to SEC enquiries20.  


With a lack of supplier management, we pose the question: what is the cost of display items and 


stock on loan to resellers who are no longer selling Caesarstone products? Should agent inventory 


be reflected on CSTE’s accounts or on a returns basis if it is not sold a end user, it is our view that CSTE 


will have to impair their finished goods inventory held by such agents, (i.e. receivables impairment).  


Australia 
It is difficult to assess CSTE’s commercial relationship footprint in Australia; its second largest market. 


There appears to be a significant lack of reselling agents:  


http://www.caesarstone.com.au/find-a-display 


Only one display room is listed in Sydney, a CSTE branded showroom, and only two in Melbourne, 


despite these being high population areas. With competition increasing, CSTE appear to be falling 


behind its competitors on a real, targeted footprint basis. 


U.K. 
It appears that CSTE has purchased or collated a defunct database of kitchen fitters, worktop 


fabricators and suppliers and transformed this into a reseller catalogue. There is a similar theme to 


the USA where agents are either no longer operating, no longer sell Caesarstone, are exclusive to 


competitors or have never sold CSTE products.  


20 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504379/000117891317000754/zk1719670.htm
5. The Transform Issue
Much hype has surrounded CSTE’s new line at Lowe's, expected to have commenced sales Q1 2017: 


the 13mm quartz overlay branded as the Transform range. The range is being marketed as a new 


alternative to traditional benchtops by fitting a 13mm overlay onto an existing worktop21. Note that 


prior to this announcement Caesarstone has never sold 13mm thickness quartz as a countertop option 


in the North Americas. 


On face value investors would be excited about a new product reaching an as-yet untapped market, 


however Caesarstone’s international sales websites tell a different story.  Our channel checks suggest 


Transform is a repackaged pre-existing product that has been available for sale in overseas market as 


far back as March 2016. 


22


Pure White 13mm thickness on Australian website dated 13/4/2016

23


Frosty Carrina 13mm thickness on Australian website dated 15/4/2016 


 13mm product options are listed on many of CSTE's international websitese including but not limited 


to Brazil, Australia, the UK and Israel.  


Caesarstone has also sold the 13mm quartz in North America before in some of the same colour ranges 


as the Transform product but  as bathroom splashbacks, not countertops. 


23 https://web.archive.org/web/20150315011937/http://caesarstone.com.au/colour/5141-frosty-carrina
The reality of the situation is that Caesarstone’s Transform is likely a mish-mash of 13mm products 


that were unsellable overseas and are now being repackaged as a low-margin solution through Lowe's, 


in the hope of avoiding substantial inventory impairments.  


Is Lowes transform old stock that CSTE were unable to sell, and is now being 


repackaged in the hope of avoiding inventory writedowns? 


13mm products sold as splashbacks, what are the cracking and heat fracture 


risks?
6. Increasing competition


CSTE’s understatement of the year: 


“We have also experienced instances of our competitors marketing products with 


similar appearances and similar model names to some of our products. 


Competition of this nature may increase in the markets in which we operate and 


may develop in new markets.24” 


Increased Competition 
The market is becoming significantly more competitive, with the following brands recently entering 


into competing with CSTE in the North Americas: 


 Arenastone


 Cimstone


 Diresco


 Hanstone


 Okite


 Quarella


 Quartz Compac


 Quantra (Pokarna Quartz)


 Stone Italiana


 Radianz by Samsung


 Technistone


 Trafficstone


 Unistone


 Vadara Quartz


 Vicostone


 Zodiaq by Dupont


In addition established players such as Pokarna Quartz have aspirations to expand their US footprint25 
26. 


These competitors have advantages over CSTE, be they input costs, cost of labour, FX benefits or 


quality claims. Based on CSTE’s projections and forecasts, they appear to be ignoring the bottom- and 


top-line risks including the carrying value of their ever-increasing inventory and finished goods.  


Competition is hotting up globally, with established producers increasingly competing for the same 


international market share. Examples being Cambria – a big US quartz manufacturing company moving 


24 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504379/000117891317000750/zk1719638.htm

investment  
26


 http://www.quantra.in/
into international markets27. “developing the strategic and operational structure for expanding sales, 


marketing and distribution of Cambria worldwide.”  


Vadara Quartz – another slab in the back for CSTE 
Mr Arik Tendler is the former CSTE USA CEO and accredited with the expansion and early development 


of the Company. The former USA division CEO also appears to be a reader of Spruce Point’s research. 


We speculate that Arik Tendler identified the issues and inferior levels of quartz in Spruce Point's 


previous report28.  


Mr Tendler is now CEO of Vadara Quartz29,30a relatively new brand within the quartz worktop market. 


Vadara appear to address quality issues Spruce Point have previously raised and that plague 


Caesarstone’s online reviews (cracking/chipping, staining31 & using chemicals32), which appear to be a 


deterrent to purchasing CSTE’s worktops. Vadara Quartz appears to have addressed concerns of 


consumers and tested their products to the following: 


Figure 9 Extract from Vadara Quartz Quality & Performance Claims 33 


Key Takeaways 
 If production is ramping up in CSTE’s new facility, where is the demand for this?


 Agents we have contacted suggest is that CSTE is not a quality product, and most prefer to


redirect us to other hard surface worktops.


 Some agents, despite being registered as suppliers/contact points to purchase CSTE products


either do not sell it (in some cases, have never sold it) or actually are registered distributors


and/or agents for other products.


 We believe CSTE wants to give the impression of a company with greater reach, depth and


market share than the reality.


 Arik Tendler, accredited with the development and expansion of CSTE, is now in direct


competition with Caesarstone.

7. SEC gets involved in ambiguous disclosures
On September 26 2016 the SEC issued a request for further information in order to clarify a number 


of ambiguous statements in the company’s 20-F34. 


While these requests are SEC filings attached to the CSTE ticker, they are nowhere to be found on 


CSTE’s “SEC Filings” section of their website.  


Management’s address of revenue variance factors do not correlate with our channel checks. 


Specifically, increased average selling prices do not reflect ground level pricing, which we have found 


to be decreasing, and excessive volume increases do not correspond to the consensus of CSTE resellers 


we contacted. 


The Average Selling Price & IKEA ambiguities 
The SEC questioned CSTE's revenue variance35. 


Figure 10 – SEC Query re ambiguity of revenue variance factors 


CSTE responded as follows36: 


Figure 11 – CSTE response to SEC Query re ambiguity of revenue variance factors

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504379/000117891316006696/filename1.htm
The following year’s 20-F provided insight into various metrics which we address below: 


Figure 12 – 2016 Revenue Movement concerns 


Forecasting, Competition 
With increased competition, margin pressures and a sales network that needs serious updating, it’s 


no wonder CSTE are the subject of SEC enquiries relating to the inherent risks in their forecasts37. 


CSTE’s financial forecasting is akin to holding their finger in the wind.  


Increased Volume? 
The consensus from the resellers we have contacted is that CSTE is not a quality product, and many 


prefer to redirect us to other hard surface worktops. We actively saw merchants moving away from 


this product. How is it that the largest portion of CSTE’s FY 2016 growth was driven by increased 


volumes? 


Increased Average Selling Price? 
Our comprehensive channel checks showed no increase in the prices of CSTE products at over the last 


two years. In fact, a review of Ikea’s catalogue shows that stock prices are generally decreasing38, 39 


Figure 13 – IKEA Sektion price list – FY 2015

df
Unfavourable movements to the AUD & CAD? 
Canada and Australia make up approximately 40% of CSTE’s revenue, or c. $215m. This end figure was 


negatively impacted by forex movement to the tune of ~ 18%. We question  the implication that 


volume has offset an 18% move in forex. We have already expressed our reservations on CSTE’s 


alleged volume growth: 


Figure 17 – Segment revenue
8. IKEA: Caesarstone’s high-margin cannibalisation
Our extensive channel checks identified that CSTE’s IKEA offerings are also offered by independent 


contractors, only IKEA’s prices their stock at a 18%-35% discount to CSTE contractors’ retail price. 


The contractor price list 
A USA based CSTE agent was kind enough to provide a copy of his retail price list of CSTE stock, as 


follows: 


Figure 18 – Reseller retail price list


The IKEA Sektion catalogue 
Note that many of the above listed designs are also available at Ikea:40

df
Figure 19 – IKEA Sektion catalogue 


Despite being identical products, IKEA’s buyer catalogue is between 18% and 35% cheaper than the 


regular CSTE agent’s retail price, and includes installation!41

df
Figure 20 – IKEA Sektion quartz price list 


The consequence 
This business model raises two revenue cannibalisation issues that benefit everyone except 


Caesarstone. 


The first obvious issue is: who would (willingly) pay a premium price for an identical product, given 


the choice (especially an IKEA product)? The answer is “no one”. Consumers will obviously opt for the 


low margin, extremely cheap IKEA product. 


Secondly, resellers are increasingly discouraged to sell CSTE products, opting instead for a higher 


margin, premium products.  


The first obvious issue is: who would pay a premium price for an identical product,

9. Silicosis – cost of doing business


The elephant in the room 


Silicosis liabilities have a significant range of assumption issues, on the one hand the company made 


provisions for the legal action to date, after insurance of circa $19M. So far there had been no 


provisions for the class-action suit that was filed in 2014 (circa $56M) , the progress of this case is 


unknown to date. 42 


Prudence dictates that these legal claims should be risked into any price target going forward. 43 CSTE 


discreetly mention that “Consistent with the experience of other companies involved in silica-related 


litigation, there may be an increase in the number of asserted claims against us.”

10. Caesarstone vs. Silestone – financial comparison
A comparative financial analysis against Silestone (a.k.a. Cosentino) reinforces our belief that 


Caesarstone’s financial statements are misrepresented. Specifically: 


 Caesarstone’s marketing expenses are remarkably low considering they allege to have over


10 times as many distributors in the USA as Silestone.


 Caesarstone’s maintenance capex spending is substantially lower than Silestone’s, despite


CSTE’s higher revenues and COGS.


 Silestone’s margins are 20% higher, suggesting less volume sold per unit of revenue and


therefore lower wear & tear machinery expenses.


 All quartz machinery (incl. frequent wear & tear replacement parts) are bought from niche


group of suppliers with limited price variance44.


We believe that CSTE is either not properly maintaining its assets, or overstating its sales volume and 


revenue while PPE remains underutilized.  


Unlevered modelling exercise 
In order to make a fair comparison, we have derived unlevered operational cash-flows for both 


businesses over a 5-year period - CSTE ending in FY 2016, Silestone ending FY 2015 as FY 2016 results 


have not yet been released.  


In order to remove the effects of growth, we have estimated maintenance capex as the D&A recorded 


for the given year. This is fundamentally the value of the assets that will have to be replaced in order 


for the businesses to continue its operations.  


This analysis highlights what was already apparent at first glance of the accounts: Caesarstone's free 


cash flow is inexplicably and illogically better than its competitors. Note that while we have modelled 


in CSTE’s lower tax rate, this does not  affect our comparative analysis conclusions. 


Marketing Expenses 
CSTE’s marketing expenses have averaged around 13% of revenues over the last four years. We 


derived marketing expenses from Silestone’s account by way of elimination45, which appear to be in 


the region of 20% of their revenue over the last 2 years. In any case, Silestone have much higher OPEX 


overall per Figure 21 below46. 


As mentioned through this report, CSTE has over 10 times more distributors than Silestone. CSTE’s 


marketing expenses do not reflect this enormous client upkeep with a maintenance cost consequence. 


This was reflected in our channel checks where a numerous CSTE’s listed agents simply did not sell the 


product.

45 Salaries accounted for, only other costs could be admin, which, given high salaries, are presumably done in 
house and thus would not be recognised as “External Services”. 
46 Silestone FY 2014 Financial Statements. Note: Note: we were unable to retrieve full financial statements for 
FY 2015, only raw financial data sourced from S&P Capital IQ.
Figure 21 – Silestone (Cosentino) Financial Statements FY 2014 


Maintenance Capex 
As a prelude: all quartz manufacturers buy their machinery from a limited number of manufacturers 


and suppliers which are niche to the industry. Industry experts and competitors have advised that 


these machines suffer a measurable amount of wear and tear with parts requiring replacement after 


a given “mileage” (think of tread on car tires). It is therefore reasonable to assume that CSTE’s 


depreciation and maintenance capex schedule would be very similar to its competitors. It is not.  


Note that we are discussing maintenance capex, not any other type of acquisition or expansion based 


investment outflows, examples of which can be seen over Figures 22 & 23.
Figure 22 – CSTE FY 2015 Financial Statements 


Figure 23 – CSTE FY 2016 Financial Statements 


Our analysis removed the capital structure effects on the business, transaction costs, minority interest 


earnings, and one-time costs. The results can be found on the next the page and are labelled Figures 


24 & 25. 


EBITDA Margins 
Readers should also note that Silestone’s EBITDA margins have also declined by over 6 percentage 


points over the last 5 years, reflecting the increasingly competitive market in which it operates. 


Despite having substantially lower gross margins (almost 20 percentage points!), CSTE’s EBITDA has 


grown in the midst of competition and has overtaken Cosentino’s margins!  


This means CSTE had to make up more than 20 percentage points of revenue in savings from marketing 


or staff cuts just to make up the proportional COGS difference between the two.
NOTE: CSTE figures are in USD, Cosentino figures are in EUR

Comparison to actual figures 
Cosentino spent c. €33.5m (US$43m, assuming a conservative €1 = US$1.3) on PPE in FY 2014. 


Cosentino did not expand its operations in 2014.   


Figure 26 – Cosentino FY 2014 Statement of cash flows extract 


Cosentino’s sales in FY 2014 were €291m, or US$378m
In 2016, which was a non-expansionary year for CSTE, it spent a mere US$23m on PPE: 


Figure 27 – CSTE FY 2016 Statement of cash flows extract 


As a means of comparison, consider the following: 


 CSTE’s FY 2016 revenue was US$538m, against US$378m by Silestone in FY 2014.


 CSTE’s gross margin was 39%, compared to Silestone’s 57%.


Given all the machinery and frequent wear and tear parts are provided by, fitted and maintained by a 


limited number of niche suppliers with limited cost variables, it is reasonable to presume that : 


 Cost per unit of volume sold in both factories are the roughly the same


 Silestone’s higher margin suggests less sales volume is required per US$1 of revenue.


 Silestone’s would be expected to require less maintenance costs associated with wear and


tear


We note that the suppliers for the equipment are based in the Euro zone, however even the 


appreciation of the USD does not compensate for this massive discrepancy.  


We have no idea how CSTE can spend so little on its CAPEX; but we can hazard a guess. We believe 


maintenance is down because production is down, either that or CSTE is failing to maintain its 


machines in good order. 


Both are equally damning. 


We believe the SEC are similarly suspicious on CSTE’s incredible margins and low maintenance capex. 


It issued a  letter on 26 September 2016 asking why US production lines and Israel production lines 


are aggregated into a single reporting segment, reducing visibility on utilisation of each plant47: 


47 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1504379/000000000016094507/filename1.pdf
Figure 28 – SEC Letter Extract – September 26 2016 


We believe it would be prudent for the SEC to persist in this matter, as the financial evidence suggests 


that it is not feasible for CSTE to achieve their reported results. We believe transparency into CSTE’s 


reportable segments would ultimately prove our thesis.
Figure 32 – CSTE market penetration in key markets 


Consider the following 
You could calculate CSTE’s alleged 14% quartz penetration in the USA backwards. CSTE's North 


American revenue should be as follows according to Freedonia data: 


$96,000𝑚 𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 𝑆𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 ×  15% 𝑄𝑢𝑎𝑟𝑡𝑧 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑐𝑒 × 26% 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ 𝐴𝑚. 𝑆𝑒𝑔𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 


×  14% 𝐶𝑆𝑇𝐸 𝑈𝑆 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 = $524𝑚 


$524m is 97% of total revenues in FY 2016, and 70% more than CSTE’s reported 


North American segment revenue of $308m.  


The pie charts provided by management separate geographies and countertop type demands based 


on volume, not revenue. However if we were to translate these pie charts into revenue, we would 


expect that: 


 Premium countertop materials (Granite, Marble and Quartz) would be more heavily weighed


than non-premium products (laminate, solid surface, other), as premium products are


obviously more expensive. For example, where Quartz represents 15% of countertops by


volume, we would expect it to represent >15% by revenue.


 Developed geographies would be more heavily weighted than less-developed geographies.


For example, we would expect a countertop to be more expensive in North America than in


Latin America or Asia. Therefore North America’s demand distribution of revenue would be


greater than its distribution of volume (i.e. >26%)


North America/Granite would have a larger revenues relative to volumes, making 


our calculations conservative. 


We back tested these calculations using Australian geographical data. CSTE’s Australian segment 


comprises 24.3% of total revenue, with market volume comprising (allegedly) 2% of global demand 


and where they claim to have 45% market penetration. Therefore:  


45% ∗ 2%


24.3%
= 𝐺𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙  𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑟𝑒𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑢𝑒𝑠 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 1% 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑖𝑟 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 = 0.037 


0.037 ∗ (41.3% + 15.9%) = 𝐶𝑆𝑇𝐸 𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ 𝐴𝑚. 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 𝑎𝑠 % 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 𝑠𝑎𝑙𝑒𝑠 = 2.116% 


2.116%


26% (𝑁𝑜𝑟𝑡ℎ 𝐴𝑚. % 𝑜𝑓 𝑔𝑙𝑜𝑏𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑒𝑚𝑎𝑛𝑑)
=  𝟖. 𝟏𝟒% 𝒎𝒂𝒓𝒌𝒆𝒕 𝒑𝒆𝒏𝒆𝒕𝒓𝒂𝒕𝒊𝒐𝒏 𝒊𝒏 𝑼𝑺𝑨
CSTE alleges 14% market penetration in North America. 


Whilst this calculation does not consider countertop material preference by geography or even by 


volume, it would certainly be a stretch to say that the product mix of surfaces in Australia is so 


substantially different to that of the USA, as the calculation is derived from Australian figures.  


The mismatch speaks volumes. We believe either: 


- CSTE’s performance is not correlated to the global market in which case the data is useless. 


- CSTE’s market penetration figures are inflated in which case the data is wrong 


Year-on-year quartz growth 
The surface demand mix increase yoy for quartz countertops appears extreme considering that: 


 There was an obvious recommendation and sales data channel checked countertop fitters


which suggest a preference towards granite or quartz.


 Granite and quartz are the same price


While Quartz surface has grown in the product mix by 50% since 2014, granite’s mix has stayed flat:  


Figure 33 – 2014 Global countertop demand by type 


Figure 34 – 2016 Global countertop demand by type
Key takeaways 
We believe Freedonia’s marketing material is a redundant exercise, and the SEC should seek more 


clarity into: 


 Verification of CSTE’s geographical segment data


 Authentication of CSTE’s market research data

13. Conclusion
Due to the irregularities displayed in CSTE’s accounts, we have not derived a target price, as we 


would have incorporated too many assumptions.
