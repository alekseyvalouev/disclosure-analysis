Shares Out:  45.8M    Market Cap: $2.3B      FYE Dec 
Concept: 
1. Office furniture demand appears to be in secular decline, and also appears to be nearing a 
cyclical peak. Expectations that HNI’s office furniture revenues will re-accelerate over multiple 
years seem unlikely to be met.
2 


2. HNI management’s suggestion that margins will expand to new highs may be unrealistic. 
Gross margins are driven by raw material prices, which are now increasing. SG&A has de-
levered over multiple economic cycles.  
3. Earnings quality appears poor. Over the TTM period, FCF has represented only 55% of non-
GAAP earnings. HNI’s accounting may be too aggressive and seems open to question.  
 
Summary: HNI Corp (HNI) is one of the largest US manufacturers of office 
furniture, which it sells primarily under the HON and AllSteel brands. The 
company sells to furniture dealers, wholesalers, and office retailers like Staples and 
Office Depot. Roughly half of its office furniture sales are through the “contract” 
channel, where furniture dealers bid on a specific project, while the other half is 
sold into the “supplies driven” channel, where visibility is lower. Office furniture 
accounted for 77% of HNI’s TTM sales and 65% of pre-corporate EBIT. Hearth 
products (i.e. fireplaces and stoves) accounts for the remainder. Our investment 
thesis focuses on the Office segment.  
 
 HNI bulls view the stock as a “play” on corporate capital investment, 
thinking that rising business confidence will soon translate into increased demand 
for office furniture. This would represent a change from the current trend. In 
September 2016, HNI pre-announced weak 3Q16 results: 3Q16 sales fell -5% Y/Y 
(versus guidance of 0%-3% growth) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 (-14% Y/Y) 
missed guidance of $0.93. The company blamed this on “overall softer than 
anticipated demand.” HNI’s share price subsequently fell from $52 to $37.           
 
 However, since the US election, HNI shares have regained all their lost 
ground, and trade above $50. HNI management has suggested that revenue growth 
in the Office Furniture segment will re-accelerate and compound at 4%-5% p.a. 
through 2020, with 25% incremental operating margins. Buoyed by high 
expectations for corporate investment post-election, investors appear to give 
credence to these bullish claims: on a price-to-sales basis, HNI trades near a 10-
year high.   
 
 These bullish expectations seem unlikely to be met. First, US office furniture 
demand appears to be in secular decline. This has been driven primarily by a shift 
from cubicle-style personal workspaces to more “open format” space with 
communal seating, which reduces square-footage-per-employee by as much as 
75%. At the same time, furniture spend per square foot is declining, as businesses 
reduce storage requirements and introduce open tables without drawers and 
dividers. All told, based on our analysis of CoStar data, we estimate that furniture 
spending per employee declined roughly -13% from 2007 to 2016 and is still 
falling, as we will discuss further.  
 
 Second, US office furniture demand appears to be nearing a cyclical peak. 
Growth in “professional and business services” payrolls (i.e. the white collar jobs
3 


that drive office furniture spending) is decelerating as the US approaches full 
employment. Recent JOLTS data suggests that growth in white-collar job 
openings, a leading indicator for employment growth, has also slowed.    
 
 In recent months, net absorption of office space has slowed, as new 
deliveries have come on line in an environment of slowing demand growth. Jones 
Lang LaSalle projects that new office completions will peak in 2017. Within the 
existing office stock, total leasing activity (which drives furniture demand, since 
companies usually buy new furniture when they move) also appears to be slowing. 
JLL estimates that US gross leasing volumes dropped by -6.7% Y/Y in 2016 and 
are projected to be flat this year, despite the higher Y/Y deliveries of new office 
inventory. As we discuss, below, our fieldwork also supports the notion that 
leasing activity and demand for office furniture is slowing.  
 
 Consensus projections imply that HNI can achieve non-GAAP operating 
margins of ~10% by 2018 (up from 8.5% in the TTM period), which would be 
higher than the previous cyclical peak OPM of 9% achieved in the 2003-05 period 
(a time when HNI was benefiting from a housing boom in its higher-margin hearth 
segment).  
 


We think such margin expansion is unlikely to materialize. First, raw 
materials, primarily steel, account for two-thirds of COGS, and prices are now 
rising sharply (e.g. at $630 per short ton, US hot rolled steel prices are up +58% 
Y/Y). By comparison, between 2005-07 (a period of similar Y/Y increases in raw 
material pricing) HNI’s GPM declined by -110bps despite +5% top line growth. 
Second, as we discuss below, SG&A expense has de-levered during multiple 
economic cycles. Barring acceleration in top-line growth, margin expansion on the 
SG&A line through cost cutting and productivity improvements should be difficult 
to achieve.  


 
In addition, HNI’s reported income statement margins and earnings appear 


to bear little relation to actual cash profit generation. HNI generated only 
$1.48/share of sustainable FCF over the TTM period, compared to $2.70 in 
reported non-GAAP EPS. Quality of earnings appears poor, and HNI’s accounting 
seems aggressive. CapEx has far exceeded D&A for the past three years (e.g. 
$87MM for the TTM period vs. $64MM D&A), despite the fact that the company 
has been reducing capacity and closing down manufacturing facilities.  


 
At the same time, since 2012, HNI has been capitalizing expenses related to 


an ERP implementation and various (and vaguely defined) “business systems 
transformation” initiatives, but has repeatedly held off from amortizing these 
capitalized expenses, which totaled $29MM in the TTM period (or $0.44/share 
after tax), and now amount to $144MM (or $2.19 per share) on the balance sheet.
4 


The company originally said it would begin amortizing these in 2014 or 2015, but 
now appears to be telling investors that amortization will begin sometime in 2017 
(and will be done over an abnormally long 10-year depreciable life). Interestingly, 
we note that HNI sacked its auditor in 2015, and, at the same time, shuffled its 
audit committee, which now appears to include only one member (a 19-year board 
veteran) with accounting experience.  


 
Overall, HNI’s approach to cost capitalization seems very aggressive, and, 


given that aggressiveness, it is notable that the company has increased its total 
FY16 CapEx guidance substantially throughout the course of 2016 (from 
$105MM-$110MM a year ago, to $130MM-$135MM today), which it had not 
done in prior years. This accounting has the potential to increase reported earnings, 
but it is also open to question. We will discuss HNI’s accounting, below.     


 
As noted, following HNI’s pre-announcement of weak 3Q16 results, shares 


fell to $37. We think that, if investors begin to question the bull case regarding 
HNI’s top line growth, and, importantly, if investors begin to seriously question the 
quality of reported earnings, HNI’s share price is likely to return to much lower 
levels. Our $35 price target represents a 0.75x price-to-sales multiple against our 
projected 2018 revenues of $2.1B, which is the middle of the range in which HNI 
has traded over the past 10 years. Our $35 price target also represents a 16.2x 
multiple of our 2018 earnings projection of $2.17.  HNI currently sells at a 14.8x 
multiple of consensus 2018 EPS of $3.41, so there might be additional downside to 
our price target.

Background:  
 
 HNI Corp. (HNI), headquartered in Muscatine, Iowa, is one of the largest 
US manufacturers of office furniture, and is also the largest US manufacturer of 
hearth and fireplace products. Over the TTM period ending Sep-30, the Office 
Furniture segment accounted for 77% of total HNI revenues and 65% of pre-
corporate EBIT, while the Hearth segment accounted for the remainder.  
 
 Figure 1, below, shows HNI’s annual revenues by segment since 1998. Note 
that the company has spent $667MM on acquisitions over this time period.

Figure 2, below, shows the progression of HNI’s total organic revenues 
since 1998, based on the Y/Y% organic growth figures disclosed in the company’s 
10-K filings. It appears that organic revenues are currently almost -8% below their 
1998 level (in nominal $ terms), suggesting that organic revenues have 
compounded at a slightly negative rate over the past two decades. This supports the 
notion (which we discuss below) that the office furniture market is in secular 
decline.

 HNI says that revenues from its Office Furniture segment are split roughly 
50/50 between the “contract” and “supplies driven” channels. “Contract” sales are 
typically made to larger customers, who put out an RFP to furniture dealers. 
“Supplies driven” sales have a shorter lead time and typically don’t involve a 
bidding process.  
 


Market share in the higher-end “contract” furniture business is split across 
the “big 5” players: the publicly traded furniture companies (MLHR, KNOL, SCS, 
and HON), plus Teknion. These “contract” sales are typically made through 
furniture dealers who strike an exclusive distribution relationship with a single 
primary vendor. Each major metro area tends to have a single dealer that represents 
each of the main manufacturers, and these dealers bid against one another for 
contract jobs.  


 
By contrast, the “supplies driven” channel caters to smaller businesses that 


typically would not put out an RFP for furniture. In this channel, HNI sells to large 
wholesalers (e.g. Essendant and SP Richards), plus national retailers with a 
network of B2B sales offices, such as Staples and Office Depot.  


 
The lower-end “supplies driven” channel is much more fragmented than the 


“contract” business. HNI claims to have 20%-30% market share, with the #2 
player, Global Furniture Group, holding roughly ~15% share. Haworth is another 
large player in the “supplies driven” market, but the remainder is split across a 
multitude of niche players.      
 
 In the “contract” business, HNI sells primarily under the AllSteel brand. 
Based on our discussions with industry participants, among the “big 5,” it appears 
that AllSteel (i.e. HNI) and Teknion are generally considered “second-tier” brands, 
while Herman Miller, Steelcase, and Knoll are viewed as “premium” brands. In the 
“supplies driven” channel, HNI sells primarily under the HON brand.    
 
 “Systems and storage” (i.e. desks, cubicles, file cabinets) accounted for 64% 
of HNI’s 2015 Office Furniture sales. “Seating” accounted for 32%, and “Other” 
products accounted for the remaining 4%. We note that, since 2010 (when HNI 
first started disclosing this information), the mix of “systems and storage” revenues 
has dropped from 71% to 64%, due to secular shifts in the consumption of office 
furniture (which we discuss below). 
 
 Turnaround time in HNI’s office furniture business is short: product is 
typically manufactured and shipped within “a few weeks” of order receipt. As 
such, visibility appears to be relatively limited.
7 


HNI and its competitors manufacture domestically. Except at the very low 
end, office furniture must be manufactured in the US (or at least assembled in the 
US) because it is not economic to ship pre-assembled furniture from overseas, and 
business customers (unlike IKEA shoppers) typically will not assemble their own 
furniture. As of Dec-31-2015, HNI had 10.7MM square feet of total manufacturing 
space (the majority of which was dedicated to office furniture), of which it owned 
9.1MM square feet. Roughly ~8% of Office Furniture sales are from non-US 
sources, and these are manufactured abroad.  


 
Raw materials account for roughly two-thirds of furniture COGS. The key 


raw materials are steel, aluminum, and wood products. 78% of HNI’s inventories 
are recorded under the LIFO method and it does not appear that the company has 
historically hedged its raw material pricing.  
 
 According to HNI, roughly ~50% of sales in the Hearth segment is driven by 
new home construction. Roughly 40% is driven by retrofit of existing homes (i.e. 
addition / replacement of fireplaces), while pellet stoves account for ~10% of 
Hearth segment sales.   
 
 Operating margins (before corporate level expenses) have averaged roughly 
~7% in the furniture business and ~9% in the hearth business over the long term, 
with relatively large cyclical swings. Figures 3 and 4, below, show historical 
(GAAP) OPM by segment, through FY 2015. We discuss HNI’s margins in more 
detail, below.

Discussion: 
 
1. The US office furniture market appears to be in secular decline.  
 
 According to BIFMA, the industry body, total US consumption of office 
furniture remains below its late 90’s peak. Even in nominal dollar terms, adjusting 
for cyclical swings, it appears the overall market hasn’t grown in 20 years. See 
Figure 5, below. 
 
Figure 5. US office furniture consumption ($B) 


 
Source: BIFMA, OWS 
 
 In real, inflation-adjusted terms, US office furniture consumption is down 
roughly 33% since peaking in 2000. Figure 6, below, adjusts the BIFMA numbers 
for inflation (using the US GDP deflator). The secular decline is rather clear.
9 


 
Figure 6. Inflation-adjusted US office furniture consumption (in 2009 dollars) 


 
Source: BIFMA, OWS 
 
 The secular decline has been driven by a number of factors. First, since the 
early 2000s, there has been a broad trend away from cubicle-style personal 
workspaces and toward more “open format” space with communal seating. The 
new style office space looks like Figure 7, below. In many cases, we are told that 
companies are forgoing assigned seating entirely. Since a portion of the employee 
base tends to be traveling or working from home at any given time, this further 
increases utilization of seats (i.e. there are fewer empty chairs and work spaces).
10 


Figure 7. “Open format” seating (source: Herman Miller catalog)

The attraction for employers is that personal space-per-employee can be 
reduced by as much as 75%, as employees are shifted from a 6’ x 6’ cubicle to a 2’ 
x 4’ bench space. According to interior architects with whom we spoke, 250 square 
feet per employee (including common areas, etc.) used to be the rule of thumb. 
Now, spaces in the low 100 square foot range are common, and some of the most 
aggressive designs specify as little as 85 square feet per employee.    


 
The impact of this shift can be seen in the numbers. Figure 8, below, shows 


the change in white-collar employees, occupied square footage, and furniture 
spend, from 2007-2016. Since 2007 (the last peak in the employment cycle), the 
number of white-collar employees in the US has increased by +14%. However, 
based on our analysis of CoStar data, it appears that occupied office square footage 
has increased by only +6% over the same time period.
11 


Figure 8. Change in employees, space, furniture consumption (2007=1.00) 


 
Employees = “Professional and business service employees” from monthly OES survey (source: BLS). 
Occupied square feet is sourced from OWS analysis of CoStar data. 
Furniture spend is based on BIFMA data.  
 


Note that this occupied square footage number is likely overstated, since 
industry participants tell us that the amount of so-called “shadow space” (i.e. 
square footage that is leased but actually sits unoccupied) has increased 
substantially since 2007.  


 
Looking at the numbers in a different way, Figure 9, below, shows the trend 


in occupied square footage per employee since 1999. This analysis is based on data 
from Reis. Note the decline in square footage per worker appears to have 
accelerated since the last recession. This accords with our discussions with 
industry participants, who suggest that the “open format” trend started accelerating 
around 2009. According to these contacts, we are now well into the “mainstream 
adoption” phase of the open format trend.
12 


Figure 9. Occupied square feet per office worker (source: Reis) 


 
Source: OWS analysis of Reis data 
 
 At the same time that square footage per employee has been dropping, 
furniture spend per square foot has also declined. This is caused by two major 
factors. First, the reduction of employees’ personal space and the move toward the 
“paperless office” has markedly reduced storage requirements. Instead of a desk 
with drawers and/or a file cabinet, the typical office worker is now often provided 
with just a single 2’ by 2’ pavilion that can double as a seat. See Figure 10, below. 
 
Figure 10. Storage pavilions

13 


 
 In addition to reduced storage requirements, the general aesthetic trend has 
been toward less “stuff” per square foot. Even in private offices (which have been 
shrinking in number), there has been a move toward open work tables and less 
furniture overall, and away from the old style heavy desks with lots of shelving and 
bookcases. Figure 11, below, shows an example of this trend from Knoll’s 
“Antenna” line of private offices. According to industry participants, the overall 
trend toward less “stuff” per square foot has been reducing the average ticket for 
office furniture. 
 
Figure 11. Private office design  


 
Source: Knoll  
 
 Ultimately, based on our discussions with industry participants, it appears 
that the changes causing a secular decline in office furniture demand aren’t driven 
by a design fad so much as by a fundamental change in the way people work. The 
emergence of smartphones, ubiquitous Wi-Fi, and cloud-based storage and file 
access, appear to have created a truly “mobile” white-collar workforce, and this 
mobility means a shift away from the concept of “personal space” in the office, 
since workers are no longer tethered to a single physical spot. As a result, square 
footage in the office is transforming from “dedicated” to “undedicated” space.   
 


Businesses are still spending on amenities to attract high quality employees, 
we are told, but this spending is shifting away from furniture and toward perks like 
espresso machines, food, nicer laptops, etc. Of course, this represents a shift in 
spending away from HNI and other furniture manufacturers.
14 


 According to furniture industry contacts, even those businesses that 
transitioned entirely to open, communal benches, and later discovered that it 
provided insufficient private space for workers, are responding not by reverting to 
older designs, but by adding phone call “cubbies” and shared quiet rooms where 
employees can retreat to engage in deep work. This supports the notion that 
declining personal space per worker likely represents a cultural shift rather than a 
design fad. It does not appear likely that the secular downtrend in furniture spend 
per worker or per square foot will reverse any time soon.  
 
 We can see this cultural change embodied in two additional trends. First, the 
number of employees working from home is growing rapidly. Precise data is hard 
to come by, but, according to Global Workplace Analytics, a consultancy, 3.7MM 
US workers (2.8% of the labor force) now works from home at least 50% of the 
time. This number has doubled since 2005 and in recent years has grown at 2x the 
pace of total payrolls growth. See here: 
http://globalworkplaceanalytics.com/telecommuting-statistics. Note this data is 
only updated through 2014, so it is unclear whether this trend is accelerating now 
that smartphones have been in widespread use for several years.  
 
 The other, more visible trend is the growth of co-working spaces. According 
to CoStar data, WeWork alone took down 2.1MM square feet of space in New 
York between it’s founding in 2010 and 2015. To put that number in context, total 
net absorption of office space in NY totaled 13.7MM square feet over the same 
time period, according to Reis. In 4Q16 alone, according to CBRE, WeWork 
leased an additional 200K square feet in midtown Manhattan (which would have 
made it the #3 largest lessor in that market during the quarter). It is difficult to 
quantify how much space is being taken up by the mushrooming number of 
WeWork copycats and competitors.  
 
 The important thing to note is that co-working spaces generally do not 
purchase traditional office furniture. Instead, most co-working spaces, including 
WeWork, furnish their spaces with cheaper product from retailers like IKEA and 
West Elm. Therefore, to the extent that office space utilization shifts to a co-
working format, it should reduce the total available market for office furniture 
vendors like HNI.  
 
2. US office furniture demand appears to be nearing a cyclical peak.  
 


Office furniture consumption is driven by two factors. The first factor is net 
absorption of office space to accommodate more workers. The second factor is the 
total volume of leasing activity and associated move-ins / move-outs, since 
businesses typically buy new furniture when they move to a new space. Our
15 


research suggests that both of these factors are near a cyclical peak and may now 
be slowing.   


 
First, growth in “professional and business services” payrolls (i.e. the white 


collar jobs that drive office furniture spending) is decelerating as the US 
approaches full employment. See Figure 12, below.  


 
Figure 12. Y/Y% growth in “Professional and business services” payrolls 


 
Source: BLS, OWS 


 
At the same time, recent JOLTS data suggests that growth in white-collar 


job openings, a leading indicator for employment growth, has also slowed, and has 
now gone negative on a Y/Y basis. See Figure 13, below.
16 


Figure 13. JOLTS job openings – “Professional and business services” 
Black line = 6mo moving average 
 


 
Source: BLS, OWS 
 
 Unless there is a large stock of potential white collar workers that have not 
yet re-entered the labor force, which seems unlikely, employment growth should 
continue to decelerate, reducing the net absorption of office space and associated 
tailwind to furniture demand.      
 
 Indeed, in recent months, net absorption of office space has slowed, as new 
deliveries have come on line in an environment of slowing demand growth. Figure 
14, below, shows the rolling 4Q average of net absorption across the total US 
market, according to Reis data. It appears 1Q16 might have marked peak net 
absorption for this economic cycle.
17 


Figure 14. US office space net absorption – 4Q rolling average (sq. ft. millions) 


  
Source: Reis, OWS 
 
 The second cyclical factor that drives furniture demand, the volume of 
leasing and associated move-ins / move-outs within the existing office stock (i.e. 
gross absorption), also appears to be slowing.  
 


According to Jones Lang LaSalle, US gross leasing volumes (in square 
footage terms) were down -6.7% Y/Y in 2016, and are projected to be 
approximately flat Y/Y in 2017. This is despite the fact that new office 
completions are projected (by both JLL and Reis) to increase Y/Y and peak in 
2017, before declining in 2018. 
 


This macro projection is supported by our own extensive fieldwork. Over 
the past month, we spoke and/or visited with commercial tenant brokers, furniture 
dealers, and interior architects in the following markets: Boston, New York, 
Washington DC, Atlanta, Miami, Houston, Austin, Dallas, Chicago, Denver, Los 
Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle.  
 
 Our fieldwork indicates that gross leasing volumes since approximately 
~2012 have been driven primarily by large corporations consolidating their 
operations within a single location and/or building out private campuses. This is 
often referred to as “build to suit” development. Our discussions with commercial 
tenant brokers in particular make clear that so-called “whales” (i.e. very large 
tenants taking down square footage in 100K to 1M range) have accounted for the 
bulk of their own business in recent years, and that leasing activity among smaller 
tenants has been declining.
18 


 
 Take Dallas for example. According to Reis, the office vacancy rate in the 
Dallas metro area has remained elevated, hovering in the low 20% range for the 
past decade (by comparison, the total US vacancy rate is currently 16%). 
Nevertheless, Dallas has been one of the strongest US markets for commercial 
office construction throughout the current economic expansion.  
 


This strength appears to have been due mainly to high levels of “build to 
suit” activity in Dallas over the past 4-5 years. For example, Toyota, State Farm, 
Liberty Mutual, Schwab, Verizon, Perot Systems, Facebook, and Capital One, 
have all either recently completed major “build to suit” projects or are set to 
complete them in 2017.  


 
However, as one contact in Dallas told us, “We’ve enjoyed a 7-year run with 


massive build-to-suit” projects, but “this will be hard to maintain . . . a lot of the 
big deals [in Dallas] have already been done.” This contact noted that activity 
“started to slow down” in 4Q16. 


 
 This was consistent with the discussions we had with brokers and other 
industry participants across the major metro markets we surveyed. In general, the 
majority of brokers we spoke with were not enthusiastic about the prospects for 
leasing velocity over the next 1-2 years. These contacts typically noted the relative 
lack of “big scores” (as they called them) on the horizon relative to the level of 
activity maintained over the prior few years.  
 


The two markets we surveyed where brokers generally expected 2017 
leasing volumes to be higher than 2016 were San Francisco and Seattle, but this 
was generally based on expectations that more mega-sized leases would be signed.  


 
In New York, our conversations indicated that, despite a low vacancy rate  


(< 10%), leasing activity is expected to remain muted. One broker contact noted 
that Time Warner, which is set to consolidate its 7 Manhattan locations into a 
single headquarters at Hudson Yards, only did so because Related Companies 
(which owns both the Hudson Yards development and TW’s current headquarters) 
agreed to buy TW out of its current location in Columbus Circle. This contact 
suggested that the fact Related Companies needed to provide a “carrot” to secure 
its own “whale” anchor tenant (by poaching them from one of its own properties, 
to boot) is symptomatic of a general weakness in leasing demand. 


 
All told, it appears that the trend of “whales” building out new headquarters 


and/or consolidating their locations into a single space, is now mature and the 
cycle may be declining. With leasing activity among smaller tenants still in decline 
(according to industry participants), unless there is a re-acceleration in the pace of
19 


“build-to-suit” activity, it seems that gross leasing volumes, and the associated 
demand for office furniture, should continue to decline over the next 2-3 years.  
 
3. Increased competition may be pressuring office furniture manufacturers like 
HNI.  
 
 Several of HNI’s publicly traded competitors have noted increasing 
competition in the market and aggressiveness on pricing in recent quarters. For 
example, on its Dec-21 earnings call, Steelcase (SCS) noted, “We’re just facing 
increased competition in the [day-to-day, shorter lead time] segment of our dealers 
business.” On Dec-22, Herman Miller noted the “competitive pricing 
environment.”  
 
 Increasing competition was also a theme mentioned on multiple occasions 
throughout the course of our field research. For example, one large office furniture 
dealer in Los Angeles told us that he was getting “three calls a day” from niche 
players looking for him to carry their product. He noted that Asian competitors had 
recently starting building out assembly and distribution infrastructure in California 
to provide the required level of product availability to gain access to more dealers’ 
catalogs.  
 
 Another contact, a sales rep at a “big 5” furniture showroom in Miami, also 
suggested that his business was under pressure from new entrants, in this case at 
the higher end of the market. He said that industry prices were declining as a result. 
 
 Some industry participants speculated that barriers to entry were falling 
because of the shift to “simpler” designs (e.g. flat work tables), but, although 
intuitively this seems likely, it’s not clear whether this is a significant issue. We 
plan to explore this issue further as we continue our fieldwork in the coming 
months.   
 
4. Expectations for margin expansion seem unlikely to be met.  
 


HNI management has suggested to investors that it can achieve 25% 
incremental operating margins on 4%-5% p.a. office furniture sales growth through 
2020. Consequently, consensus “street” projections imply that HNI can achieve 
total non-GAAP operating margins of ~10% by 2018 (up from 8.5% in the TTM 
period), which would be higher than the previous cyclical peak OPM of 9% 
achieved in the 2003-05 period (a time when HNI was benefiting from a housing 
boom in its higher-margin hearth segment).
20 


Figure 15, below, shows HNI’s non-GAAP operating margins since 1998, 
along with the non-GAAP OPM projections implied by “street” consensus (in 
green).  


 
Figure 15. Non-GAAP OPM (w. implied “street” projections in green)

We think such margin expansion seems unlikely to materialize.  
 
First, it appears that HNI has enjoyed a major tailwind to gross margins from 


the collapse in raw material prices from 2014-16. However, this tailwind should 
now turn into a headwind, as steel prices have rebounded sharply and are now up 
+58% Y/Y (clients can track US hot rolled coil steel prices using the Bloomberg 
ticker: MBST5274 Index). We note that, even since HNI management last spoke 
on its Oct-20 earnings call, US steel prices are up +34%.  


 
According to the company, raw materials, primarily steel, account for two-


thirds of COGS. Our analysis of historical changes in GPM supports the notion 
that raw material prices are a major driver. Figure 16, below, shows HNI’s annual 
GPM going back 20 years.
21 


Figure 16. HNI gross margins 


  
Source: Company filings, OWS 


 
There are several points to note from this chart. First, it is obvious that HNI 


has enjoyed a major tailwind to GPM from the unique 2014-16 combination of 
collapsing raw material prices and a stable economic environment (previous 
declines in raw material pricing have coincided with recessions). We note that, by 
comparison, Herman Miller (MLHR) and Steelcase (SCS) show a similar boom in 
GPM over the past two years, so this does not appear to be company specific to 
HNI.  


 
Second, HNI’s own historical trend supports the notion that changes in raw 


material prices are sufficient to trump the operating leverage impact from changes 
in sales. For example, between 2005 and 2007, a period when raw material prices 
were increasing sharply, HNI’s GPM declined by -110bps despite +5% top line 
growth. In 2009, despite a massive -33% Y/Y drop in sales, GPM increased by 
+100bps Y/Y, as HNI enjoyed a favorable raw material comparison against the 
“blow off top” steel pricing of early 2008. And from 2009-12, a period when 
revenues increased +23% but raw materials were rebounding from their post-2008 
lows, HNI’s GPM actually fell by -30bps.   


 
All told, we think it’s likely that increasing raw material prices could have a 


substantially negative impact on HNI’s gross margins in 2017-18.  
 
At the same time, HNI’s SG&A expense has de-levered during multiple 


economic cycles. Figure 17, below, shows the long-term historical trend. In the last 
cycle, SG&A bottomed in 2006 at just below 27% of sales. During this cycle, at
22 


least so far, SG&A bottomed in 2015 at 29% of sales (and has de-levered so far in 
2016 on falling sales). 


  
Figure 17. HNI - SG&A % of sales (GAAP) 


 
Source: Company filings, OWS 


 
HNI’s historical track record suggests that, barring acceleration in top-line 


growth, margin expansion on the SG&A line through cost cutting and productivity 
improvements should be difficult to achieve.  
 
5. Quality of earnings appears poor. HNI’s accounting may be aggressive and 
seems open to question. 
 


The margin discussion, above, notwithstanding, HNI’s reported income 
statement margins and earnings appear to bear little relation to actual cash profit 
generation. This seems to be due mainly to persistent and substantial amounts of 
cost capitalization. See Table 1, below.
23

       * Mgmt FY16 guidance = $130MM-$135MM in total CapEx & cap. software 
** FCF = NI + D&A - CapEx 


     Source: Company filings, OWS 
 


First, HNI’s CapEx has exceeded D&A by wide margins over the past 
several years. This is despite the fact that the company appears to be reducing and 
consolidating its manufacturing capacity, and has been closing down 
manufacturing facilities. We understand that HNI has been telling investors that 
the high CapEx is driven by investment for “productivity improvements” within 
the existing capacity base.  


 
HNI management credits the expansion of the company’s GPM in recent 


years to such productivity improvements (and points to this expansion to support 
its claim that 25% incremental operating margins going forward are achievable). 
Of course, it is difficult to identify how much this CapEx might have contributed to 
the expansion in HNI’s gross margins. However, as we noted above, the 
simultaneous GPM expansion at other publicly traded furniture companies 
suggests that the main driver of GPM has more likely been a macro factor that 
impacted the whole industry (i.e. raw materials).  


 
More questionable, perhaps, is that since 2012, HNI has been capitalizing 


expenses related to an ERP implementation and various (and vaguely defined) 
“business systems transformation” initiatives (ironically dubbed “BST” by the 
company-you can’t make these things up).  


 
There are several notable points to highlight on this issue. First, the amounts 


capitalized ($165MM over 5 years and counting, or $2.52/share after tax) appear
24 


unusually high. By comparison, refer to our PDCO initiation from August 2016. 
We wondered then if PDCO might have been aggressive in capitalizing expenses 
related to its own ERP rollout, and those totaled only $89MM (compared to 
PDCO’s initial budget of $35MM in capitalized expenses), roughly half the 
amount HNI has capitalized so far.   


 
It also appears, based on public comments by HNI management, that the 


“BST” expenses being capitalized extend beyond the simple implementation of an 
Oracle ERP, and may include a variety of other internal expenses the company 
deems to be related to “productivity improvement.” For example, here is HNI’s 
CEO on the 1Q16 earnings call, roughly 4 years after “BST” was launched: 


 
“Business Systems Transformation is a broad-based transformation on how we work. It's a 
national extension of our rapid, continuous improvement culture with substantial process 
simplifications already occurred that eliminates waste from our combined total business . . . BST 
is not just an Oracle implementation. It's really understand, simplify, standardize then flow. And 
so we have 100 people to 150 people working full-time on that, and we're seeing the benefits in 
the business even before we roll to the – do an Oracle implementation.” [Source: 1Q16 earnings 
call; OWS emphasis]  


 
 HNI investors should demand that HNI management be more clear with 
investors how it is accounting for the “100 to 150” full time employees and other 
various costs of “BST” that may not be directly related to the Oracle 
implementation.  
 
 It appears that HNI has repeatedly suggested over the years that this CapEx 
would scale back, or at least level out, but that has not happened. For example, 
here is HNI management responding to a question on its 4Q 2012 earnings call 
(note that 2012 CapEx totaled $60MM, less than half its present run rate): 
 


[Street analyst]: [Y]ou gave some CapEx guidance [for 2013] and it looked like that's a little, 
maybe a step-up from what we saw this year. Yet it seems like – given what you've said about Q1 
. . . it seems like you're implying . . . some reduced spending. . .  
 
Answer – Kurt A. Tjaden: . . . I would posit that most of [our projected] earnings enhancement 
is driven by investments already made . . . 


[Street analyst]:. . . But is there going to be incremental spending next year or are you going to 
kind of level off at these levels? � 


Answer – Kurt A. Tjaden: I think you hit it. It's kind of a level. Nothing significant. We're 
looking to redeploy existing investment dollars, where we have opportunities. . . But [on] net, not 
significant from an incremental investment perspective year-on-year. [Source: 4Q12 earnings 
call] 


Notably, HNI still hasn’t begun amortizing most of the capitalized software 
that has accumulated on its balance sheet from “BST.” As of Sep-30-3016, the
25 


company had $144MM in capitalized software on its balance sheet, or $2.19 per 
share. However, amortization expense on the P&L has been running at only 
~$4MM p.a., or $0.06/share. This low amount does not seem to square with 
management’s claim that it is already benefiting from “simplifications already 
occurred,” since it should be amortizing any investment from which it is realizing a 
benefit. See Table 2, below. We note that HNI’s deferred tax liability has 
ballooned (to $102MM as of the most recent balance sheet date) because it has 
been amortizing these capitalized expenses for income tax purposes, but not on the 
P&L it presents to investors.

Further, it appears that HNI has repeatedly delayed the start of amortization. 
For example, it seems HNI had told “street” analysts on its 1Q 2013 earnings call 
(the last time it appears that “street” analysts bothered to ask about this issue) that 
it expected the D&A impact of these “BST” investments to start running through 
the P&L in 2014-15:  


 
[Street analyst]: All right. And then with the increase in CapEx and these investments, I guess, 
that you're making, at what point do we see the D&A piece kick up on the income statement? . . .  


Answer – Kurt A. Tjaden: Yeah, I think it's really 2014 and 2015, more towards 2015 when you 
start to see it . . .  


[Street analyst]: Okay. And . . . can you give us a feel for how significant the ramp in D&A 
might be at that point?  


Answer – Kurt A. Tjaden: No. I think we'll decline on that one. [Source: 1Q13 earnings call] 


We understand that HNI has recently told investors that it should begin 
amortizing these capitalized expenses on its balance sheet sometime in 2017, but 
that it will do so over an unusually long 10-year depreciable life. Table 3, below, 
shows the depreciable life assumption for capitalized software that is disclosed by 
a random selection of companies across various industries. Relative to peers, it 
appears that HNI’s 10 years would be an extreme outlier.
26

FICO Fair Isaac 3 years 
FFIV F5 Networks 3-5 years 
AAPL Apple 3-5 years 
CPRT Copart 3 years

Putting the difference into perspective, were HNI to amortize its cap 
software over a 3-year period, in line with other companies, that would represent 
roughly a $0.73/share annual hit to reported earnings (over a 10-year life, it would 
be roughly ~$0.22/share p.a.).  


 
Interestingly, we note that in 2015, HNI sacked its auditor 


(http://bit.ly/2kCPFfM). Incidentally, this took place around the time that HNI 
management had previously claimed (see above) it would have to start amortizing 
the capitalized expenses on its balance sheet.  


 
At the same time that it sacked its auditor (i.e. prior to the 2016 annual 


meeting), HNI also shuffled its audit committee. As of the date of the 2016 proxy, 
the audit committee consisted of three members: Cheryl Francis, Dennis Martin, 
and Larry Porcellato. Francis was previously on the audit committee, but was 
promoted to Chairwoman. Martin and Porcellato were new to the audit committee.   


 
Of the three, it appears that Cheryl Francis is the only audit committee 


member with any specific background in accounting or finance. She was formerly 
CFO of RR Donnelly, but resigned for “personal reasons” in March 2000 
(http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/chief-financial-officer-cheryl-francis-
resigns-at-rr-donnelley-73081002.html), and it does not appear that she has held 
any corporate management role since that time. She is one of the longest serving 
members of HNI’s board, having held a board seat since 1999.  


 
Martin was CEO of Federal Signal and has a management consulting 


background (his bio notes “he is considered a lean business expert.”) Porcellato ran
27 


a series of building products companies as CEO. Interestingly, it appears that 
Martin, who is only 64, may have resigned from HNI’s board since being 
appointed to the audit committee in Spring 2016: he is no longer listed as a board 
member on the company’s website (http://www.hnicorp.com/investors/corporate-
governance).  


 
Perhaps oddly, it does not appear that HNI disclosed Martin’s resignation to 


investors in an 8-K filing. However, in August 2016, HNI appointed a new board 
member, John Hartnett (press release here: 
http://investors.hnicorp.com/file/Index?KeyFile=35434183), who appears to have 
replaced Martin as the third member of the audit committee. Hartnett, also, has no 
apparent accounting or finance background: his bio states that he has held “a series 
of engineering, marketing, and management roles” at Illinois Tool Works.   


 
Lastly, we also note that HNI moved its long-serving CFO to a different role 


within the company in January 2017. Kurt Tjaden, who has held the CFO role 
since 2008, was moved to the role of President, HNI International. For a company 
with less than 5% of its total sales generated overseas, this doesn’t necessarily 
seem, at least from our outsider’s perspective, to be a promotion.  


 
    Overall, HNI’s approach to cost capitalization seems aggressive, to say the 
least, and, at the same time, there appears to be an unusual amount of volatility 
around the board and executive suite. Given these factors, it is notable that the 
company has increased its total FY16 CapEx guidance substantially throughout the 
course of 2016 (from $105MM-$110MM a year ago, to $130MM-$135MM 
today), which it had not done in prior years. Of course, this accounting has the 
potential to increase reported earnings. Caveat emptor. This may be “BST.”  
 
6. Recent results 
 
 HNI is due to report 4Q16 results after the market closes on Wednesday, 
February 8, and will hold a conference call on Thursday morning.  
 
 HNI’s 3Q16 results, which the company pre-announced in September, fell 
well short of management’s guidance and “street” expectations. Total 3Q16 sales 
of $585MM fell -5% Y/Y (versus guidance of 0%-3% growth) and were down  
-6.6% Y/Y on an organic basis. Non-GAAP EPS of $0.80 (-14% Y/Y) missed 
guidance of $0.93. The company blamed this on “overall softer than anticipated 
demand.”  
 
 In the Office Furniture segment, revenues of $455MM were down -4.4% 
Y/Y (-6.4% Y/Y organic). Management had previously guided to revenue growth 
of 0%-4% Y/Y. The company noted that revenues were down -2% Y/Y in the
28 


“supplies driven” business (well below management’s guidance of positive 6%-9% 
Y/Y) and -10% Y/Y in the “contract” business (versus guidance of flat to -3% 
Y/Y). Office Furniture segment operating margins of 9.8% were down -40bps 
Y/Y.  
 
 In the Hearth segment, revenues decreased -7.3% Y/Y. Management’s 
previous guidance was -1% Y/Y to +3% Y/Y. Sales tied to new construction were 
down -3% Y/Y, sales tied to retrofit increased +3% Y/Y, while sales of pellet 
appliances (which make up ~10% of the Hearth segment) fell by -38% Y/Y. Hearth 
segment operating margins of 14.7% were down -210bps Y/Y. 
 
 Corporate expense of $12.2MM compared to $10.8MM in the prior year 
quarter, and accounted for -30bps of operating margin de-leverage.  
 
 Consolidated (GAAP) gross margin of 37.9% was up +30bps Y/Y. 
Management attributed this on the conference call to “favorable price cost 
benefits” (i.e. raw material pricing) outweighing the negative impact of declining 
sales. GAAP SG&A of $168.3MM compared to $170.4MM in the prior year 
quarter. As a % of sales, SG&A increased to 28.8%, up +110bps Y/Y. 
 
 Sustainable FCF (NI + D&A – CapEx) totaled $25.2MM in the quarter, or 
$0.55 / share. This compared to reported, non-GAAP EPS of $0.80.  
 
 Management guided to a 4Q16 Office Furniture revenue decline of -1%-4% 
Y/Y (-3%-6% Y/Y organic). Sales in the “supplies driven” channel were projected 
to be down -2%-5% Y/Y in 4Q (-5%-8% Y/Y organic), while sales in the 
“contract” channel were projected to be flat to up +3% Y/Y. Hearth segment sales 
were projected to be up +1% Y/Y to down -2% Y/Y.  
 
 Management guided to non-GAAP 4Q16 gross margins of 40.0% (which 
compares to 37.7% in the prior year quarter). Non-GAAP SG&A was projected to 
represent 29% of sales for the quarter (versus 28% in the prior year quarter). 
Management guided to non-GAAP EPS of $0.81-$0.91 (down 0%-11% Y/Y).  
 
 Management also provided initial 2017 guidance on the 3Q16 earnings call. 
Total sales growth is expected to be -2% Y/Y to +2% Y/Y. Non-GAAP EPS is 
expected to be between $2.75-$3.15 (+3%-18% Y/Y). We note that HNI 
management expects to realize $35MM-$40MM in cost savings ($0.53-$0.61/share 
after tax) from its latest round of consolidating its manufacturing footprint, which 
it expects to start in 2017.  
 
7. Financial assumptions
29 


 We project total revenues for HNI of $2.16B in 2017 (-2% Y/Y) and $2.17B 
in 2018 (-2% Y/Y). This compares to consensus of $2.24B (+2% Y/Y) and $2.32B 
(+4% Y/Y) in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
 
 For the Office Furniture segment, we project revenues of $1.64B (-3.0% 
Y/Y) in 2017 and $1.59B (-4% Y/Y) in 2018. Underlying this projection, we 
assume that white-collar employee growth of 1%-2% is offset by the continued 
decline in per-employee furniture spend and a low single-digit Y/Y decline in 
gross leasing volumes.  
 
 For the Hearth segment, which is not the focus of our investment thesis, we 
project revenues of $520MM in 2017 (+3% Y/Y) and $536MM in 2018 (+3% 
Y/Y). These growth rates assume a low-to-mid single-digit growth rate in single-
family housing starts, and a low single-digit growth rate in retrofits/remodels.  
 
 We project GAAP GPM of 37.9% in 2017 (-50bps Y/Y) and 38.1% in 2018 
(+20bps Y/Y). Our projection assumes that the rebound in raw material prices 
(especially steel) negatively impacts HNI’s gross margin in 2017 at a similar 
magnitude to prior periods (as discussed above). This is partially offset in our 
model by the $35MM-$40MM (~180bps) GPM benefit that management expects 
from the closing of manufacturing facilities, which should partially benefit 2017 
and be fully incorporated into 2018 numbers. If we are under-estimating the raw 
material impact, or if management is over-estimating the margin benefit from its 
latest restructuring activities, our GPM projections could prove conservative.        
 
 We project SG&A represents 30.1% of sales in 2017 (+10bps Y/Y) and 
30.1% of sales in 2018. Given HNI’s historical track record of SG&A deleverage, 
this might be a generous assumption, especially if the top line declines as we 
project.  
 
 In addition, we project that amortization expense will increase to $11.2MM 
($0.17/share) in 2017 (up from $4.5MM in 2016) and $18.7MM ($0.29/share) in 
2018. This assumes that HNI begins amortizing its capitalized software around 
mid-year 2017, over a 10-year period. Of course, as we discuss above, the timing 
of this amortization appears to be highly uncertain. It is also not clear whether 
“street” analysts are including this amortization expense in their own models. 
 
 In sum, we project non-GAAP EPS of $2.43 in 2017 and $2.17 in 2018. This 
compares to “street” consensus of $2.98 and $3.39 in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 
While our EPS projection for 2018 is well below consensus, note that we project 
the gap between FCF and reported earnings should narrow as non-cash 
amortization hits the P&L and CapEx drops over the next two years (which, based
30 


on HNI’s track record, may not happen). Therefore, our 2018 EPS projection 
should be closer to actual cash earnings than is presently the case.   
 
8. Valuation 
 
 Our $35 price target implies a market cap of $1.6B, 0.75x our projected 
2018 revenues of $2.1B. According to Bloomberg, over the past 10 years, HNI has 
traded at a median P/S multiple of 0.75x, so our price target implies that HNI 
simply returns to a “mid cycle” price to sales multiple. We note that, in past 
periods when investors have appeared to assume that the cycle was turning down 
(as in mid-2012 and early 2016), HNI has historically traded closer to a 0.60x P/S 
multiple. 
  


Looking at the bottom line, our $35 price target also represents a 16.2x 
multiple of our 2018 earnings projection of $2.17.  HNI currently sells at a 14.8x 
multiple of consensus 2018 EPS of $3.41, so there might be additional downside to 
our price target.  


 
If our thesis plays out, a 16.2x multiple would be too generous for a cyclical 


business lapping peak demand and peak margins. We note that, following HNI’s 
Sep-2016 pre-announcement of weak earnings, shares traded down to $37. We 
expect HNI shares to fall below that level.  
 
9. Risks to our target price 
 
 The key risk to our thesis is if we have misidentified where we are in the 
office cycle. Since the US is nearing full employment (which should limit future 
payrolls growth and associated net absorption), the bigger risk would be around 
gross leasing volumes, which we discuss, above. 
 
 The other risk is that investors may ignore quality of earnings and cash flow 
issues, and that the SEC might also continue to ignore these issues. HNI might 
continue aggressively capitalizing expenses, keeping them off the P&L.
