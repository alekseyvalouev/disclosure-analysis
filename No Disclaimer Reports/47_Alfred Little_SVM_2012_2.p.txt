Silvercorp President Myles Gao's Recent Statement Contradicts The
Historical Size Of The Ying Mine

On 4/18/12 Silvercorp Metals (NYSE: SVM) President & COO Myles Gao made a
presentation at the 2012 European Gold Forum in Zurich, Switzerland. I uploaded a
recording of the webcast of Mr. Gao's presentation to my Vimeo site (here). The webcast
was also archived by the European Gold Forum (here).


About four and a half minutes into the presentation, Mr. Gao reads from slide #6 that
"Silvercorp's strategy is to focus on generating cash flows early on by developing high
grade projects that may be too small for large companies and too large for junior
companies."


Mr. Gao then paused from reading the slides and gave an example of SVM's strategy he
recalled from his experience as SVM's Qualified Person on the Ying acquisition project in
2004:


For example, like you know, at the very beginning the Ying mine very small, only
have about, uh, less than 20 millions, uh, 2 million ounces of silver, and so
probably is too, you know, too [inaudible], too, too, too small for like, uh, the big
companies, but, uh, for large [inaudible] for the uh small companies maybe you
know, uh, it's probably too, too, you know, too hard to develop, so Silvercorp had that
property and they fast developed it to a mine. [emphasis added]


Mr. Gao's recollection of the small size of the Ying silver resource is troubling. What did he
mean when he said "less than 20 millions, uh, 2 million ounces of silver?" Personally, after
listening to the recording many times I think he meant 2 million ounces of silver.
Regardless, as I will show below either figure should be problematic for SVM investors.


On 4/26/04 SVM (then called "SKN Resources") issued a press release (archived here)
announcing it had signed a final cooperative joint venture contract acquiring a 70%
interest in the Ying project. In the press release, SVM disclosed for the first time the
following table of Ying (or "SGX") silver resource estimates:

Combining the indicated and inferred silver resources of 8,359,713 and 52,663,286 from
the table results in 61,022,999 total ounces of silver.


So regardless of whether you believe Myles Gao meant 20 million or 2 million
ounces of silver, both are a far cry from the 61 million ounces of silver first
disclosed by SVM at the very beginning on 4/26/04.


There are, of course, a number of possible explanations for Myles Gao's questionable
statement:


1. Myles simply misspoke. He meant to say 61 million ounces of silver.
2. Myles really meant 20 million ounces and the 61 million ounces originally reported was


a 3x exaggeration.
3. Myles really meant 2 million ounces and the 61 million ounces originally reported was


a 30x exaggeration.
4. Myles might explain that resource estimates are all really "apples and oranges" such


that 61 million, 20 million, and 2 million are all somehow correct.


More than likely, SVM will simply advise investors to continue to ignore the "short and
distort" conspiracy. Maybe SVM will announce the belated repurchase of a few more
shares using the mountain of cash reported on its balance sheet. Or better yet, overpay
for a few more acquisitions in China before the Ying mine is depleted.


Whatever SVM responds, it will not stop us from fulfilling our new mission
(announced 12/19/11 here) to expose fraud, corruption and other crimes committed by a
small group of U.S. listed Chinese companies whose management utilize threats, false
arrests, violent force, kidnappings, corruption of foreign officials and abuse of the legal
system to silence their critics and deprive them of their right of free speech and expression
of their investment opinions.


Since 12/19/11, we have experienced great success in fulfilling our new mission and have
received well deserved recognition for our past work exposing Chinese stock fraud:


1. On 12/20/11, a Freedom of Information Act ("FOIA") request for records on Deer
Consumer Products (NASDAQ: DEER) and its management and directors was denied by
the SEC because specific or contemplated law enforcement proceedings against DEER
