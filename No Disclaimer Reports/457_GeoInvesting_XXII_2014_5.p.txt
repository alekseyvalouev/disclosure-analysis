22nd Century Group, Inc.
(XXII) – Claims Meeting to
Advance BRAND B Tobacco
Product
September 25, 2014 By GeoTeam


22nd Century Group, Inc. (XXII) put out a press release
this morning announcing that they have scheduled a
meeting with the FDA to “discuss further development of
the company’s potential modified risk tobacco product,
code named BRAND B.


It’s Really Only “Potential” Future
Endeavors


Despite the fact that the headline to this PR says the
meeting is to “advance development,” the text of the press
release confirms that this appears to be nothing more than
a scheduled discussion about “potential” future
endeavors. As you may recall, we noted in our article
out on August 27  that the company’s X-22 product failed
clinical trials and was suspended by the company in 2013.
CEO Pandolfino has been trying to push the alternative
tobacco story since 1994 and has yet to break through to
the mainstream. Much like the last cannabis related PR, we
believe this news to be more of the same: a carrot hung on
a string in front of shareholders, while the company bides
time and continues to dilute. We’re not considering
reevaluating our XXII thesis until we see some real
financial traction from the company. We will look to add to
our short position if shares pump on this news.
