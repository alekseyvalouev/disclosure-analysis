Athenex – Too little, too late  
Poorly designed clinical study  for flagship drug outdated since 2005. 


Meanwhile, Directors s iphon large amounts  of cash from shareholders.  


October 22, 2019 - Viceroy Research is short Athenex, Inc. (NASDAQ: ATNX). Our 


research has found significant causes for concern in the company’s operations, 


management and clinical trial design. Our research, paired with discussions with 


industry specialists, leads us to believe Oraxol is obsolete in modern world 


medicine. We conclude that Athenex exists to abuse capital markets and enrich its 


management through related party transactions and licensing deals, rather than 


bring revolutionary drugs into the market.   


Viceroy value ATNX stock at US$2.83 – a 71% downside –the sum of its tangible 


book value and 1x valuation on its licensing & consulting revenue streams, for the 


year ending June 30, 2019. With ATNX’s questionable license acquisitions and 


management’s precedent for overstated top line figures in previous ventures: this 
is optimistic. 


Management – A Company of Rogues 


▪ Several members of Athenex’s management team have a history of what appears to be either gross 


incompetence in fiduciary duties or clever mismanagement in infamous frauds internationally, 


collectively resulting in billions of dollars of write-offs including Sino Forest and Suntech.  


▪ ATNX directors have also acted as sellers and drop-shippers to rip off Athenex shareholders with margin-


stealing exercises through their investment entity: Avalon Global. Cash has consistently exited the 


business via similar related party deals.  


▪ Breaches in corporate governance principles: Athenex directors screwed investors by purchasing CDE for 


themselves and flipping it to Athenex for a 262% profit in 6 weeks. The company failed to report the 


circumstances of the transaction in any meaningful way. 


▪ In a separate instance, Directors pocketed a 3,300% profit by flipping an “anti-cancer mechanism” license 


to Athenex for US$5m, for which they paid just US$150,000 just 6 months earlier.  


▪ Directors award themselves millions of dollars’ worth of stock at no cost through the issuance of 


promissory notes that are cancelled on a time-vested basis.  


▪ Athenex directors have an uncanny ability to avoid any disclosure or reference to their involvement in 


historical fraud or related party deals. It's Viceroy's view that if investors were aware, they would not 


have bought $ATNX in the first place.    


▪ Athenex’s CFO J. Nick Riehle left unexpectedly for a “planned” retirement, just 10 months after joining the 


company but is now seeking work as a consultant. 


Oraxol – Flagship or Shipwreck? 


Athenex has been reliant on the marketed prospect of Oraxol in order to obtain access to capital, having 


received going concern qualifications from Deloitte since 2016 and current yearly cash-burn rates of ~$100m. 


The company has raised ~US$360m in equity and US$80m in debt since 2017. Even if R&D costs are removed 


from the equation, Athenex’s licensing and consulting segments are operationally loss-making.  


▪ After consultation with industry specialists and oncologists, Viceroy believes Athenex’s flagship paclitaxel 


drug, Oraxol, cannot compete with the current standard of care available in the USA.   


▪ Oraxol’s clinical trial’s control dosing regimen of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy is an outdated treatment 


schedule dating from the 1990’s.

▪ Oraxol’s marketed quality of life improvements are redundant. Patients will still require IV /treatment 


post-treatment, alongside complications from oral treatment.  


▪ Oraxol’s side effects appear more severe than those of the current US standard of care, Abraxane, and may 


require hospitalization due to their life-threatening nature. Reported adverse effects grade 4 neutropenia, 


grade 3 vomiting and unspecified GI complications were more severe than IV paclitaxel intake.  


▪ None of Oraxol’s clinical trials have included a US patient component. While the FDA does allow data 


overseas trials, these results are treated with much higher scrutiny. Viceroy believe ATNX studies are being 


conducted in South America due to a lower local standard of care: US patients could not be enticed to trial 


a drug against an outdated active control regimen.   


▪ Athenex’s Orascovery program – key to its marketed value proposition – was purchased for just US$7.5m 


upfront in 2011 after its previous owner experienced decade-long development delays with little headway 


into development. The Orascovery platform is busted.  


▪ Through consultation with experts, we believe Athenex’s pursuit of the 505b(2) pathway for Oraxol will be 


hampered by the fact that its paclitaxel delivery mechanism, HM30181A, has never been approved by the 


FDA. The FDA may require Athenex to pursue a further NDA for HM30181A. 


▪ Viceroy have identified what we believe to be Intellectual Property Theft from UK company Immunocore.  


XLifeSc’s flagship technology (in which ATNX put $35m upfront) may already be owned by GSK and further 


along the development pipeline: GSK’s solution is currently undergoing phase 2 trials in the US. 





Athenex’s operational and R&D cash-burn rate is over US$100m a year – the company would be lucky to survive 


until HY 2020 without needing a further cash injection from investors. Even if Athenex scrapped its R&D 


completely, the company’s revenue streams operate at a substantial loss. 


Accordingly, we believe our valuation of $2.83 is optimistic, and will be realized in the short term. We do not 


see a future for the company in its current state.

1. Background 


Athenex is a biopharma company principally concerned with the development and marketing of the Orascovery 


platform in the field of anti-cancer treatment. The Orascovery program is HM30181A, an inhibitor of P-


glycoprotein (PGP), a protein found in the gastrointestinal tract. The suppression of PGP allows the oral 


administration of drugs not previously possible.  


The company’s flagship drug Oraxol is a formulation that combines the widely used paclitaxel chemical with 


HM30181A to create a novel oral chemotherapy formulation. The company generates some revenue through 


the sale of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients (APIs) and has other drugs in the pipeline but Athenex’s value 


proposition is largely dependent on the success of Oraxol. Gross profits generated through the APIs business are 


not even sufficient to cover a third of the current company’s SG&A (not including R&D expenses). 


2. Clinical trials 


Our research into Athenex’s Oraxol clinical trials1 and review of existing literature leads us to believe that the 


company has significantly overstated its potential market. Viceroy discovered this isn’t the first time that 


directors of Athenex been alleged to overstate the success of a drug! Since the inception of the Orascovery 


platform the treatment landscape for cancer and particularly Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) has changed 


significantly. 


Other circumstances around the clinical trials suggest the company may also face significant scrutiny of its results 


by the FDA. We do not think it is out of the question that the FDA places increased scrutiny, delays or rejects 


Oraxol’s approval as a result of these factors. 


A summary of our concerns: 


1. The Active Control Treatment of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy is no longer standard of care in the US.  


2. One of Oraxol’s main draws: that it does not require premedication, has already been effectively solved by 


the industry incumbent Abraxane.  


3. Oraxol’s side effects may cancel out its supposed benefits in any real-world application. Observed side 


effects may be worse in terms of patient quality of life than the incumbent treatment. 


4. None of Athenex’s Oraxol clinical trials have been performed on a US population, generally recommended 


to obtain FDA approval. Viceroy believes this will seriously hamper its efforts to obtain FDA approval, and a 


result of the IV paclitaxel baseline treatment being redundant as US standard of care. 


5. The FDA has not approved HM30181A, and may not allow Oraxol to continue with the 505b(2) regulatory 


pathway if it deems HM30181A a new drug. 


6. Several of the CROs used by Athenex are related parties which may influence the FDA’s view on the validity 


of results from clinical trials conducted by them. ZenRx is part owned by CMO Rudolf Kwan and Athenex 


recently purchased assets and liabilities of CIDAL. 


We will go through each of our concerns in turn in the following section. 


Irregularities with the IV paclitaxel dosing regimen used in the phase 3 study. 


Athenex has been conducting its Oraxol trials by comparing it to a course of IV paclitaxel as monotherapy. While 


IV paclitaxel is a valid monotherapy treatment for Stage IV MBC, this schedule is not widely used in the US and 


has not been since the 90’s. Most drug regimens prescribed today are either sequential (different treatments 


administered one after the other) or combination (several treatments with non-overlapping side effects at once) 


therapies2.

Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


Oncology professionals consulted by Viceroy told us Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) is more likely to be used instead 


of IV paclitaxel as it does not need premedication to prevent solvent-related hypersensitivity reactions. By not 


using Abraxane as the active control treatment Athenex has been able to promote Oraxol’s upside as a drug not 


requiring premedication.  


Abraxane, approved in 2005, already effectively solved this problem in the field. Instead of using a solvent 


such as CrEL or polysorbate, Abraxane uses albumin3 and paclitaxel to more effectively deliver paclitaxel to the 


cells. 


 
Figure 1 Taxanes for the Treatment of Metastatic Breast Cancer4 


This is likely the reason the trials were run in outside the US: patients without alternatives are more likely to 


go for the sub-optimal monotherapy treatment. While not out the question for a doctor to prescribe IV 


paclitaxel as monotherapy in the US, we were told such cases are relatively rare and depend on the patient and 


their needs. 


This leads to another issue where Oraxol is likely to be prescribed as part of combination or sequential therapy 


leading to the same side effects in any case and at greater cost to the customer.  


As already noted by some in the market, the ORR reported by the IV paclitaxel arm of the phase III study is at 


the lower range for paclitaxel administered in this dose. The 175mg/m2 q3-weekly IV paclitaxel regimen 


generally reports a 20-40% ORR placing the Athenex phase 3 study control’s ORR of 24% at the lower end of the 


spectrum 


 
Figure 2 Paclitaxel in Breast Cancer 5 


Side effects 


Stage IV Metastatic Breast Cancer (MBC) is incurable, so treatments are palliative and focused on Quality of Life 


(QoL), Progression Free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) with order of importance largely determined by 


the patient. In its clinical trials Athenex noted several incidences of grade 4 neutropenia6 and grade 3 vomiting 


and one incidence of febrile neutropenia7.

Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyresearch.org 


This is to be expected because the time over which a specific paclitaxel dose is administered is relevant to the 


incidence of several side effects: 


• Shorter, higher Cmax regimens generally result in neuropathy: tingling and numbness of extremities which 


may or may not fade over time. 


• Longer, lower Cmax regimens generally result in neutropenia: a low neutrophil count (a type of white blood 


cell). 


 
Figure 3 Paclitaxel in Breast Cancer 


Experts consulted by Viceroy informed us that, of the two, neutropenia was the less desirable as it left the 


patient’s body essentially unable to fend for itself. 


Further, grade 3 vomiting, grade 4 neutropenia and febrile neutropenia require hospitalisation for the patient 


somewhat mooting Oraxol’s supposed quality of life improvements. For reference, grade 3 vomiting is defined 


as “≥6 episodes separated by 5 minutes in 24 hours; tube feeding, TPN or hospitalization indicated” 8 


Oraxol also recorded a higher incidence rate of gastrointestinal (GI) complications: this is characteristic of other 


PGP inhibitors and there are issues inherent with an oral medication causing vomiting as it may cause the patient 


to expel any unabsorbed medication.  


 
Figure 4 Athenex Press Release dated August 7, 20199 


If HM30181A is the suspected cause of the GI complication the FDA may require more trials to be conducted.  


Lack of US clinical trials 


So far none of Oraxol’s clinical trials have been held in the US nor had any US participants. While the FDA does 


technically accept data from clinical trials conducted entirely overseas such data is more likely to be subject to 


increased scrutiny by the FDA.  


Recent developments in FDA guidance and sentiment have also resulted in a higher inspection rate for overseas 


trial locations10. 


The FDA also unofficially recommends that at least some percentage of patients in submitted clinical trials are 


in the US. This differs based on the intended indication for the drug. For example for cardiovascular and diabetes 


drugs the FDA expects roughly a quarter of patients to be enrolled in the US11. An article originally published by 


STAT noted that where data was available only 3 drugs approved in 2017 had fewer than a quarter of patients 


in the US.

Figure 5 Most Experimental Drugs are Tested Offshore–Raising Concerns about Data  


For example, Abraxane had a US/Canada population for its clinical trials with 8% of patients and 31% of sites in 


the US & Canada12. Other oncology studies that did not provide as much transparency into patient numbers 


nonetheless reported a sizeable North America/Western Europe component with several US sites. 


 
Figure 6 Abraxane clinical trial data – Journal of Clinical Oncology 


We do not believe this alone is grounds for the FDA to reject Oraxol’s data but do believe that the risk factors 


we outline in this report will influence the FDA’s treatment of that data.   


FDA clearance issues 


Athenex is pursuing the 505b(2) pathway for Oraxol: a hybrid between an NDA and an ANDA13. Unlike an NDA, 


the 505b(2) pathway is not testing an entirely new drug, nor is it applying for a generic. In Oraxol’s case Athenex 


seeks to use the existing approval of paclitaxel for the indication with a novel delivery method. 


 
Figure 7 Good Review Practice: Clinical Review of Investigational New Drug Applications14 


However, the PGP inhibitor delivery method HM30181A has never received FDA approval. If this is the cause of 


the increased incidence of GI complications the FDA may restrict Athenex’s use of the 505b(2) pathway and 


question the use of IV paclitaxel as the active control treatment. While Athenex’s management has moved to 


reassure investors that this is unlikely we are not so sure. 


As noted above the increased incidence rate of gastrointestinal complications has been observed in other PGP 


inhibitors15.

Zenith Technology & ZenRx 


On May 6, 2013 Kinex Pharmaceuticals announced a licensing agreement with Zenith Technology Corporation 


through its affiliate ZenRx for Oraxol and Oratecan in New Zealand. In exchange, Zenith Technology would 


“commit a significant amount of resources to the Oraxol and Oratecan global development platforms”. 


By a staggering coincidence ZenRx was only incorporated in July 2013, roughly a month and a half after Kinex’s 


agreement was signed. 


 
Figure 8 ZenRx company summary16 


The important part of the above is ZenRx, which is partly held by Athenex’s now-Chief Medical Officer Rudolf 


Min-Fun Kwan17, who joined the company in 2014 but had acted as an advisor since 2008. ZenRx is also in line 


for several milestone payments, the amounts of which are undisclosed by Athenex. 


 
Figure 9 Athenex 2018 10-K 


We view Zenith Technology and ZenRx as tied as: 


1. Both ZenRx and Zenith Technologies list Cheung-Tak Hung as a shareholder 


2. Both companies have the same address: 156 Frederick Street, North Dunedin, Dunedin, 9016, New Zealand 


3. Athenex has not published any agreement with Zenith Technology, but does have one with ZenRx, who 


appears to collect all consideration from the agreement.

We view the main issue at ZenRx to be the conflict of interest with Kwan and Hung which are made worse by 


potential previous issues at DemeRx at the same facility. The conflict increases the likelihood of interference in 


the trials. 


CIDAL 


On June 27, 2019, Athenex entered into an agreement to acquire certain assets and liabilities of CIDAL 


Limited21, a contract research organization which had provided services for Athenex including its Phase 3 study 


for Oraxol in metastatic breast cancer. 


 
Figure 16 Athenex Q2 2019 10-Q 


Notably, we perceive the notion of “milestone payments” to your own drug’s CRO as a major red flag. 


11 days later Athenex released its Q2 2019 headline results including an extremely 


positive spin on its Oraxol phase 3 studies, all of which are being conducted by CIDAL in 


South America22.  


CIDAL is technically a BVI entity and as such we are unable to obtain any relevant financial information on the 


terms of the Athenex deal. Whether the purchase was contingent certain conditions is unknown, but we do find 


the timing and the nature of the purchase suspicious. 


We question why CIDAL were even acquired: CIDAL cites a significant number of clients that are internationally 


known23. By acquiring CIDAL, we question the future benefit or value of such an acquisition as the company's 


conflicts are greatly increased. 


Key Takeaways 


We believe Athenex has overstated the target market for Oraxol and their conduct in clinical trials indicates the 


company is aware of this fact. The control regimen, choice of population and choice of location suggest the 


company was unable to find a significant population of patients willing to accept the control treatment or their 


own. 


It is likely that Athenex and Hanmi Pharmaceutical before them were aware of these issued when going through 


the history of the Orascovery platform.

3. The Orascovery platform 


Athenex’s Orascovery platform is far older than generally known: the cornerstone of the platform being PGP 


inhibitor encequidar. In addition to this the circumstances of Athenex’s acquisition suggest the product is worth 


far less than suggested by the company. 


On September 20, 2000 Hanmi Pharmaceuticals and Dr. Yoo Sung-Eun’s Bio-organic Science Division of the 


Korean Research Institute of Chemical Technology announced success in oral paclitaxel (Oraxol) using an indole 


derivative (HM30181A) to block P-glycoprotein stomach lining24. This derivative is now referred to as 


encequidar. 


As part of the announcement, Hanmi announced that they aimed to market the drug by 2002 and completely 


replace the injectables market. 


 
Figure 17 Korea develops world’s first cancer pill – The Dong-a-ilbo 


A document dated December 2003 stated preclinical trials were scheduled to complete in 2003, with phase 1 to 


be completed by 2004 with licensing in place. 


In September 2005 Hanmi said the platform was in late preclinical status25 with the drug in phase 1 in August 


200626. A December 2007 document showed Oraxol to be in phase 1 trials with plans to move to phase 2 trials 


in H2 2008 by the Journal of Pharmaceutical Policy Research27. 


 
Figure 18 2007 Korea Pharmaceutical Industry Directory 


On December 11, 2011, Hanmi submitted the details of “A Study of Oraxol in Gastric Cancer Patients” to 


clinicaltrials.gov located at the National Cancer Center and Seoul National University Hospital. The study is still 


listed as recruiting. 8 days later, Hanmi and Kinex Pharmaceutical announced a license agreement for the 


platform, over a decade after the fanfare over its invention. 


▪ Why did Hanmi take so long to advance the development of Oraxol? 


▪ Did Hanmi invest the KRW2b into the Oraxol platform? 


▪ Why is so little literature on Oraxol available from the Hanmi era? 


The license was the first of several license agreements with Athenex (then Kinex Pharmaceuticals) for the use of 


the Orascovery program in several geographies.

2017. This is at odds with a complaint filed by Athenex against its Senior VP of Operations, Lyn Dyster for 


allegedly leaking details about its Orascovery program to Fulgent Therapeutics. The case was eventually settled: 


Athenex filed for US$2.9b in damages. 


▪ Why did Hanmi sell a platform it intended to invest KRW2b in for a total of US$7.4m to Athenex? 


▪ Why were the amendments to the December 2011 agreement to include Macau, Singapore, Malaysia, 


Thailand, Vietnam, the Phillipines and Indonesia done for no consideration?

4. Management: Rogues Gallery 


Chairman & CEO - “Johnson” Yiu-Nam Lau 


Roth Capital Partners 


Johnson was a Managing Director at Roth Capital partners from 2005-200728. Readers should note that short 


sellers in particular analyze anything coming out of Roth Capital Partners with extreme skepticism given the 


group’s extraordinary record of listing garbage international companies especially when a relationship with 


China is concerned. 


Former Independent Director – Song-Yi Zhang 


Zhang joined the Athenex board in June 2015, and his resignation was announced in March 29, 2019. Despite 


this Zhang remains a controlling stakeholder in Athenex associates together with existing management, who 


benefit heavily from related party dealings.  


Figure 19 Song-Yi Zhang insider transactions29 


The above extract from S&P Capital IQ suggests large disposals by Zhang and his holding companies, however 


we note that these transactions are extremely hard to follow due to Zhang’s withdrawal from the Athenex board 


and his maintained interest in the Avalon group (which owns substantial parcels of Athenex stock) alongside 


current management. Disclosures regarding the ownership split of Avalon Group show the Zhang’s stake has 


changed over time further obscuring how much of Athenex he actually owns. 


Mandra  


Readers may recall the Mandra name from Sino Forest, a massive Chinese timberland fraud that collapsed in 


2011. 


Mandra Forestry Finance was launched by Zhang to acquire 270,000 ha of Chinese timberland with US$195m in 


funding30. At the outset Sino Forest was a 15% shareholder, Morgan Stanley 10% and Zhang the remaining 75%. 


Zhang had left Morgan Stanley prior to the US$195m debt raise but was still engaged as an “advisory director” 


at the time of the bond sale.  


By March 2006 with the first payments due on its loan in a year, Mandra had only acquired 17,231 ha. Mandra 


missed its May 2009 payment after several downgrades to its debt31. The company had also failed to obtain 


permission to increase its timber production32. The company was on its last legs prior to this offering: only one 


of three Mandra subsidiaries has done any business prior to 2009, with one having ceased operations in 2006 


stating: “plan to purchase forest land could not be carried out” in Chinese filings and the other having conducted 


no business in its life.

Figure 20 “After China Boom, Debt Risks Appear” – Wall Street Journal June 1, 2009 


On July 6 2009, Mandra terminated two management agreements with Sino Forest, a move that the latter said 


it would dispute33.The now-infamous Sino Forest purchased substantially all the assets of Mandra Forestry 


Holdings Limited in February 2010 for US$9m in stock and assuming US$187m in debt34. At the time, Mandra 


had acquired 150,000ha of forest land citing its ability to produce “sustainable cash flow”.  


On the same day Sino Forest announced its intention to raise US$800m of new capital arguably using the 


announcement to prop up its weak cash flows at the time.  


Suntech Power Holdings 


Zhang was also involved in Suntech Power Holdings as director and chairman of the audit committee, a fact 


omitted in his Athenex biography. Suntech was forced into liquidation following its default on a US$541m bond 


payment in March 2013. The story of how the default came about is frankly fantastical35.  


Suntech aimed to expand into Italy in 2008 through a partnership with the Global Solar Fund SCA, which was 


established by Javier Ignacio Romero Ledesma. To bankroll this expansion, Suntech tapped the China 


Development Bank for an EUR554m loan with EUR560m in German government bonds pledged as security. The 


German government bonds were pledged by Romero’s personal investment vehicle, GSF Capital (separate from 


the Global Solar Fund SCA). 


Romero went through two individuals to purchase pre-developed land in Italy, which was later alleged to be a 


fraudulent scheme to siphon government funds. The Italian courts allege Romero made off with EUR6.5m in 


government funds. 27 of Suntech’s solar plants were seized by authorities. 


On July 30, 2012, with a bond payment coming due, Suntech announced that the German bonds it had been 


pledged from GSF Capital did not exist, nor had they ever existed. Court documents show that Suntech’s CEO 


had knowledge of this from February 2012, that Suntech had knowledge of Romero misrepresenting himself as 


a company executive and that through shifting of Italian operation ownership Suntech had booked huge gains 


through effectively selling to itself. 


We find believe this fact pattern, involvement with mismanagement and bailing out with suspiciously good 


timing, has continued at Athenex where Zhang appears to continue to “fail upward”.

President (China Division) – William Zuo 


Polymed and the Chongqing Factory 


Zuo the served as president of Polymed Therapeutics and Chairman of Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical, both 


of which were acquired by Athenex in June 2015.  


 
Figure 21 William Zuo biography - Athenex36 


We question Athenex’s judgement in this transaction: Chongqing Taihao received a form 483 from the FDA in 


March 2015 as a result of an inspection37. Form 483s are issued where violations of the Food Drug and Cosmetic 


Act and related Acts38 may have occured. This was not mentioned in Athenex’s prospectuses or other filings: the 


various underwriting agreements in their prospectus states the company had not received any such notes. 


 
Figure 22 Athenex Form S-1A dated June 2, 2017 


While this may not technically be a lie considering Athenex didn’t own the Chongqing facility at the time of 


receiving the Form 483 we have to ask why they would acquire such a liability in the first place.  


While this may not technically be a lie considering Athenex didn’t own the Chongqing facility at the time of 


receiving the Form 483 we have to ask why they would acquire such a liability in the first place. same 


address/officers as Polymed Therapeutics. Athenex acquired Polymed in June 2015, so why was this not 


disclosed?  


Inovachem 


Zuo was also the CEO of Inovachem, a shortlived US company whose only activity was the purchase of goods 


and licenses from Polymed. Inovachem generated no revenue and shared the same address and officers as 


Polymed pretty much making the entire venture an exercise in siphoning away the cash of Inovachem investors.

Figure  Inovachem Form 10-K 2008 


Inovachem raised a total of XX before the loss-making entity was sold and used to reverse list NuGen holdings 


on January 29, 2010. It was a short and downhill ride for those investors who saw the company generate a 


cumulative loss of US$1.26m generating for no revenue whatsoever. Most of those expenses were accounted 


for by compensation, professional fees and travel expenses.

The licenses and goods that Inovachem purchased from Polymed? Several patent applications for the creation 


of sucralose, a non-caloric sweetener which due to “the poor economy” was never produced. 


Inovachem does not appear on any of Zuo’s Athenex bios, nor did we really expect it to considering his joining 


of Athenex is much like a graduation to the major leagues of ripping off investors. From that perspective, Zuo is 


uniquely qualified for his role at Athenex.

Rudolf Kwan 


Viceroy Research loves coincidence and there is no greater coincidence than Dr Kwan’s involvement with a 


Parker Petit-related entity. Kwan served as president of privately held DemeRx on whose founding board sat 


Parker Petit and which was founded by several of Petit’s associates. Kwan appears to have gone by the name 


Rudy Kwan at this time most available information is from chapter 11 filings40. 


In 2013, Lawrence Friedhoff MD was recruited as CEO and President of DemeRx. In June that year VP of R&D 


and Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Deborah C. Mash resigned from the board over a clinical trial held in New Zealand 


instead of the United States. Another staggering coincidence is that ZenRx was only founded in July 2013.

5. Avalon Biomedical 


Three senior Athenex executives are involved with Avalon Global Holdings: a company engaged in margin 


stripping and cash siphoning deals with Athenex. Our research indicates Avalon Global Holdings enters into 


commercialization agreements with the Hong Kong Polytechnic University or other institutions, creates a 


subsidiary for each innovation and then licenses them out again. 


 
Figure 26 Avalon Biomedical – Companies41 


From their most recent disclosures, Avalon Global is 80% held by Lau, Fok, Zhang and their spouses through 


various investment vehicles. Zhang holds his through a Mandra Forestry affiliated entity. At the time of Athenex’s 


prospectus, 90% of Avalon Global was held by the three with the remaining 10% unaccounted for.

Figure 30 Avalon Biomedical (Management) Limited resolution dated February 17, 2015 


In effect Johnson, Zhang and Fok are on both sides of these transactions: licensing deals from third parties to 


Avalon and then selling some of them on to Athenex and taking a cut in the process.  


So far two of the Avalon entities have done business Athenex: Avalon Polytom, Avalon Biomedical and Avalon 


HepaPOC. 


Avalon Polytom 


Athenex licensed Pegtomarginase from Avalon Polytom as part of an agreement between them as of June 29, 


2019 for US$3m in cash and US$2m in stock.    


 
Figure 31 Athenex 2018 10-K44 


An announcement by the Hong Kong Polytechnic University dated December 10, 2018 states that Avalon 


PolyTom presented a cheque to the Department of Applied Biology and Chemical Technology in exchange for 


the Arginase License45. An attached photo shows the amount to be HKD1.17m (US$0.150m) 


 
Figure 32 Avalon Polytom presents cheque to Hong Kong Polytechnic University46 


Athenex shouldered the regulatory workload as well as potentially being on the hook for ~US$50m of payments 


to Avalon Polytom. Considering Athenex’s precarious financial position we see this as management taking 


investors for a ride pocketing a 3,300% profit by flipping a license to Athenex.

Avalon HepaPOC 


 
Figure 33 Agreement between Athenex and Avalon HepaPOC dated June 29, 201847 


Athenex’s collaboration with Avalon HepaPOC appears to be a simple drop-shipping operation. While Avalon 


HepaPOC has the same contact address and person as Avalon Polytom, the return address for any defective 


products is No. 7, Li-Shin 5th Rd., Hsinchu Science Park, Hsinchu, Taiwan.  


 
Figure XX Agreement between Athenex and Avalon HepaPOC dated June 29, 2018 


That address is Apex Biotechnology Taiwan, whose business is the production and sale of blood testing systems. 


 
Figure 34 ApexBio Taiwan contact details48 


 Avalon’s agreement with Athenex prices goods purchased from Avalon HepaPOC at 110% of cost invoiced from 


3rd party manufacturers. 


 
Figure 35 Agreement between Athenex and Avalon HepaPOC dated June 29, 2018 


The goods in question are a galactose meter and measuring strip, pictured in the agreement. 


 
Figure 36 Picture of Avalon HepaPOC Galactose Meter  


We question which part of this agreement was worth the payments made by Athenex to Avalon or why Athenex 


doesn’t simply buy these meters directly from Apexbio themselves, considering Avalon appears to be simply 


forwarding on product to Athenex with a 10% markup and pocketing the increased margin.

Viceroy Research Group 21 viceroyresearch.org 


According to Athenex’s prospectus the company acquired Comprehensive Drug Enterprises Ltd. (CDE) in June 


2015 for US$14.9m in shares . What was not said was that this transaction generated Athenex directors a 263% 


return on an investment made just prior. 


On June 1, 2015, just six weeks before Athenex’s announcement of the US$14.9 million acquisition of 100% of 


Athenex’s management and/or affiliated entities were allotted 8,304,986 shares of CDE at a price of HKD1.74 


(US$0.23) per share.  





 
Figure 37 Share issue documents 


The beneficiaries of this scheme are Manson Fok (director) , Johnson Yiu Nam Lau (CEO), Rudolf Min-Fun Kwan 


(CMO), Flint Besecker (CFO) and James H Zukin 


As a result, the total number of CDE shares increased to 18,089,547 on June 1, 2015.  


As disclosed in SEC filings on July 17, 2015 Athenex bought all 18,089,547 outstanding shares of CDE for 


US$14.9m or US$0.82 per share. Athenex’s management pocked an astonishing 262.83% return by flipping 


CDE shares they acquired on June 1, 2015 for US$0.23 per share to Athenex on July 17, 2015 for US$0.82 a 


share.
Viceroy Research Group 22 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 38 Athenex acquires all outstanding shares of Comprehensive Drug Enterprises 


We can pretty clearly gauge the actual value of the shares: CDE bought back its shares from existing shareholders 


at HKD1.28 (US$0.16) per share in July 2014. We doubt the company increased in value 513% 12 months later. 


 
Figure 39 Avalon Biomedical (Management) Limited resolution dated July 10, 2014 


The allocation of shares on June 1, 2015 Athenex increased Avalon Biomedical (Management) Limited stake to 


7,320,092 shares in CED (40.46% stake). Doing the math shows Avalon Biomedical (Management) held 29% of 


the CDE float prior to the allocation. 


 
Figure 40 CDE share ownership
Viceroy Research Group 23 viceroyresearch.org 


Athenex did disclose the related nature of the parties, but not how the deal had been financially engineered to 


benefit insiders at investors’ expense. Amazingly a “special committee of disinterested dicretors” found nothing 


wrong with the CDE acquisition agreement. 


 
Figure 41 Athenex Form S-1 


CDE also rents office space to Avalon Biomedical at Units 608- 613, No. 6 Science Park West Avenue, Hong Kong 


Science Park, Sha Tin, Hong Kong.  We question what exactly the point of this transaction was beyond enriching 


directors in addition to share option promissory note enrichment.  


We at Viceroy are almost impressed with the many and various ways Athenex’s insiders have managed to fleece 


investors.  


6. Xiangxue Pharmaceuticals and Axis Therapeutics 


On July 1, 2018 Athenex entered into a joint venture with Xiangxue Life Sciences (XLifeSc)49, a wholly owned 


subsidiary of Guangzhou Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd for the research, development and commercialization 


of anti-cancer T-cell receptor therapy. This joint venture would be called Axis Therapeutics Limited and owned 


55% by Athenex and 45% by XLifeSc.  


In exchange for this Athenex would issue US$5m of stock to XLifeSc and US$30m in cash to the joint venture. 


Axis would pay up to US$110m to XLifeSc. XLifeSc would also retain the mainland china rights with royalties on 


net income payable for Axis. 


In summary: 


▪ Athenex paid US$30m for 55% of Axis therapeutics 


▪ Athenex issued US$5m to XLS for the privilege of partnering with them. 


▪ Axis would pay up to US$110m to XLS subject to regulatory and clinical milestones. 


All XLS had to do was contribute a license for IPR&D of certain immunotherapy technology. This platform is 


cancer treatment through T-cell receptor therapy. Given consideration paid by Athenex, we decided to get a 


closer look at what they are getting out of the deal. 


What value Athenex is getting from XLS’s T-cell therapy platform? 


Our research suggests XLifeSc’s flagship technology may already be owned by GSK and further along the 


development pipeline: GSK’s solution is currently undergoing phase 2 trials in the US50. 


XLifeSc’s central platform is TAEST technology: TCR Affinity Enhanced Specific T-cells for NY-ESO-1 and 


specifically the TAEST 16001 product. On March 21, 2019 Athenex announced that XLifeSc had received IND 


approval from China National Medical Products Administration (formerly China FDA)51 for the TAEST 16001 


injection.

Figure 42 Athenex Announces Xiangxue Life Sciences Receives IND Allowance 


This product appears to be identical to the NY-ESO SPEAR T-cell therapy program currently being developed by 


GSK after acquiring the platform from Adaptimmune. Both products use enhanced affinity receptor T-cells to 


recognize a peptide shared by cancer antigens. How this happened is less than coincidence.  


The star of XLifeSc is Dr. Yi Li, formerly of the Guangzhou Institute of Biomedicine and Health which he joined in 


December 2011 as part of the Thousand Talents Program.  





Figure 43 Dr Yi Li profile (translated)52 


The program, designed to facilitate an influx of know-how and expertise to China, has been criticized by several 


US governmental bodies for facilitating theft of intellectual property53.  


Prior to returning to China Dr. Li worked at Adaptimmune’s sister company Immunocore and was credited in 


several papers regarding T-cell therapy as well as several patents held by Immunocore and Adaptimmune54, 55.

Figure 45 Immunocore patent list56 


In a submission for a clinical trial conducted by Xiangxue Life Sciences, Dr. Li claims to have developed the anti-


NY-ESO-1-specific TCR in 200557, which while not strictly incorrect fails to mention he did this at another 


company: 


 
Figure 46 XLifeSc Phase 1 application 


On July 24, 2018 GSK and Adaptimmune announced transition completion for the NY-ESO SPEAR programme to 


GSK. A search of clinicaltrials.gov shows GSK’s trials are currently in phase 2 in the US. 


A point of clarity: we are not claiming that Dr. Li stole the technology currently being licensed by Athenex. We 


are simply remarking on the circumstances that led to Li leaving a UK company which later invented what 


appears to be an identical product to the one he developed in China in following years.

Viceroy Research Group 26 viceroyresearch.org 


We have serious reservations about the value of XLifeSc’s product offering and the decisions made by Athenex 


management in entering into a JV for a platform which has a better-funded competitor ahead in the regulatory 


schedule.

7. J Nick Riehle & Simon Pedder – Chelsea Therapeutics 


J. Nick Riehle joined Athenex in January 2017 and was appointed as CFO in February of that year, only to depart 


from the company in December 2017. Prior to this Riehle was CFO at Chelsea Therapeutics: he was in good 


company at Athenex.  A year earlier Athenex announced the addition of former Chelsea CEO and President 


Simon Pedder58 as Chief Business and Strategy Officer, Proprietary Products.  


We believe that the story that unfolded at Chelsea is the same as the one unfolding at Athenex: management 


misrepresenting a drug’s chances of FDA approval to fleece investors. 


Chelsea attempted and failed to receive FDA approval for its drug Northera to treat primary autonomic failure 


and its executives were later the subject of a shareholder class action for, among other things, failing to provide 


an accurate representation of the success of clinical trials and FDA meetings.  


This led to a shareholder class action which gives us an insight to what was happening at the company. 








 
Figures 47, 48 & 49 Extracts from Case 3:12-cv-00213-MO&-DCK 


Northera’s clinical trials were unable to achieve their primary endpoints in all but one trial, which only lasted a 


week and used a highly disputed assessment tool. All other trials (which had longer treatment periods) either 


failed to meet their primary endpoints or were abandoned after interim analyses showed they would not meet 


their endpoints. 


The FDA were in communication with Chelsea about these issues including their assessment tools, the need for 


further confirmatory studies and evidence of long-term improvements. The drug also resulted in increased 


incidences of death, adverse effects, strokes, myocardial infarctions and worsening of conditions. 


Throughout the class period Pedder, Riehle and other Chelsea executives represented to investors that all was 


progressing well with the Northera trials and that FDA approval was all but guaranteed. This culminated in the 


FDA finally denying approval of Northera on March 28, 2012. 


Any reputable company would avoid individuals so closely involved with this farce, but not Athenex!

Viceroy Research Group 28 viceroyresearch.org 


Another piece of the puzzle: there are several circumstances around Riehle’s tenure and departure which we 


view as strange. The reasons cited by the company were Riehle’s “planned” retirement from full-time 


employment to spend more time with his family59; no prior notice was given to investors that Athenex’s CFO 


intended to retire. 


Additionally, 10 months as an exceptionally short tenure for a CFO of a freshly listed company. Riehle doesn’t 


appear to have retired at all: his LinkedIn profile shows he now acts as an independent consultant and his resume 


website is still active and bears a 2019 date60.  


8. Conclusion 


Athenex has a net-cash balance sheet as of its most recent financial statements, however also burnt over $110m 


cash in the last 12 months. The company’s licensing and consulting segments both appear to be operationally 


loss making and have plateaued over the last 6 months (LTM June 30, 2019 revenues down against CY 2018). 


These revenue streams may be worth a nominal amount to the right buyer. 


Optimistically, we value Athenex at $2.83 per share, which is the sum of its tangible book 


value and a 1x valuation on its revenue streams, both for the year ending June 30, 2019. 


This suggests a 71% downside. 


Athenex is a perfect storm of investor deception, insider enrichment and clinical trial risks.  


We have no faith in the trial methodology being used by Athenex and do not believe that Oraxol’s true market 


potential has been represented to investors. Beyond that the history of the Orascovery program and 


involvement with CROs shows a complete disregard for best practices and an intention to manipulate data. 


Athenex itself has become a self-enrichment tool for its directors and insiders: investors interests are not being 


protected at all. Management and the board of directors are either complicit, complacent or completely 


inadequate to the task. At this point the company appears to exist solely to transfer cash to China, a jurisdiction 


notoriously hard to repatriate it from.  


Investors should demand a full investigation of the issues discussed within this report: we are confident there 


is more to this story given how much was available purely through the public domain.
