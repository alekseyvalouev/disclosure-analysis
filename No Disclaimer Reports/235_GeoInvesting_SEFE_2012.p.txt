Sefe Inc.'s Hot Air Balloon About To Burst

by: The GeoTeam


After exposing numerous Chinese reverse merger frauds we recently added to our focus
the identification of U.S. companies that may be misrepresenting their stories to
investors. Our piece on Raystream (OTC:RAYS) was our inaugural U.S. Pump & Dump
(P&D) fraud report. We highlighted our RAYS expose on 12/08/2011 at $1.75 and followed
up with a 40 page report on 12/29/2011. The stock now trades under $0.40. There are
now new issues regarding the RAYS story including our findings that the company has
collapsed its German operating subsidiary, yet to be disclosed in U.S. filings. Has
Raystream written its final epitaph?


Our curiosity is now piqued by Sefe (OTC:SEFE).


We view SEFE no differently than any other Pump & Dump that use exaggerations of the
truth and sexy story lines for which promoters at times spend millions of dollars to
orchestrate massive pump moves. The stock has risen from $0.64 on 2/24/ 2012,
reaching a high of $2.96 on 3/25/2012.


Buyers Beware


The pump and dump universe is just a game of who will be the greater fool holding the
bag? And we bet the promoters who get paid in stock will not be those fools. Neither will
large holders of SEFE stock as is evident by a schedule D filed on April 13, 2012 revealing
that investors, including insiders, registered to sell $8 million worth of shares.


"Third parties" have spent at least five million dollars to peddle this story to unsuspecting
investors by utilizing some of the most notorious promotional organizations out there such
as Stocks Digest Magazine (received $2.5 million in cash and $2.5 million in shares),
Stock Hunter, The Stock Detective and Awesomestocks.


SEFE is being promoted by the same outfits that successfully pumped the Sunpeaks
Ventures (SNPK.OB) story. However, in just one day SNPK gave back nearly all of its
massive gains and now trades at around $0.50. SNPK pumped from $0.42 on 3/8/2012 to
$2.40 on 4/18/2012 before experiencing its first massive dump on the same day, reaching
a low of $0.55.

On April 18, 2012 SEFE was also eager to announce that it had signed a term sheet for
$2 million in financing with its financial partner, Riverbend, LLC. The company stated:


"it has signed a term sheet for $2 million in financing through a nonconvertible
preferred debenture. A debt structure was chosen rather than equity financing in
order to preserve shareholder value and avoid dilution."


What SEFE failed to mention in the press release was that they issued Riverbend
warrants to purchase 500,000 shares of stock at $1.00. Management only later discloses
this fact in an 8k filed on April, 25 2012.


Notice that we have not even mentioned what SEFE does yet. That is because we do not
believe it matters. We could stop writing the article at this point since all investors really
need to know is that legitimate companies will likely not find themselves associated with
what many consider pump and dump outfits. Furthermore, from our point of view, with 50
million shares outstanding and no revenues, the capital structure makes this story a no go
from the get go when you consider the funds this development stage company will have to
raise to generate revenues, if you want to even believe they have a legitimate
operation. But let's move on.


History Reveals More Red Flags


SEFE was incorporated in the State of Nevada on September 24, 2004 under the name,
Midnight Candle Co., a failed business venture. On July 16, 2010 Midnight Candle
purchased intellectual property rights, via the issuance of 30 million shares, to a firm
called SEFE, Inc. Thus, SEFE the public company was born. Since this transaction, the
company has raised $637,000 from stock offerings and amassed around $600,000 in debt
in from July 16, 2010 through March 11, 2011. The July 16 asset acquisition included a
related party transaction:


"Pursuant to the July 16, 2010 Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement, the
Company assumed liabilities totaling $250,000 in the form of convertible notes
payable, due equitably to two holders, one of which is a related party entity."


All told, two of the debt obligations from July 16, 2010 through March 11, 2011 originated
from related party transactions and were eventually sold to "other individuals" and were
converted into 9 million shares (to settle "defaults").

Predictably, as of December 31, 2011 the company had already converted $370,000 of
defaulted debt into 11.8 million shares of SEFE stock to settle its debts. At December's 31,
2011 closing price these shares were worth $5.9 million. At SEFE's peak price of $2.96 on
March 25, 2011, the shares were worth $35 million. As gleaned from the 2011 10k, all told
the company:


"will have arranged with our note holders to convert $590,000 of our bridge notes,
into 17,999,998 shares of our common stock"


What does SEFE have to show for these fund raising activities?


Zero revenue
Defaults on all five debt instruments issued from July 16, 2010 through March 11,
2011.
Some investors that have likely made a handsome sum of money from a company that
has yet to generate one penny of revenues.


Are We Starting to See a Reason for a Pump and Dump Campaign?


So what is this business plan that has yielded no revenues and numerous defaults on
debt?


All we had to do was read SEFE's description to postulate that something is not right:


"SEFE focuses on pushing the boundaries of what's possible, embracing innovation
and employing the cutting-edge to solve problems, and offering sustainable solutions
to a world hungry for invention, direction and leadership. SEFE is technology- and
solutions-driven, focusing on developing inventions that provide a real-world impact
and true profitability. So, success is measured by both a sustainable return on
investment, as well as a project's sustainability from an environmental perspective."


We had no idea what this meant, so we continued to probe into SEFE's business plan.


SEFE has produced a video that can be viewed directly on its website which gives a
general overview of the concepts regarding how the technology would work. The premise
of the technology is to float some sort of tethered balloon in the lower atmosphere,
capable of collecting electrostatic energy that would be sold to utility and mining
companies.

The company is not explicit on how much energy could be produced. Furthermore,
SEFE's Director of engineering, Michael Hurowitz, poses a serious question in the video
that, on the surface, seems to raise some doubt in the viability of the company's
technology:


"The big question for us? Can we design a system to harness this high voltage
electrostatic energy in a significant way?"


Are you telling us that this stock is worth tens of millions of dollars ($153 million market
cap at a peak price of $2.96) on a system with a rather large QUESTION MARK?


The 2011 10k issued on March 29, 2012 confirms that the company has no product to
market:


"We currently have no marketable units and therefore have not begun to
distribute any products."


And even if we wanted to believe that SEFE was on the cusp of some ground breaking
technology we presume it could take years before it would be able to bring a product to
market. Although we are by no means experts in the arena of harnessing power from
unproven methods, we can still assume that regulatory approval would likely first be
needed from the likes of the Department of Energy (DOE) or the Federal Aviation
Administration since an object would be permanently floating in the sky.

Grass Roots


Given our findings we were surprised to see a Market Wire press release issued by Grass
Roots Research that helped inspire a massive multi-day run in SEFE shares from $1.65
on April 23, 2012 to $2.96 in mid-day trading on April 25, 2012. Grass Roots research
dubs themselves as the #1 small cap research firm. On April 23, 2012 they issued the
paid-for bullish report (for which they received $15,000) on SEFE with a price target of
$5.95.


We urge investors to visit Grass Roots website and decide for themselves if this
"research" outfit follows impressive small cap companies.


Grass Roots offers up an impressive looking financial model that predicts SEFE will see its
revenues explode from $1.6 million in 2013 to $279.8 million in 2019 with pretax margins
ranging from 41% to 56%. Grass Roots estimates that this enviable growth will be
accomplished by issuing no debt and just $5 million worth of stock. What they may have
failed to do is read SEFE's 2011 10K which states the following:


"We are actively raising additional capital by conducting additional issuances of our
equity and debt securities for cash."


There are other reasons to believe that Grass Roots did not pay close enough attention to
SEFE's filings. The firm estimates that total operating expenses will amount to $600,000 in
2013 and just $1.2 million in 2014. Yet, the 2011 10K shows that SEFE incurred operating
expenses of $900,00 on zero sales, before even "ramping" up alleged operations. Is it
logical that operating expenses will go down as SEFE spends dollars to test,
develop and market their product? We view the Grass Roots report as a fluff piece to
