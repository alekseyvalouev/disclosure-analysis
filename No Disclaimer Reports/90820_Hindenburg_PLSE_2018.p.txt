Summary:  Pulse Biosciences (PLSE)
Pulse failed to achieve an FDA 510(k) clearance which it had previously described as a


“foundation for future clearances”. The current direction of the company seems highly


uncertain.


The company and several directors have been subpoenaed as part a newly disclosed SEC


investigation into potential insider trading around a company news release.


Any future avenues are likely to be capital-intensive. Per the 10-K, “…we plan to raise


additional capital in the future”.


Bottom line: Pulse is focused on a technology that doesn’t seem to work well. Limited


oncological studies show poor to mixed results. Aesthetic applications thus far have


insigni�cant potential.


We think Pulse is stuck in a precarious position, and the current stock price in no way


re�ects the risks, capital needs, and the looming regulatory overhang facing the company.

Pulse Biosciences: Failed FDA Clearance,
New SEC Investigation, And An Uncertain
Path Forward


Published on April 24, 2018

Virtually, all of Pulse Bioscience’s (NASDAQ:PLSE (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/PLSE)) eggs


are in one basket: The company is focused on developing its “Nano-Pulse Stimulation” (NPS)


technology, which exposes cells to electrical pulses in an e�ort to kill them.


The technology doesn’t appear to work all that well, as recent oncological data on humans


(https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3946678/) and canines


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1625101/000162510118000012/plse-


20171231x10k.htm) has shown.


Further underscoring questions around the e�cacy of the device, the company withdrew its


510(k) application with the FDA and then recently disclosed that it would not be resubmitting


the application. A 510(k) clearance would have given the Pulse a general indication for soft


tissue ablation which the company at various times referred to as “the �rst step in our


strategy”, the “foundation for future clearances” and an “important milestone en route to


commercialization”. We believe the decision to not resubmit was made because the company


was unable to produce data showing the device to be as safe and e�ective as other


commercially available devices.


In the absence of the above foundational step, the company’s new “strategy” seems mired in


uncertainty. In lieu of a general 510(k) indication, the company is instead seeking to pursue


speci�c indications in either oncology or dermatology/aesthetics with no clear priority or


timeline in place for any potential indications.


Chasing speci�c indications would likely be cost-intensive and resource-intensive, which could


spell the need for further capital injections. The company plainly acknowledged plans to raise


more capital in the recent 10-K:


…we plan to raise additional capital in the future.


In another troubling sign, Pulse has also acknowledged that the company and several directors


have received SEC subpoenas in relation to potential insider trading ahead of a company news


announcement. The investigation represents a signi�cant new overhang.


Collectively, we think Pulse Biosciences is in a tremendous amount of trouble. We believe the


current stock price in no way re�ects the risks, capital needs, and the looming regulatory


overhang facing the company.

Pulse’s Failure to Achieve FDA 510(k) Clearance
Looks Like a Major Setback


In March 2017, Pulse submitted a 510(k) application to the FDA to approve its device for a


general indication for soft tissue ablation. The CEO stated


(http://investors.pulsebiosciences.com/news-releases/news-release-details/pulse-biosciences-


submits-510k-application-fda-pulsetxtm-system), as part of the announcement, that this was:


the �rst step in our strategy to pursue a general indication for soft tissue ablation


followed by submissions for speci�c indications in the future.


The company reiterated the importance of the 510(k) clearance in its July 2017 Q2 conference


call (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4092339-pulse-biosciences-plse-ceo-darrin-uecker-q2-


2017-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single):


Our objective is to obtain a 510(k) clearance with an indication for soft tissue


ablation, which we believe can serve as a foundation for future clearances for


speci�c indications that we will pursue with the addition of clinical data. The


510(k) clearance for soft tissue ablation may also enable us to accelerate our


pursuit of additional pilot studies.


…pending positive results from our study, we intend to submit study data to the


FDA in support of a 510k submission sometime in 2018. Thanks to the e�orts of our


internal team and our network of clinical investigators. We are on schedule to


achieve this important milestone en route to commercialization.


In September 2017 (http://investors.pulsebiosciences.com/news-releases/news-release-


details/pulse-biosciences-announces-withdrawal-and-planned-resubmission), the company


voluntarily withdrew its application due to the FDA’s “appropriate request for additional data


that could not be provided within the Agency’s 90-day review period.” The company planned to


re�le the application and rea�rmed its commitment to submit the supplemental information


in a subsequent 510(k) application in the coming months. Pulse’s CEO expressed optimism that


it would achieve its objective:

Over the past several months, we have been engaged in very productive and positive


conversations with the FDA sta�, and we remain con�dent in our ability to obtain


a 510(k) clearance for the PulseTx System and more broadly for Nano-Pulse


Stimulation.


That con�dence looks to have been completely ablated based on the recent �ling and


conference call information. The company is now reporting that it has shifted gears and no


longer seeks a 510(k) clearance for a general indication. Per the conference call transcript


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4157275-pulse-biosciences-plse-ceo-darrin-uecker-q4-2017-


results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single):


Based on our ongoing dialogue with FDA, consultation with regulatory experts, recent


clinical progress and our clinical program plans, we have decided to focus our


regulatory e�orts on directly obtaining speci�c clinical indications as opposed to �rst


pursuing a general soft tissue ablation clearance followed by speci�c indications.


Minimal Clinical Data


The inference based on the company’s statements above seems to be that the data was simply


not there to support a 510(k) clearance. Digging deeper on that subject, in looking at the


minimal clinical data available on the technology, we see little reason for optimism.


In the human study referenced above, a total of 10 cancerous tumors across 3 patients were


treated. The treatment failed to eliminate cancer in 2/3 patients and only eliminated 7/10


tumors, an inferior result relative to other commercially available alternatives.


In a recent study for the treatment of advanced canine oral melanoma, 3 out of the 5 canines


treated were euthanized prior to the end of the 112-day study period due to progressive


disease. Of the two canines that survived the study period, one had a visible tumor at the end


of the study period and the other had “no visible tumor”. (2017 10-K Pg. 7) The company stated,


as part of this release, that no de�nitive conclusions can be drawn from the study, given the


limited number of animals, but nonetheless, the limited data doesn’t look promising.


An Uncertain Path Forward

The failure to achieve general 510(k) clearance is obviously a signi�cant blow to the company’s


original plan, but worse yet, there seems to be a lack of direction going forward. In the absence


of a general clearance, the company must now decide whether or what speci�c indications it


hopes to achieve.


The company’s statements on its own future seem mired in uncertainty on which path(s) it


intends to pursue:


We believe the most e�cient and e�ective use of our resources is to work with the FDA


and pursue to the speci�c indication in immune-oncology and potentially other


indications such as dermatology. These submissions may utilize the 510(k) de novo or


premarket approval process, depending on the speci�c indication. We will provide


additional details including timing on these submissions in the coming quarters.


The statement above seems to indicate that oncology is likely the favored route, but the studies


above have shown that oncological results to date have been less than favorable. Furthermore,


the recent 10-K couches the company’s oncological plans in language that is highly preliminary


(Pg. 7):


We are in the early stages of planning to initiate our �rst human clinical oncology


study in patients with unresectable in-transit melanoma. We continue working with


our KOLs to �nalize the study design in preparation for what will likely be an


investigational device exemption �ling with the FDA during the second half of 2018.


The company’s studies on dermatological/aesthetic treatment of benign skin lesions have


produced more promising results, such as with its recent study


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20180412006391/en/Pulse-Biosciences-


Announces-Positive-Results-Study-Evaluating) on seborrheic keratosis lesions. However, the


space has a very limited market that is expected to reach (https://globenewswire.com/news-

Reach-US-1-320-8-Million-By-2026-Credence-Research.html) only $1.3 billion by 2026.


Additionally, the niche is already crowded with alternatives


(https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/seborrheic-keratosis/diagnosis-treatment/drc-


20353882) such as a recently FDA-approved topical medication

(https://www.sanovadermatology.com/skin-lesions/fda-approves-eskata-for-treatment-of-


seborrheic-keratosis/) and other approaches such as cryoablation, curettage, electrocautery,


and laser ablation.


We think the company is in a very di�cult spot given the (i) questionable oncological data to


date and (ii) the limited market size and existing competition in the dermatological/aesthetic


arena.


While the company’s strategy remains uncertain, one thing seems almost de�nite: the


company will need plenty of R&D investment to chase a potential multitude of speci�c


indications.


The company had a cash burn of $3.9 million in the most recent quarter and $38.1 million in


cash, equivalents, and investments as of quarter-end. Given the recent burn rate, the company


would be able to keep the lights on for the foreseeable future but would need new capital to


pursue clinical studies and commercialization of its device. As stated in our initial bullet points,


the company left little doubt on this subject, stating quite candidly “we plan to raise additional


capital in the future.” (2017 10-K Pg 53

Newly Disclosed SEC Insider Trading
Investigation Could Foreshadow a Death Blow


We think the above already puts the company on precarious ground, but a newly disclosed SEC


investigation represents a major added uncertainty. Per the 10-K (Pg. 43

We and certain of our directors have received subpoenas from the Securities and


Exchange Commission requesting documents and other information in connection


with an investigation into trading in our stock in advance of our September 2017


announcement of the stock purchase agreement executed between us and Robert


Duggan. We are cooperating with the investigation. We cannot provide any assurance


as to the outcome of the investigation or that such outcome will not have a material


adverse e�ect on our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations, or


�nancial condition.


We reviewed the trading action during that period and noticed clear oddities.


The company announced the withdrawal of its 510(k) application on September 11, 2017,


which triggered a sharp and explainable sello�. Then, between September 14, 2017, to


September 18, 2017, a large surge in price and volume took place on no discernible news.


Some of the purchases in that date range were from Robert Duggan himself, as was reported


after the close on September 18th in an amended 13D �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1055919/000092189517002323/sc13da506922004_0


9182017.htm) which detailed his purchases from the 14th to 18th. Duggan represented only


about 10% of the total volume on those two days, however (and less than 10% over the 3-day


period.)


The volume on those days was aberrationally high, particularly on the 14th and 15th where


volume was 9.3x and 3.8x higher than its 3-month averages. The implication therefore seems


to be that others had also participated in the >50% price spike and did so in size.

Following this odd price action, weeks later, on October 2nd


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1625101/000162510117000033/plse-


20171002xex3_1.htm), the company changed its corporate bylaws to, among other things,


amend the process for removing directors and also provide strong indemni�cation protection


for any directors or former directors that may be subject to any civil, criminal, or administrative


proceeding. Per the new amended bylaws:


…the Corporation shall indemnify, to the fullest extent permitted by [Nevada law], as


now or hereinafter in e�ect, any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be


made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding,


whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a “Proceeding”)…


The new language also protects directors and o�cers in the case of a no contest plea “or its


equivalent”, and other adverse outcomes:


The termination of any Proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or


upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a


presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which such


person reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the


Corporation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable


cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
This seems to suggest that, for example, a potential settlement common to the SEC where


directors “neither con�rm nor deny” wrongdoing could be covered under the above language.


The language looks to be a signi�cant departure from older indemni�cation language. A


registration statement �led just months earlier in June was less forgiving:


…we shall not be required to indemnify any director or o�cer in connection with any


proceeding, or part thereof, initiated by such person unless such indemni�cation: (a)


is expressly required to be made by law, (b) the proceeding was authorized by our


board of directors, (c) is provided by us, in our sole discretion, pursuant to the powers


vested in us under Nevada law or (d) is required to be made pursuant to the bylaws.


The old language detailed protections o�ered to o�cers and directors but also carved out


additional exceptions to liability protection, including (Part II-1):


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1625101/000156276217000089/plse-


20170630xs3.htm)


(a) a willful failure to deal fairly with the company or its stockholders in connection


with a matter in which the director has a material con�ict of interest; (b) a violation of


criminal law, unless the director had reasonable cause to believe that his or her


conduct was lawful or no reasonable cause to believe that his or her conduct was


unlawful; (c) a transaction from which the director derived an improper personal


pro�t; and (d) willful misconduct.


In short, the new amendments to the corporate bylaws look designed to protect o�cers and


directors in the event of the very type of proceeding that could result if the SEC investigation


leads to an enforcement action. It could all be a coincidence, but given that the amendments


were made right on the heels of the issue that triggered the investigation, we can’t help but


�nd the timing to be prescient. In either case, the changes to look incredibly unfriendly to


common shareholders should any director or o�cer be subject to an enforcement action going


forward.


Given the revised language, a potential regulatory action could represent a major drain on


shareholder capital (along with a host of other rami�cations.)

Conclusion


We don’t think Pulse Biosciences is a complex story. It boils down to a technology that sounds


interesting but doesn’t seem to work that well. It happens. The poor study results, the failure to


secure a 510(k) clearance, and the need to pursue more expensive speci�c indications are all


symptoms of that core issue.


We think investors in Pulse had been enamored by the support of a billionaire and have likely


stopped paying attention to the failures of the company along the way since that point.


The SEC investigation and the events that both apparently triggered and followed the triggering


events give us concerns about a potential looming regulatory liability. Given the new


indemni�cation language, such a potential liability now seems more likely to be shouldered by


shareholders rather than those responsible.


At this point, the stock doesn’t seem to re�ect the weight of current realities, and we believe


fair value to be closer to $4 per share in the absence of meaningful new positive clinical data.


We wish the best of luck to all.
