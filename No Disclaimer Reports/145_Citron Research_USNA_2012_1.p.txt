Usana:  You DO NOT Have the Right to Remain Silent 


 
Introduction / Background (NASDAQ:USNA) 
 


Macro-trends:  Revenue and margin squeeze in the direct distributor “potions and 
lotions” industry: 
 
Multi-Level Marketing companies are making headlines lately, as they all delicately walk the lines of 
legality of their business models.  These companies stray increasingly into boundary-pushing "risky 
business" because most all of them are exhibiting telltale signs of market saturation in the US and 
developed countries.   Inevitably, as their "independent distributors / sales associates" realize that the 
vast majority at the bottom of the "downstream" will never make any money, these sales pyramid 
companies are flogged until they saturate their markets, at which point growth atrophies.  One obvious 
symptom is excessive churn rates among distributors.  As the number of genuinely profitable resellers 
plateaus, 90% of new recruits lose money, and sales growth fades.     
 
In the US and Europe, revenue growth rates for all the MLM companies are now down to single digits 
at best.  Meanwhile, distributor counts in these regions are actually shrinking across the industry, 
despite the high unemployment numbers that might attract idle members of the workforce to try their 
hand at direct sales.   
 
In their thirst for growth, these companies naturally have set their sights on exploiting Asia and the 
Pacific Rim and ultimately China to postpone the inevitable multiple compression, and keep their stock 
prices inflated as long as possible.  Compelled by market's insatiable demand for growth, they are 
forced to keep demonstrating those growing-to-the-sky uptrending charts, even though the quality and 
therefore sustainability of their  business is increasingly suspect.   
 
This is why China is now of such a crucial importance to these companies.  Grass-roots 
entrepreneurship is still a new theme within the Chinese culture, and the social pressure to develop 
personal wealth so as to achieve family economic security is enormous.    
 
All these companies face the same problem:  they craft complex over-the-rainbow commission 
schemes to compensate their "independent distributors", which inevitably place a huge incentive on 
recruiting new distributors.  Newly recruited distributors always find themselves obligated to maintain 
minimum order amounts to maintain their eligibility for commissions.  Often this results in 
“subscription” commitments to buy inventory, which pile up in basements and garages.  And of course,
Citron Research on USANA (NASDAQ:USNA) Nov 29, 2012  Page 2 of 18 
 


the companies can't possibly be expected to track the revenue from sales which are legitimately 
consumed by non-distributors, can they?   
 
In prior articles in Citron Reports, as well as a recent Fortune Magazine article, NuSkin's multi-level 
scheme in China has been exposed.  But as bad as NuSkin's exploitation in China has been, Usana's is 
even further beyond the bounds of legality. 
 


But MLM's and pyramid compensation schemes are strictly illegal in China.   
When it comes to China, there’s one insurmountable problem:  Multi-Level Marketing companies and 
their pyramid compensation schemes are completely illegal in mainland China.   The MLM companies 
resort to one version of hanky-panky or another to show outscale growth rates from within China, 
which they add into their results to maintain their multiples.  But they’re all short on details about how 
they actually accomplish it operationally.    Below are a couple of examples of curious analysts’ 
attempts to gain “clarity” about China revenues. 
 


USANA: Can Investors Count on Management for Disclosure?   
US-domiciled MLM businesses like Usana have adopted various strategies to set up “legitimate” 
operations to provide camouflage for their mischief in China.  Usana paid heavily (over 4x revenues) to 
acquire a small baby products company in order to obtain a coveted “direct sales” license in China.  
(Note: these licenses do not permit any sort of multi-level compensation pyramids, just direct 
commissions to salespersons for bona fide consumer sales.)   
 
But commissioned direct sales of these products cannot possibly support levels of gross revenues and 
profits necessary to move the needle for the company.  Instead, it has temporarily provided "cover" 
while it established a pyramid sales operation in Mainland China using Hong Kong banks. 
 
For Usana management, at what point are they obligated to start disclosing the real risks of trying to 
do business there?   
 


It is Citron’s opinion that the bright line is when material events occur.  Like when Usana 
distributors are arrested and fined?  Or when the SAIC, an official Chinese government 
agency, advises internet posters that being an Usana distributor is illegal?   
 
Let's examine the gap between management's statements and reality here.  Citron recalls only a few 
prior companies of interest where management's answers are so far from reality – and the 
consequences have always been devastating.

   What Usana Management states (and leaves unsaid) about its

quarter 2012 USNA conference call.  Surely these guys have had plenty of time to get their mainland 
China story figured out for public consumption by now, right?  But … nope:   


John San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC 


Do you know what the percentage of your Hong Kong associates 


that are actually Chinese nationals? Do you know what that 


percentage is, by any chance? 


David Wentz - Chief Executive Officer 


No, we do not. 


John San Marco - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC 


Okay. I mean ballpark? I mean it's pretty -- is it substantial? Or you 


can't even render a guess? A ballpark guess? 


David Wentz - Chief Executive Officer 


We definitely have a number of people who are building in Hong 


Kong. We do not have a percentage or have a number that we 


could point to with any accuracy.   [ Link … ]

Q & A from 3
rd


 quarter, 2012 conference call: 
 


 
 
The company has had 15 months since then to tell investors what is really going on in China with 
regard to Usana's business prospects.  They haven't said a word about any of the numerous material 
events that imperil Usana's China operations.  This provides the background in which Citron reports 
what Usana is really doing in Mainland China. 


Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division 


I may have missed it and I know you had strong results in Greater 


China, but would you mind giving us a little granularity over what 


happened with mainland versus Hong Kong? Because that's kind of 


been a source of interesting shifts in sales in previous periods? 


G. Douglas Hekking - Chief Financial Officer 


We saw north of 20% growth in each of those markets and also 


strong growth in Taiwan. So we continue to see growth overall in 


the Greater China region. 


Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division 


Can you give us a little more specificity than just the north of 20%. I 


mean, I think you're up, what, 27% overall? 


G. Douglas Hekking - Chief Financial Officer 


Yes. We see that the mainland China outpacing the rest of the 


markets. But like I said, we're running essentially as one region 


now and we kind of look at it as one, but... 


Timothy S. Ramey - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division 


Great. Okay. And would you say the same for -- I mean obviously, a 


big increase in recruitment as well. Does that track kind of the sales 


pattern? 


G. Douglas Hekking - Chief Financial Officer 


Yes. The active customer accounts that you see are well-correlated 


in the Greater China region. Absolutely.

And specifically, this TV News segment should really be of concern to investors: 
http://www.t-d.tv/2012/09/29/VIDE1348885122947185.shtml 
 
First, note the date:  Sept 29, 2012.  TV news report on a recent encounter with a salesman visiting Mr. Shen's 
family, promoting Usana's nutritional products.  The packaged product does not carry serialized licensing 
number, is not registered with the Chinese equivalent of the FDA, and is not labeled and does not provide 
instructions in Chinese; all of which are conditions which render such product sales illegal in China.   
 
The interviewee further observes that the product contains common ingredients which are available from other 
popular domestic products at lower cost.

Usana reps are being apprehended and put out of business, with income 
disgorgement and fines.  
Why hasn't the company disclosed these as risk factors?

4)   Investigation reveals Usana managers actively 
participating in creating illegal pyramid compensation scheme to 
circumvent China's anti-MLM laws: 
 
What Citron did:  
To uncover how the scheme works, Citron's investigators signed up as Usana reps to penetrate the Usana 
pyramid. 
 


What Citron found: 
Prospective Usana reps from mainland China travel to Hong Kong, where they are instructed by Usana reps on 
how to illegally open Hong Kong Bank Accounts, using a proxy address, and to direct the illegal pyramid 
compensation so it circumvents China's anti-pyramid scheme laws.   
 
And this is not just a rogue phenomenon at the far fringes of the business operation.  What makes this so bad is 
it proves that not only is Usana operating illegally in China, the company is abetting Chinese citizens in breaking 
the law . 
 
Bring on the evidence.

Ada explains in great detail how to use her own (Ada's) Hong Kong address, how to open a Hong Kong Bank 
account, how to use Ada's address for downlines recruited in Mainland China, and how Ada will open their bank 
accounts at the same bank so they can get paid.  And of course how Ada would expect some type of gift in 
exchange for helping to open these accounts.  
 
Our contact attempted to open a bank account at the Bank of China, but was refused when she disclosed that 
the purpose of the account was to facilitate Usana business.  She was informed by the bank lobby manager that 
"Many Mainlanders do business with Usana, and they all use China Merchants Bank," and referred her there to 
open an account.   
 
Ada Chai offers to take our contact to open a bank account at China Merchants Bank.  Then back to Usana's 
headquarters to complete her "Auto-Pay/auto-Deposit Agreement" with her new Hong Kong bank account 
number, and then out to dinner!   Ada explicitly explains the reason to use her (Ada's) address, not her own, is 
that there is no Usana in Mainland China; therefore she needs to sign up as a Usana distributor with a Hong 
Kong identity.   
 
There was other disturbing advice given as well; such as to avoid shipping fees, someone could pick up her order 
from Usana to mail her the products for less than half what Usana would charge for small orders.  (Hello!   
Anybody think this violates China's import laws?)   
Here's his business card:
Citron Research on USANA (NASDAQ:USNA) Nov 29, 2012  Page 15 of 18 
 


 
 
Our contact asked Ada again if she would be allowed to sign up distributors in Mainland China.  Ada told her yes, 
she would be able to, but there would be a few problems.  And every problem has a solution.  Both the main 
obstacles were a Hong Kong address and a Hong Kong bank account, and Ada knows how to handle both of 
these.  
 
Here's the starter kit our contact purchased at the end of her visit:
Citron Research on USANA (NASDAQ:USNA) Nov 29, 2012  Page 16 of 18 
 


 
 
In fact, our contact obtained images of the complete Usana Distributors Manual, in Chinese and English, which 
spells out Usana's entire compensation scheme.  Our contact was advised by Ada Chai (and is recorded) that 
everything in the book about downlines and pay structures applies to her prospective sales activities of Usana 
products in Mainland China.
Citron Research on USANA (NASDAQ:USNA) Nov 29, 2012  Page 17 of 18 
 





5)     Recent updates:   HK Bank Account with false 
address leads to directly to establishing illegal downline sales rep in 
Mainland China:  Entire scheme is structured to circumvent PRC's 
anti-MLM laws.  
 
Our research didn't end with this preliminary visit, however.  In fact, the contact proceeded to follow the 
instructions as given, open the requisite HK bank account, and become a Usana rep.   With the explicit 
understanding that she was going to recruit a downstream in mainland China, she proceeded to do just that; and 
as a bonus, obtained additional downlines given to her by Ada Chai.  (common practice because of limitations on 
the number of direct downline "slots" in the Usana compensation scheme.   
 
The left side of this tree represents the operative's recruited downline; those on the right (shown here) are reps 
added by Ada Chai and are unknown to the researcher.  (A graphic of the complete tree is linked below.)

     Conclusion: 
The obtained evidence presented here unequivocally supports the conclusion that Usana is blatantly 
operating an MLM pyramid in China, and this activity is endemic -- not the fringe behavior of a few 
rogue distributors.  This activity stretches far beyond the cover provided by the nascent baby products 
company which Usana purchased for the purpose of obtaining a direct sales license in China. 
 
From a regulatory perspective, U. S. investors have to ask how long this scheme can be used to buttress 
the company's claims of double-digit top and bottom line growth.  At worst, management is lying about 
all this.  But at a minimum, they aren't disclosing the real risks of their business to investors or the SEC.  
 
When we see distributors being arrested, and when the company's representatives teaching people 
how to evade Chinese laws, they are willfully abetting the laws of a sovereign country.   
 
So how can Usana claim sustainability for its strategy in China?  How can analysts hang a generous P/E 
multiple on growth generated this way, while encouraging investors to buy the stock up to 
unsupportable price targets?  Are investors simply left to speculate about the risks in Usana's ability to 
"influence" public officials to keep the game going?  (Of course, all bribes made by employees of US 
companies to gain business in foreign countries are explicitly illegal under the Federal Foreign Corrupt 
Practices Act.  ) 
 
 


Risk Factor: 
If in fact the Chinese Government is going to give a free pass to Usana and Nu Skin in order to prove 
Citron wrong … then the writer of this article is going to run for Governor of Utah.
