Introduction 


We are short GTT Communications, Inc. (GTT US) because we believe it is an over-levered, 


fundamentally broken business that uses non-GAAP metrics to conceal its lack of organic growth 


and cash flow from investors. GTT lost -$71 million and -$243 million in 2017 and 2018, and by our 


calculations, generated negative organic growth of -8.7% and -7.7% in 2017 and 2018. Despite these 


awful metrics, senior management has received $37 million in bonuses because GTT’s compensation 


plan effectively incentivizes value destruction through indiscriminate acquisitions. 


GTT’s management keeps this self-enriching process going by deliberately creating financial opacity 


in the following ways: 


• GTT does not disclose its organic growth rate to investors. We calculated GTT’s organic 


growth rate to be -8.7% and -7.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. With negative organic 


growth, no more accounting levers to pull and nowhere near enough free cash flow to 


service its debt, we believe GTT is a fundamentally broken rollup. 


• GTT inflated its operating profit by almost $80 million in 2018 by significantly stretching its 


depreciation and amortization periods and revaluing acquired assets. Had they not made 


these adjustments, GTT would have reported an operating loss of almost $40 million last 


year.  


• GTT’s net debt has grown from $700 million at the end of 2016 to approximately $3.2 


billion as of March 31, 2019, bringing GTT’s debt-to-equity ratio up to 996%. GTT’s 


trailing 12-month cash conversion rate (OCF/Sales) is 5.1%. With management’s guidance 


of capex at 7% of revenue, it is mathematically impossible for GTT to generate positive free 


cash flow.  


• GTT’s executive compensation structure has, in our opinion, incentivized value destruction. 


In the last two years, GTT has posted record losses of $71.2 million and $243.4 million 


while GTT’s top three executives were awarded record compensation of $18.3 million and 


$19.3 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively.  


GTT’s executive compensation plans have caused management to deviate significantly from its 


stated strategy of growth through small, strategic acquisitions. Instead, GTT has made massive 


acquisitions of declining, unprofitable businesses in 2017 and 2018, regardless of their impact on the 


company’s leverage and profitability.  


GTT’s net debt-to-EBITDA is 10.9x – more than double the adjusted EBITDA-based leverage 


metric that GTT highlights to its investors. We believe GTT’s unsustainable cash burn rate and debt 


burden leaves GTT needing a large, dilutive equity raise – which would only buy more time, without 


addressing the underlying problems.  


The main problem is that GTT does not generate organic growth or enough free cash flow to service 


its debt.

1. Organic Growth (or in this case, negative organic growth): 


• GTT is reliant on acquisitions for growth, masking the company’s negative organic 


growth. According to our calculations, GTT posted terrible organic growth of -8.7% 


and -7.7% in 2017 and 2018, respectively. Unlike many of its competitors, GTT does 


not disclose its organic growth rate to investors.  


• GTT obfuscates its negative organic growth by tucking in the revenue from what it 


characterizes as “immaterial acquisitions.” However, since GTT makes one or two of 


these each quarter, in aggregate, they quickly become material, in our opinion. GTT 


has paid $267.1 million (about 18% of its 2018 revenue) for these “immaterial 


acquisitions” since the beginning of 2016.  


• Because no financials were provided by GTT for these so-called “immaterial 


acquisitions,” GTT is able to create the appearance of organic growth that simply 


does not exist. We took it upon ourselves to pull filings from The Netherlands and the 


National Stock Exchange of India to calculate GTT’s real organic growth.  





2. Math is a Science; Accounting is an Art Form – Tools for Financial Engineering: 


• GTT inflated its financial performance by $78.7 million in 2018 by significantly 
revaluing the assets acquired from Interoute post-close and extending the depreciation 


and amortization periods for these assets. By our calculation, GTT would have posted 


an operating loss of nearly $40 million in 2018, compared to the company’s reported 


operating profit of $39.7 million.  


• These same accounting adjustments took GTT’s Q1 2019 operating income from a 


mere $800,000 to the $38.7 million reported by the company. 


• GTT marked up the carrying value of Interoute’s PP&E by $492 million upon 


acquisition, then by an additional $422 million 6 months later, for a total markup of 


$914 million, or 175%. Concurrent to marking up Interoute’s PP&E, GTT also 


marked the carrying value of Interoute’s customer lists down by 70%, or $408.5 


million, implying that 70% of Interoute’s customers churned in the first 6 months 


post-acquisition.  


• GTT can depreciate PP&E up to twice as long as it can amortize intangible assets like 


customer lists, which, as it stands, will inflate GTT’s financial performance by as 


much as $151.6 million in 2019. You can see our calculations in Appendix B of this 


report. 


• Between Q3 and Q4 2018, GTT extended the useful lives (or depreciation period) of 


its fiber optic cable assets from “20 years” to “20 to 40 years.” We asked a C-Suite 


executive from one of GTT’s competitors about this depreciation period for fiber and 


he told us the following: “No one else in the industry uses a 40-year depreciation. 


The industry standard for pretty much everyone from AT&T to Verizon to 


CenturyLink to Cogent is generally 20 years. Sometimes 15 but most cases 20.”  


• GTT extended its amortization period for acquired customer lists in three consecutive 


years; from 3 to 7 years in 2016 to 3 to 10 years in 2017 to 3 to 20 years in 2018.

3. Free Cash Flow and Debt Service: 


• Net debt has grown from $700.9 million at the end of 2016 to $3.178 billion as of 


March 31, 2019. Yet, only 5.1% of GTT’s revenue was converted into operating cash 


flow (“OCF”) over the last 12 months, which ranks GTT second worst among its 12 


closest competitors, whose weighted average cash flow conversion rate is 21.5%. 


• With GTT’s poor trailing twelve-month cash conversion rate of 5.1%, and 


management’s guidance for capex of 7% of revenue, it is mathematically impossible 


for GTT to generate free cash flow unless it can significantly improve cash 


conversion. (OCF – Capex = FCF) 


• GTT ended Q1 2019 with only $50.7 million of cash on-hand, including an additional 


$26 million drawn from its revolving credit facility – we believe GTT’s cash 


conversion issues and $50 million of quarterly interest expense have created a 


dangerous liquidity crunch for GTT. 





4. Pro Forma Financials and Unrealized Synergies: 


• GTT’s net debt to EBITDA is approximately 10.9x using standard EBITDA, or 


approximately 7.8x using GTT’s definition of adjusted EBITDA. Both of these would 


violate GTT’s 6.5x maximum leverage covenant, which drops to 6.25x at the end of 


Q3 2019.  


• Somehow, GTT was able lower its leverage ratio to 5.0x at the end of Q1 2019 using 


“customized” synergies that are presented only in its “Private Lender Presentation,” 


which is not available for GTT’s shareholders to review. 


• GTT removed the pro forma revenue and adjusted EBITDA slides from its Q4 2018 


investor presentation and, in doing so, further obfuscates the deterioration of its 


financial performance from investors. 





5. Executive Compensation – Incentivizing Value Destruction:  


• GTT’s “performance-based” executive compensation plans incentivize acquisitions 


which we believe destroy shareholder value and allow management to reap the 


rewards of inorganic growth while ignoring the massive risks that come with it. 


• In the last two years, GTT has posted record losses of $71.2 million and $243.4 


million while GTT’s top three executives were awarded record compensation of 


$18.3 million and $19.3 million in 2017 and 2018, respectively. 


• Since the beginning of 2017, GTT’s top three executives have sold $13.1 million of 


stock on the open market. These same executives have never made an open market 


purchase of GTT stock, that we could find. These sales are detailed in Appendix E of 


this report.

1. Organic Growth (or Lack Thereof) 


GTT obfuscated its negative organic growth rates of -8.7% and -7.7% in 2017 and 2018, 


respectively, by not providing financials for what it characterizes as “immaterial acquisitions” 


and “asset purchases of certain customer contracts.” The revenue from these so called 


“immaterial acquisitions” is simply tucked into the top line. In doing so, GTT deliberately 


creates opacity with respect to its true organic growth rate. Since GTT makes one or two of these 


“immaterial acquisitions” each quarter, in aggregate, they quickly become material, in our 


opinion. GTT has paid $267.1 million (about 18% of GTT’s 2018 revenue) for “immaterial 


acquisitions” and “purchases or certain customer contracts” since the beginning of 2016. In our 


opinion, this is absolutely material. 





Annual organic revenue analysis (USD, millions) 2017 2018 


 Revenue  827.9 1,490.8 


 Impact of:    
 Acquisition revenue - current period  (260.4) (526.3) 


 USF Fees and other surcharges  (17.4) (23.4) 


 Asset purchase  (37.6) - 


 Organic revenue  512.5 941.1 


 Previous period organic revenue base  561.5 1,019.6 


 Net change in organic revenue  (31.6) (78.5) 


    
 Reported revenue growth  57.0% 80.1% 


 Organic revenue growth (not reported by GTT) -8.7% -7.7% 


    
 USF and other surcharge adjustments  (19.9) (43.5) 


 Net installations  (11.7) (26.3) 








The table above makes it clear to us that the last two years have been an absolute disaster for 


GTT on the organic growth front. The stock fell more than 35% after posting a sequential 


revenue decline of 1% in Q1 2019 – we can only imagine what would happen to the stock price 


if GTT disclosed net installs of -$26.3 million, or its significant negative organic growth rates.  


According to GTT’s management, the company considers its smaller acquisitions to be an 


“organic activity” because GTT makes “immaterial acquisitions” so often and it is (apparently) 


cheaper than true organic growth – possibly because transaction, integration, restructuring and 


exit costs can be added back to adjusted EBITDA as well as adjusted unlevered free cash flow, 


two of the key determinants of GTT’s “performance-based” executive compensation plans.
Page 5 of 33 
 


Below are a few statements from GTT’s executives regarding the company’s “organic growth” 


strategy: 


“As Rick said, we do sort of the ground game for us is those smaller acquisitions that we 


do roughly one a quarter and we consider that more like an organic activity.” 


- CFO Mike Sicoli, Q2 2018 earnings call 


 “We add these smaller acquisitions and buying books of business which I call organic as 


well because it's a lot less expensive sometimes to buy those books than to take six 


months or nine months to build a sales organization to achieve that.” 


- Executive Chairman H. Brian Thompson, Q4 2017 earnings call 


“The organic part of our business is also the combination of small acquisitions.” 


- CEO Rick Calder, Q3 2018 earnings call 


We could not disagree more with these statements, since all acquisitions, regardless of their size, 


are inorganic growth by definition.  


In order to provide transparency into our organic growth calculations, we have provided the table 


below, which lists all of GTT’s acquisitions and asset purchases since the beginning of 2015 as 


well as the post-acquisition and annualized revenue numbers that we used in the organic growth 


calculations presented above.

For us to be as clear as possible about the length GTT goes to obscure its organic growth rate, we 


have broken it down quarter by quarter since Q1 2017. You can see in depth quarter-by-quarter 


calculations behind the numbers presented below in Appendix A of this report. 


Organic vs. Reported Revenue Growth Organic Reported Rev. 


Q1 2017 -1.0% 36.3% 


Q2 2017 -3.3% 2.2% 


Q3 2017 -1.3% 6.6% 


Q4 2017 -0.5% 23.0% 


Q1 2018 1.5% 4.6% 


Q2 2018 -3.6% 25.4% 


Q3 2018 -3.5% 37.3% 


Q4 2018 -0.9% 1.4% 


Q1 2019 -1.0% -1.0% 





Q4 2017 is the most bizarre example of GTT’s efforts to obfuscate its organic growth 


capabilities. GTT made a buzzer-beating acquisition of Custom Connect on the last day of the 


year, which most of us refer to as New Year’s Eve (December 31, 2017 also happened to be a 


Sunday).  


GTT did not provide any financials for Custom Connect. However, after extensive digging 


through European filings, we found Custom Connect’s 2015 - 2017 financials in a filing from its 


domicile country, the Netherlands. This filing suggests that GTT paid 1.6x revenue for Custom 


Connect – which, if true, is noticeably higher than management’s guidance of 0.8x to 1.2x for 


these smaller acquisitions. We estimate that GTT paid 110.0x EBITDA for Custom Connect – 


approximately 2,100% above management’s guidance of 5.0x. It would take an unbelievable 


amount of synergies to make this EBITDA multiple “deleveraging” for GTT. You can see 


Custom Connect’s deteriorating financials in its 2015 – 2017 income statements, which (unlike 


GTT) we have provided in Appendix C of this report.  


We gave GTT the benefit of the doubt and calculated organic growth using $0 for Custom 


Connect’s revenue contribution to Q4 2017, although Custom Connect’s December 2017 billing 


could theoretically have been deferred until December 31 as part of the negotiations for this 


transaction. We found that GTT’s sequential organic revenue growth rate was -0.5%, as opposed 


to the 23.0% sequential revenue growth rate reported by GTT. If GTT had recognized Custom 


Connect’s December 2017 revenue, GTT’s sequential organic growth rate would have been         


-1.1% in Q4 2017. 


GTT does disclose and even at times boasts about its sequential revenue growth. With no 


acquisitions or asset purchases in Q1 2019 to create the appearance of growth, GTT reported 


revenue of $450.2 million, a decrease of -$4.6 million, or -1.0% from the previous quarter. This 


was GTT’s first sequential revenue decline since Q1 2015, another indication to us that this is a 


broken rollup story. GTT’s stock fell more than 35% in the 5 trading days following its earnings 


report. GTT’s 2024 senior unsecured notes lost more than 9 cents on the dollar during that same 


5-day period – sending the yield-to-maturity (“YTM”) to near 12% from around 9% prior to Q1 


2019 earnings.

Net Installations – A Measure of Organic Growth 


Net installations (“net installs”) is the only organic growth metric we have seen GTT report. The 


company only reports this figure in its proxy statements because it is used for a portion of GTT’s 


cash-based executive compensation plans. In 2017, GTT reported net installations of $6.1 


million.  





However, we calculated net installs of -$11.7 million for GTT in 2017 – leaving a $17.8 million 


delta between GTT’s reported number and our calculation. The table below shows our 


calculations for GTT’s net installs: 





Net installations (USD, millions) 2017 2018 2019 


Q1 (1.4) 3.7 (4.6) 


Q2 (6.3) (9.5) - 


Q3 (2.7) (16.5) - 


Q4 (1.3) (4.0) - 


Annual net installations (11.7) (26.3) (18.3) 


GTT reported net installations 6.1 N/A N/A 


Delta (17.8) - - 





We believe the delta shown above is the result of GTT’s inclusion of approximately $17.8 


million of revenue from “asset purchases” (i.e., inorganic growth) in its reported net installations 


– a metric that GTT itself states is “a good measure of organic growth.”4 








                                                           
4 You can see the calculations behind the numbers presented above in Appendix A of this report.
Page 8 of 33 
 


In 2018, GTT set, and missed, a negative target of -$1.4 million for net installations. Unlike the 


2017 proxy, GTT elected not to disclose its actual net installations performance for 2018, which 


totaled -$26.3 million according to our calculations. It appears to us that the difference between 


2017 and 2018 was the huge acquisition of Interoute and the absence of “asset purchases” in 


2018. 





GTT’s General Counsel and Executive Vice President Chris McKee made the following 


statement about rep productivity post-Interoute during the Q&A session at Cowen & Company’s 


Technology, Media and Telecom Conference, just after he and CFO Mike Sicoli were caught off 


guard by the sudden announcement that the Interoute deal had closed: 


“Yeah. One of the frustrating-but-sort-of-good news, good news, bad news aspect for us 


is our rep productivity, the amount of the amount of new MRR that reps have sold has 


actually been quite good. So, as we've scaled up the sales force, that's one of the things 


that you worry about will just fall off a cliff.” 


We think that “fall off a cliff” is the perfect way to describe GTT’s sales rep productivity in the 


quarters that followed – our calculations show that GTT posted net installations of -$9.5 million, 


-$16.5 million and -$4.0 million in Q2, Q3 and Q4 2018, respectively. At least one of GTT’s 


executives foresaw the devastating effect that the Interoute acquisition would have on the 


company’s organic growth – unfortunately for GTT’s investors, he waited until it was too late to 


disclose this opinion publicly. 


“Rep productivity” and “churn” are the two components that make up organic growth for GTT. 


Creating further financial opacity, GTT does not disclose its rep productivity number to investors 


– despite CEO Rick Calder’s statement on GTT’s Q3 2017 earnings call that,  


“We see a lot of opportunity to continue to grow the scope and scale of the organization 


and maintain productivity rates which we think are industry leading in some respects.”  


If GTT’s rep productivity is truly “industry leading” why wouldn’t they disclose it? GTT’s rep 


productivity may truly be industry leading “in some respects,” but apparently not in the right 


direction, at net installations of  -$26.3 million in 2018.
Page 9 of 33 
 


As part of our due diligence, we spoke to a former GTT Regional VP. When asked about GTT’s 


churn rate. He said that,  


“They are having a big problem there, they can’t outsell their churn, and that was a 


problem a year and half ago and they can’t provision right now to get things installed.”  


His commentary on customer service was even more negative. In describing management’s 


approach to attempting to reduce churn, he said,  


“If you’re coming up on a contract, they are holding a gun to the head of their customer, 


saying ‘look, you are either going to re-up with us and you will get a 10% or a 5% 


discount on your contract or we are going to automatically increase your rates by 30%, I 


don't care who you are.’ So, salespeople and service people are going in and they are 


holding the gun to the client’s head and it's ostracizing their customers like crazy and as 


a result, they are losing revenue and they are losing trust with customers and it’s a really 


big issue.”  


Judging by the comments above as well as management’s 70% markdown to the carrying value 


of Interoute’s customer lists just months after the acquisition, it is clear to us that GTT’s sales 


reps are fighting an uphill battle for organic growth. Interoute doubled the size of GTT 


overnight, meaning that a 70% churn of Interoute’s customer lists implies a 35% churn of GTT’s 


entire customer base. We believe that without growth from additional acquisitions (inorganic 


growth), even flat sequential revenue is unlikely for GTT going forward. 


GTT’s management has stated many times that the company needs to add 50 to 100 additional 


productive sales reps to achieve mid-single-digit organic growth. The problem is that finding, 


hiring, training and retaining 50 to 100 sales reps to productively sell telecommunications 


services will be both difficult and expensive.  


One of GTT’s largest competitors had this to say about the challenges of managing a salesforce 


in their industry:  


“[The hardest part of this business] is, by far and away, sales. It’s the ability to hire a 


sales force, train them, retain them, motivate them, keep them focused, promote them, 


give them a career path. It’s an awful job, it’s an outbound, tele-sales model, where 


you’re making 100 cold calls per day to people that don’t want to talk to you. And that’s 


a really hard thing to do.” 


Since the acquisition of Interoute, GTT’s underlying business has continuously deteriorated. 


GTT does not generate organic growth and without organic growth, we believe GTT will be 


unable to cover its $200+ million of annual interest expense in 2019, much less fund any 


acquisitions that are large enough to move the needle for GTT at its current scale.

2. Math is a Science; Accounting is an Art Form – Tools for Financial Engineering 


GTT adjusted the purchase price allocation (“PPA”) and stretched the useful lives/amortization 


periods of the assets acquired from Interoute in order to hide its abysmal financial results from 


investors. These adjustments inflated GTT’s operating profit and net income by $78.7 million in 


2018 and an increase of $37.9 million in Q1 2019 – which equates to an increase of more than 


$150 million on an annualized basis for 2019.

GTT’s aggressive accounting has two key components which, when combined, create the 


operating expense reductions shown above – depreciation/amortization period extensions and 


post-close purchase price allocation (“PPA”) adjustments.  





Depreciation and Amortization Period Extensions 





GTT has extended the amortization period of its “customer lists” intangible asset in each of the 


past three years. In GTT’s 2016 10-K, it lists the amortization period of customer lists as 3 to 7 


years. In the 2017 10-K, GTT extended this amortization period to 3 to 10 years. In the 2018 10-


K, GTT listed the amortization period as 3 to 20 years despite stating an amortization period for 


Interoute’s customer lists of only 8 to 10 years just 8 months earlier.
Page 11 of 33 
 


GTT provided no explanation for these extensions in its filings. We believe that the company 


should have been required to provide investors an explanation for these extensions, as customer 


lists make up a material 10.2% portion of GTT’s total assets.  





Amortization Period of Intangibles 2015 2016 2017 2018 


Customer Lists  3-7 years   3-7 years   3-10 years   3-20 years

Trade Name  3 years   3 years   3 years   1-3 years  





The effect of these adjustments is massive, as shown in the chart below: 








GTT also extended the useful lives (or “depreciation periods”) of its PP&E in 2017 and 2018. In 


2017, GTT extended the depreciation period for its “network equipment” from “5 years” to “3 to 


15 years” without explanation. In 2018, GTT extended the depreciation period of its “fiber optic 


cable” from “20 years” to “20 to 40 years” again with no explanation. This extension had a 


material effect on GTT’s depreciation expense – especially considering that most of Interoute’s 


PP&E is made up of fiber optic cable.

Once again, the effect of these adjustments is massive, as shown in the chart below:  








As part of our due diligence, we asked one of GTT’s largest competitors about this depreciation 


period. He told us that, while fiber can last 40 years: 





“No one else in the industry uses a 40-year depreciation. The industry standard for pretty 


much everyone, from AT&T to Verizon to CenturyLink to Cogent is generally 20 years. 


Sometimes 15 but most cases 20.” 





We believe GTT extended the depreciation period of its fiber assets and continued to extend the 


amortization period for its acquired customer lists in 2018 in order to reduce its depreciation and 


amortization expense.  











Purchase Price Allocation Adjustments  





GTT was already extremely aggressive in its initial valuations of Interoute’s assets.  





Interoute showed $522 million in PP&E on its Q1 2018 balance sheet. Approximately two 


months later, when GTT performed its initial fair value assessment of these same assets, GTT 


marked up the value of Interoute’s PP&E by nearly 100%, to $1.014 billion. GTT also assigned 


an initial carrying value of $580 million to Interoute’s customer lists – which appear on GTT’s 


balance sheet as an intangible asset.

Page 13 of 33 
 





The PPA in GTT’s March 1, 2019 10-K is significantly different than the PPA provided by GTT 


just under 8 months earlier. Here, GTT marked up the carrying value of Interoute’s PP&E by 


another $422 million, bringing the total carrying value of Interoute’s PP&E to $1.436 billion. 


This represents a total markup of $914 million, or 175%, from the carrying value of PP&E on 


Interoute’s Q1 2018 balance sheet.  





Adjustments to the PPA post-acquisition aren’t uncommon and are allowed for up to 12 months 


post-close under ASC 805-10. However, these are enormous adjustments. We fail to understand 


how a 175% markup to PP&E could possibly have been made in good faith by GTT. This is fiber 


in the ground we are talking about here, not gold. At the same time, GTT marked down the 


carrying value of the customer lists acquired from Interoute by -$408.5 million, or -70.4%, to 


$171.5 million from GTT’s initial fair value assessment of $580 million, just 8 months earlier. In 


fact, GTT adjusted the value of every single line item from the original PPA. Incredibly, GTT 


revalued 6 of the 9 ‘asset’ line items by 40% or more.

Net assets acquired 2,239.3 2,239.3 0.0% 





These adjustments had two significant effects on GTT’s financial results:  





First, since GTT can depreciate PP&E over a period as long as 40 years, it was in GTT’s interest 


to shift as much of the intangible asset value to PP&E as possible, since intangibles can only be 


amortized over a period as long as 20 years. Simple math shows that $400 million of intangibles, 


amortized over 20 years will result in annual amortization expense of $20 million. That same 


$400 million, now classified as PP&E, can instead be depreciated over 40 years – resulting in 


annual depreciation expense of only $10 million. This equates to a 50% decrease in annual 


depreciation and amortization expense for GTT. 



https://www.iasplus.com/en-us/standards/fasb/broad-transactions/asc805
Page 14 of 33 
 





Second, by marking down the value assigned to Interoute’s customer lists by 70%, we are asked 


to believe that GTT either massively overvalued Interoute’s customer lists, which means that the 


$1.1 billion that GTT already assigned to goodwill would have been $1.5 billion of the $2.2 


billion total purchase price. Or, GTT churned 70% of Interoute’s clients within months of the 


acquisition, which is effectively 35% of GTT’s entire customer base. However, we actually 


believe GTT wrote down $408.5 million of its intangible assets on the PPA to avoid taking an 


impairment charge.  





GTT acquired three large, declining businesses in the last two years, all three of which 


experienced continued churn post-acquisition. This is reflected in our organic growth 


calculations as well as acknowledged by management on earnings calls. As a result, we believe 


that GTT was facing a multi-hundred-million-dollar impairment charge which would have had a 


significant negative impact on its already enormous net loss of $243 million in 2018. By marking 


down the value of Interoute’s customer lists post-close, GTT effectively impaired a large portion 


of all its intangible assets while also avoiding the scrutiny that comes with an impairment charge.  














3. Free Cash Flow and Debt Service 
 


We have already established that GTT does not grow organically. GTT relies on debt funded 


acquisitions to keep its growth story alive. The problem is that GTT does not generate enough 


cash to cover its nearly $200 million in annual interest expense, much less fund further 


acquisitions.  





GTT directs investors and analysts attention to non-GAAP metrics such as adjusted free cash 


flow, which excludes severance, restructuring and other exit costs, and transaction and 


integration costs from its actual free cash flow. GTT attempts to justify its use of this metric with 


the following statement: 





“We believe that the presentation of Adjusted Free Cash Flow is relevant and useful to 


investors because it provides a measure of cash available to pay the principal on our 


debt and pursue acquisitions of businesses or other strategic investments or uses of 


capital.”5 





This is simply not true. This cash would only be available to pay principal on debt and pursue 


further acquisitions in an imaginary world where this cash had not already been spent on 


severance, restructuring and other exit costs as well as transaction and integration costs, which 


left them with only $4.3 million of real free cash flow in 2018 – enough to pay down a whopping 


0.13% of the principal on GTT’s debt.  








                                                           
5 GTT Q1 2019 SEC Form 10-Q, p. 40
Page 15 of 33 
 


In reality, GTT generated negative free cash flow of -$16 million in Q1 2019 and only $4.3 


million in all of 2018. The fact of the matter is that, following the acquisition of Interoute, which 


deviated significantly from GTT’s “capex-light” strategy, it is mathematically impossible for 


GTT to generate meaningful free cash flow without significantly improving its cash conversion 


rate.  





GTT’s trailing-twelve-month (“TTM”) cash conversion rate is only 5.1% - significantly worse 


than most of its peers, whose weighted average cash conversion rate is 21.5%.

Unisys (UIS) 53.7 2,812.4 1.9% 


Weighted Average   21.5% 











With management’s guidance for capex to remain at 7% of revenue and a cash conversation rate 


of only 5.1%, GTT cannot generate real positive free cash flow. Free cash flow is defined as 


operating cash flow (“OCF”) less capex. If OCF is only 5.1% of revenue (and declining), while 


capex remains at 7% of revenue, it is mathematically impossible for GTT to generate positive 


free cash flow.  





GTT’s abysmal cash conversion rate is a side effect of its aggressive accounting practices. 


Creative accounting can synthetically grow the top line for a few quarters. However, it is 


impossible for the accounting department to generate cash flow. GTT’s OCF/Sales ratio (cash 


conversion rate) has been declining since Q3 2017, indicating that an increasing amount of 


GTT’s reported growth has come from the accounting department.
Page 16 of 33 
 





4. Pro Forma Financials and Unrealized Synergies 


Pro forma financials and expected synergies are paramount for GTT, whose maximum leverage 


ratio covenant is based on pro forma adjusted EBITDA plus expected synergies. This affords 


GTT an great deal amount of flexibility when calculating its leverage ratio. GTT’s net debt to 


EBITDA is approximately 10.9x using standard EBITDA, or approximately 7.8x using GTT’s 


definition of adjusted EBITDA. Both of these would violate GTT’s maximum leverage covenant 


of 6.5x, which drops to 6.25x on the last day of Q3 2019. Somehow, GTT was able to customize 


a leverage ratio of only 5.0x at the end of Q1 2019. We say somehow because this leverage 


calculation is only presented in GTT’s “Private Lender Presentation,” which is not available for 


GTT’s shareholders to review. 


GTT used to present these pro forma financials in its investor presentations as well – until Q4 


2018, when GTT removed the pro forma revenue and adjusted EBITDA slides from its investor 


presentation as the numbers continued to deteriorate.  


Before the acquisition of Interoute in Q2 2018, GTT’s quarterly investor presentation featured a 


slide presenting GTT’s pro forma revenue and pro forma adjusted EBITDA numbers (without 


expected synergies), along with the calculations for both. Below is an example from Q1 2018:

The reporting of GTT’s pro forma numbers became more creative after the Interoute deal closed 


in Q2 2018. Note that in addition to Interoute, GTT now also includes five other acquisitions for 


“synergies” in Q2 2018: 





Source: GTT Q2 2018 Investor Presentation, slide 18
Page 18 of 33 
 


In Q3 2018, GTT again changes its presentation of pro forma adjusted EBITDA. GTT now 


includes synergies from all acquisitions, as well as pre-close reported adjusted EBITDA for 


Custom Connect and ACI. Despite all of these additions, pro forma adjusted EBITDA still 


declined from $576.5 million to $568 million between Q2 and Q3 2018. As if that’s not bad 


enough, $568 is an incorrect number – it’s actually $567. It appears that GTT thinks that 2+1 = 4 











Source: GTT Q3 2018 Investor Presentation, slide 17 





In Q4 2018, GTT removed the pro forma adjusted EBITDA slide altogether. Apparently, 


even with “pre-close reported adjusted EBITDA” from its Q4 2018 acquisition of Access Point, 


GTT still could not mask its decline. We view this as yet another example of GTT’s deliberate 


efforts to hide its deteriorating financial condition from its investors. 





5. Executive Compensation – Incentivizing Value Destruction:  


GTT’s “performance-based” executive compensation plans are based on revenue growth, 


“adjusted EBITDA” and “adjusted unlevered free cash flow,” which was added to the new plan 


that GTT implemented in November 2018. These metrics incentivize large, expensive 


acquisitions which, in our opinion, are destroying shareholder value.  


Despite posting record net losses in 2017 and 2018, GTT’s executives received record 


compensation of $37 million in the last two years.6

2+1 = 4?
Page 19 of 33 
 


GTT’s definition of “adjusted” in adjusted EBITDA and adjusted unlevered free cash flow 


metrics is completely ridiculous, in our opinion. For GTT, “adjusted” means “excluding 


severance and other exit costs, transaction and integration costs and share-based compensation 


expense.” The “unlevered” in adjusted unlevered free cash flow means that it also excludes 


interest expense, which will cost GTT more than $200 million in 2019. 


All of these adjustments are significant recurring costs for GTT, making these grossly misguided 


metrics for determining executive compensation. GTT’s focus on top-line metrics allow 


management to reap the rewards of inorganic growth while ignoring the massive risks that come 


with it – the risks are pushed onto shareholders. 


The charts below display the stark divergence between GTT’s financial performance and the

GTT’s executives have taken home $70.9 million in total compensation since 2010, while 


generating a cumulative net loss of nearly $340 million. We could not find a single measure that 


justifies GTT’s level of executive compensation given the company’s financial condition. 


This seemingly inverse relationship between profitability and performance-based compensation 


begs the question: what is performance to GTT?  


The answer appears to be very simple to us: grow the top line at any and all costs – collect a 


bonus.

Conclusion 


We couldn’t think of a better way to conclude this report than with the following comment from 


the CEO of one of GTT’s top competitors. When we asked the question, “do you think GTT will 


be around in 5 years, or will other competitors with that type of framework potentially be 


interested in acquiring them?” he said the following: 


“So, if GTT continues to do acquisitions and the capital markets remain open, they'll be 


fine. When the music stops and they actually perform, the value will collapse. The real 


value of GTT is below the face value of the equity. What my experience has told me is 


rarely do companies trade that level. So, chances are, it will not be an actionable 


acquisition. I think they will just turn into what I would call a zombie. So just kind of sit 


there, probably have a single-digit stock price. No real equity value, negative growth. 


And they’ll just kind of bumble along. I mean, the markets do tolerate that type of 


business. But when the capital markets do become discerning, then at that point, maybe a 


distressed situation like a Frontier or a Windstream. And there may be an opportunity 


there. But usually there's such a convoluted capital structure that outside of bankruptcy, 


there's no way to actually action a deal.” 


Needless to say, we agree – if GTT cannot find a way to grow organically, the future looks 


bleak. We consider one or more of the following scenarios to be likely: 


• Dilutive equity raises 


• Refinancing of debt on onerous terms  


• Reversal of the rollup strategy to an asset sale strategy 


• Bankruptcy (Chapter 11 restructuring)

Appendix D – The Most Awkward Conference Call Transcript We’ve Ever Seen 





To provide some context, CFO Mike Sicoli is in the middle of talking about the success of 


GTT’s “capex-light” strategy and how a “really strong strategic fit” is key to GTT’s M&A 


targets, when he is apparently informed in real-time that the Interoute deal has closed. Interoute 


is anything but “capex-light.” Interoute owns a huge fiber optic cable network in Europe, 


employing an entirely different strategy than GTT. It is incredible to us that the CFO could have 


possibly been unaware that a $2.23 billion acquisition, which more than doubled the size of the 


Company, was set to close that day.
