Summary: Genprex, Inc (GNPX)
Genprex was founded by a team that led Introgen, one of the more notable biotech


catastrophes that declared bankruptcy amidst allegations of repeatedly misleading


investors.


Genprex’s product candidate is based on IP that was abandoned in Introgen’s bankruptcy


because it “provide[d] no value to the debtors and [was] of no interest to the potential


purchasers”.


The product candidate looks to already be in trouble. The company’s Phase II trial has


been suspended since April 2016.


Genprex’s underwriter, Network 1 Financial, has led or participated in the underwritings


of recent disasters such as LongFin, Long Blockchain, Adomani, and CIFS among others.


Texas-based Genprex uses a small Boca Raton, Florida-based auditor and has been


heavily promoted on penny stock websites and newsletters. We believe Genprex is a zero


in the making.

We Believe Genprex Is A Disaster In The
Making

Genprex (GNPX (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GNPX)) is a newly-listed company with only


4 full-time employees


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000156459018008342/gnpx-


10k_20171231.htm) that describes itself as


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000118518517001576/genprex-s1.htm) “a


clinical stage gene therapy company developing a new approach to treating cancer.”


Despite the supposed “new approach” to cancer treatment, we learned that the foundation of


Genprex’s key product candidate largely consists of intellectual property that was legally


abandoned during the 2009 bankruptcy of Introgen, the founder’s previous failed public


company. Introgen in turn had access to the intellectual property since as early as 2001 and


was unable to commercialize or even meaningfully advance its development in that period.


By way of background, Introgen managed to raise over $700 million in investment


(https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-politics/2010/10/04/20101003-Perry-says-innovator-


who-s-also-3955) over its history but ultimately failed spectacularly and declared bankruptcy


amidst accusations that it had repeatedly misled investors.


After assuming control of some of Introgen’s discarded intellectual property, the �edgling


Genprex was then breathed life through a controversial $4.5 million grant facilitated by former


Texas Governor Rick Perry. The grant sparked questions of pay to play


(https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-politics/2010/10/03/perry_s-tech-fund-aided-�rms-


with-ties-to-his-donors) given that the founder of Genprex was a key Perry donor and the two


were hunting pals (https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-politics/2010/10/04/20101003-


Perry-says-innovator-who-s-also-3955) along with other interrelated business and personal


dealings (https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-politics/2010/10/04/20101003-Perry-says-


innovator-who-s-also-3955).


With some early capital courtesy of the citizens of Texas, Genprex eventually lurched toward a


public o�ering late last year. The company turned to Network 1 Financial, an underwriter who


has recently led or participated in the o�erings


(https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/o�ering-history.aspx?


expert=network+1+�nancial+securities%2C+inc.) of the following recent debacles:


LongFin Corp. (OTCPK:LFIN (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LFIN)) went public in


mid-December 2017 and was halted just months later when regulators stepped in


(http://fortune.com/2018/04/06/long�n-stock-t12-halt-bitcoin-price-buy/) to “prevent


more than $27 million in alleged illicit trading pro�ts from being transferred out of the


country.” LongFin is still halted as of this writing. Network 1 led the IPO

The Genprex IPO faltered out of the gate. The company originally intended

4M+Share+IPO+at+%245Sh/13389909.html) to price 2.5 million to 4.5 million shares in


November 2017, which would have garnered gross proceeds of $12.5 million to $22.5 million.


Ultimately, the March 2018 IPO (https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/genprex-inc-

The cash pulled in from the IPO looked woefully insu�cient to support the company’s


operations. The company’s auditor (https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?

So where did the company invest its small capital base? At least some of it went to pay stock


promoters. Just prior to the IPO the company signed a $255,000 agreement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000119312518101595/d486549dex1022.ht


m) with a stock promoter who then in turn paid penny stock newsletter “AwesomeStocks.com


(https://www.awesomestocks.com/)” and at least one other publication


(https://cna�nance.com/genprex-stock-may-o�er-signi�cant-growth-opportunity/18965).


The low �oat stock seemed to respond favorably. It has ripped almost 200% higher since its IPO


on minimal other news (http://ir.genprex.com/news-and-events/news-releases).


On the clinical side, the company’s Phase II trial has been on hold for over 2 years (since April


2016) as it seeks to “collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek FDA


guidance” on its next steps. (Pg. 87


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000119312517342616/d486549d424b3.ht


m).)


Aside from the above, other questions perplex us: Why has this Austin, Texas-based company


chosen to use a small auditor (https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?


FirmID=EBA7D4267C51F4B6CAB15A884A53FB32) based out of Boca Raton, Florida? Why did


this clinical stage company spend over 10x more on general and administrative expenses than


on actual R&D as of the latest annual report?


All told we believe Genprex is a zero in the making. The company just announced


(http://ir.genprex.com/news-releases/news-release-details/genprex-announces-10-million-


private-placement) a $10 million private placement o�ering that we anticipate will be the �rst


of many future o�erings. Overall we think the company will be the latest in a slew of recent


Nasdaq-listed embarrassments and believe it will end in disaster for investors. In the interim,


we expect it to be a bumpy ride.

Spectacular Introgen Failure

Genprex looks to be the next act of a management team mired in historical controversy and


failure. David Nance founded the company (under a predecessor name


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/MqtqzjEF2h4wQW)) in 2009 one month before resigning as


CEO of Introgen Therapeutics, a scandal-riddled cancer gene therapy company that ultimately


declared bankruptcy. Following Introgen’s bankruptcy, noted biotech journalist Adam


Feuerstein penned the following eulogy


(https://www.thestreet.com/story/13096791/1/bankrupt-introgen-seeks-reincarnation-ipo-in-


biotech-bubble.html):


In the sordid annals of biotech bamboozlement, Introgen Therapeutics stood apart.


Throughout the mid 2000s, Introgen repeatedly misled investors


(http://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10426187.html) about the data generated in


clinical trials of its cancer gene therapy Advexin


(http://www.thestreet.com/story/10338486/1/introgens-data-mining-misleads.html).


Company executives made false promises to investors


(http://www.thestreet.com/story/10342959/1/introgens-promise.html) about Advexin’s


path to FDA approval.


Introgen kept the Advexin charade alive until 2008 when the FDA slammed the door


shut, refusing to even review (http://www.thestreet.com/story/10435392/1/introgen-


critically-hurt-by-fda-advexin-snub.html) the drug’s approval application.”


Introgen’s stock price plummeted, and shareholders lost everything. In 2009, Introgen


dissolved as a bankrupt biotech failure


(http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/12/03/introgen-bankruptcy-


idINN0343564920081203).


Aside from Nance (who later passed away in 2016) other key individuals were pulled out of


Introgen’s ashes, dusted o�, and returned to service at Genprex. In particular:


Rodney Varner, Chairman and CEO of Genprex was Introgen’s general counsel and


corporate secretary (Pg. 2) (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/92sbtrQLLyn5vh). As an


aside, we typically prefer clinical-stage biotech companies to be led by scientists rather


than lawyers, and this is doubly more so when the lawyer in question was general counsel


to a company accused of the wrongdoing cited above.


Dr. Jack Roth, Chairman of Genprex’s Scienti�c and Medical Advisory Board was


previously Chairman of Introgen’s Scienti�c Advisory Board (Introgen 10-K pg. 29) Privacy  - Terms

htm). A separate article (https://www.thestreet.com/print/story/10426187.html) by Adam


Feuerstein on Introgen noted that the company’s lead doctors (who were themselves led


by Dr. Roth) “stated emphatically that [the lead drug candidate] works and that the drug


will be approved.” As described above, the doctors turned out to be heroically wrong as


the FDA took the rare step of refusing to even review the drug’s application. Dr. Roth has


a key role relating to Genprex given that he serves as the chief of thoractic molecular


oncology (https://faculty.mdanderson.org/pro�les/jack_roth.html) at the University of


Texas’s M.D. Anderson cancer center. The center is running Genprex’s trials and plays a


pivotal research role for the company. The relationship with M.D. Anderson is so


important that it is cited as a key risk factor in the company’s �nancials (Pg. 34


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000119312518101608/d486549d424

Overall we do not think the track record of this combined research and business team bodes


well for Genprex’s shareholders.


Genprex’s Core IP Is Almost 17 Years Old And
Had Been Legally Abandoned Because It
Provided “No Value” To Its Holders And Was Of
“No Interest” To Prospective Purchasers


The company’s initial proposed product is called Oncoprex, a gene therapy designed to


interrupt cancer cell signaling in order to kill the cells. Per the recent 10-K, Oncoprex is the


company’s R&D pipeline thus far (Pg. 5

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The foundation of Oncoprex is a gene called TUSC2, which was mentioned 175 times in the


company’s S-1 registration statement (https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/�ling.ashx?


�lingid=12274595). Per the S-1:


Oncoprex consists of a TUSC2 gene encapsulated in a positively charged nanovesicle


made from lipid molecules with a positive electrical charge. (Pg. 3


(https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/�ling.ashx?�lingid=12274595))


While Genprex describes itself as searching for a “new approach” to treating cancer, we found


that Introgen originally had the licensing rights to TUSC2 almost 17 years ago:


The TUSC2 technologies were added by Amendment No. 3 to the MD Anderson License


Agreement dated October 4, 2001. Under the MD Anderson License Agreement, we


have rights to patents covering use of various genes, including the TUSC2 gene, for


treatment of cancer, as well as know-how and related intellectual property. (Pg. 96


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000119312517342616/d486549d


424b3.htm))


We can’t help but wonder what the value of TUSC2 could be given that the previous owner


(under the guidance of overlapping leadership) was unable to commercialize or even


meaningfully advance the IP toward commercialization despite having control of it for almost 8


years.


Furthermore, despite being core to Genprex’s value proposition we learned that the intellectual


property for TUSC2 had been legally abandoned in Introgen’s bankruptcy. A May 20  2009


bankruptcy docket �ling (https://www.slideshare.net/secret/ybZeoDkv5X6wcb) shows that


Introgen (i.e. the ‘Debtors’) ultimately abandoned certain patents because there was no interest


among prospective purchasers, they provided no value to the debtors, and they were draining


money from the estate due to maintenance fees:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
To further demonstrate this, another bankruptcy �ling included an email between Introgen and


a Varner-controlled entity called IRI that speci�cally con�rmed that IRI had assumed control of


the TUSC2 intellectual property as a result of the abandonment [Note: TUSC2 was formerly


known as FUS1 (Pg. 2 (https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/�ling.ashx?�lingid=12274595))]:


Thus, ISI assumed control of some of the abandoned property that was of “no value” to the


Introgen estate and assigned it to Genprex, which summarily used it as the foundation for the


company’s key product candidate.


We provide more detail below on recent signs of trouble relating to Genprex’s attempts to


commercialize this IP.

Genprex Was Breathed Life Through A Dubious
Grant Involving Former Texas Governor Rick
Perry


One might wonder – who would fund such a venture? One that largely consisted of abandoned


intellectual property, founded by a failed biotech CEO accused of misleading investors, and all


right in the midst of that very executive’s latest contentious and controversial


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/jZwgutC8Z4UnY8) bankruptcy?


The answer seems to be Texas Governor Rick Perry. Or more precisely, Governor Rick Perry on


behalf of the people of Texas.


Following Introgen’s bankruptcy, its former CEO David Nance seemingly wasted no time in


working with political connections to help fuel his new Genprex endeavor. During 2009, while


Introgen was still navigating its way through the bankruptcy process, Nance submitted an


application to the Texan “Emerging Technology Fund


(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Emerging_Technology_Fund).” The fund was a state-


backed investment vehicle created at the urging of governor Rick Perry with a stated purpose


of promoting R&D and the development of new technologies in Texas.


The fund eventually came under intense scrutiny due to the very circumstances around its $4.5


million grant to Genprex. Per the Wall Street Journal


(https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702304760604576428262897285614):


In 2009, when Mr. Nance submitted his application for a $4.5 million Emerging


Technology Fund grant for Convergen [later renamed Genprex], he and his partners


had invested only $1,000 of their own money into their new company, according to


documentation prepared by the governor’s o�ce in February 2010. But over the


years, Mr. Nance managed to invest a lot more than $1,000 in Mr. Perry. Texas Ethics


Commission records show that Mr. Nance donated $75,000 to Mr. Perry’s campaigns


between 2001 and 2006.


The regional application was summarily rejected. But alas:

In 2010, Perry and legislative leaders gave Convergen LifeSciences the $4.5 million


grant after a regional screening committee rejected the company’s application. Nance


put o� a second review panel before a statewide advisory panel to the Emerging


Technology Fund, which included an Introgen alum, �nally recommended Convergen’s


application to the governor.

In 2010, the Dallas Morning News (https://www.dallasnews.com/news/local-


politics/2010/10/04/20101003-Perry-says-innovator-who-s-also-3955) published a long-form


investigative piece on the background of Nance and his interrelated dealings with Perry. It is an


illuminating read and the details are still relevant today. For example, the piece and related


articles highlight that a former Perry aide named Ryan Confer previously served as the #2 man


(https://www.texasobserver.org/3044-political-intelligence-hungry-for-justice/) at the Emerging


Technology Fund which had later granted Genprex the $4.5 million.


Today, Ryan Confer serves as Genprex’s CFO.


Who Would Take This Company Public?


With some cash and abandoned IP in hand the company advanced toward a public o�ering late


last year. Meanwhile, research partner MD Anderson had completed phase I trials for the


company’s product candidate, although its phase II trial had already been suspended for about


a year by that point. The company nonetheless decided to pursue a public o�ering and


selected Network 1 Financial Services as its sole underwriter.


It was an interesting choice. Around that same time, a June 2017 exposé


(https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-�nra-brokers/) by Reuters focused on


broker-dealers that employ advisors with histories of misconduct. The exposé speci�cally


named Network 1 and showed that a whopping 44.6% of Network 1’s brokers had been �agged


by FINRA for incidents such as regulatory sanctions, civil judgments, personal bankruptcies or


broker terminations after allegations of misconduct. FINRA is such an important organization


as it keeps people safe from pretenders who have the power to send them into �nancial ruin

like this. It’s a fantastic career option for those who want to protect vulnerable people, and


thanks to resources like the mta 98-364 practice test (https://www.certlibrary.com/info/98-364),


the path is easier than ever to enter on to.


Network 1’s BrokerCheck report (https://brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/summary/13577) discloses


14 regulatory events, including a settlement following allegations


(https://�les.brokercheck.�nra.org/�rm/�rm_13577.pdf) that the �rm:


Committed fraud in the o�er and sales of securities by making untrue statements of


material fact and/or omitting to state material facts, and engaged in acts, practices,


and courses of business, which operated as a fraud or deceit upon the persons who


purchased such securities.


As noted in our introduction, Network 1 has recently led the o�erings of multiple publicly listed


tragedies. We encourage readers to explore the remainder of Network 1’s underwriting list


(https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/o�ering-history.aspx?

Genprex’s Initial Product Candidate Already
Looks To Be In Trouble


We are seeing signs that the company’s attempt to advance its initial product may already be


failing:


In April 2016, we suspended enrollment of new patients in the Phase II Combination


Trial to collect additional trial data and have it analyzed in order to seek FDA


guidance as to whether the protocol for this clinical trial could be modi�ed to expand


enrollment and also to divide the patients into cohorts with a view toward seeking


accelerated approval in one or more of these cohort populations. (Prospectus Pg. 87

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
While our primary concern from the above quote is the suspension of the company’s Phase II


trial, we also want to draw attention to the last part. The company is looking to subdivide its


existing patient population into cohorts to see if any of those cohorts can be brought toward


“accelerated approval.”


Going again back to the Introgen days, Adam Feuerstein provided


(https://www.thestreet.com/story/10338486/1/introgens-data-mining-misleads.html) analysis


(https://www.thestreet.com/story/10426187/1/introgens-advexin-doesnt-work-period.html)


showing that the company’s drug candidate did not appear to work (which turned out to be


correct) and that the company seemed to be cherry-picking a subset of patients in order to


claim that the product was working. He noted that the company provided a range of excuses


for this cherry-picking, none of which passed the smell test.


With this backdrop, we can’t help but wonder whether the same scenario is starting to unfold


at Genprex, given the above.


Lastly, at risk of belaboring the point, the future direction of Genprex’s recent trial


(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01455389?term=genprex&phase=1&rank=1) strikes us


fraught with uncertainty:


…If we reach an agreement with the FDA regarding expanded patient enrollment and


de�ned patient cohorts, we plan to amend the trial protocol accordingly and proceed


with the amended protocol at MD Anderson and several additional clinical trial sites.


(Pg. 87


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000119312517342616/d486549d


424b3.htm))


The above strikes us as a rather big “if.”


Other Concerns


Promotional Campaigns. As noted above, Genprex has spent at least $255,000 on stock


promotion. The IPO only generated net proceeds of about $5 million suggesting the


promotional campaigns represent a meaningful amount of cash. We found campaigns at

signi�cant-growth-opportunity/18965), and penny stock email newsletter Awesomestocks.com


(http://awesomestocks.com/).


Auditor. Another oddity we noticed is that Genprex, an Austin, Texas-based �rm, has chosen


to use a small auditor based out of Boca Raton, Florida. This strikes us as bizarre. Typically


companies choose auditors with a strong local presence in order to make it easier to


communicate.


G&A expenses are over 10x R&D expenses. Given that Genprex is a clinical stage company,


one might expect a heavy bias toward R&D investment. Instead, the 2017 10-K (Pg. 77


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000156459018008342/gnpx-


10k_20171231.htm)) shows R&D expenses of only about $300,000 versus general and


administrative expenses of over $3 million. Recall that Genprex had only 4 full-time employees


and 1 part-time employee as of the recent annual report. (For a review of all the components of


G&A and R&D see pg 79-80


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1595248/000156459018008342/gnpx-


10k_20171231.htm).)


Conclusion


We don’t think Genprex should have been brought public in the �rst place. Our belief is that


the company is a long-term zero. That being said, given the tiny �oat, we think Genprex is also


a dangerous short and thus we have only a small position that we are managing carefully. As


LongFin’s meteoric rise and then fall from a $5.4 billion market cap


(https://www.wsj.com/articles/up-and-down-ipo-long�n-is-facing-an-sec-probe-1522712325)


demonstrated, low-�oat stocks can see incredible spikes almost at random regardless of their


quality. At the moment, we think Genprex is a buyer beware situation regardless of


directionality. Best of luck to all.
