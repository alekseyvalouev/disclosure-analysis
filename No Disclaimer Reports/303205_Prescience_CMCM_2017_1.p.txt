Prescience Point Research Opinions: 
 


• CMCM shares are worth no more than $1.69 per share.  
• ~55% of CMCM’s reported consolidated revenue does not exist. 
• CMCM should be de-listed from the NYSE. 
• CMCM will restate its historical results because of the issues exposed in this report.  
• CMCM is the subject of an ongoing, undisclosed SEC investigation, which will result in severe 


enforcement actions against CMCM and its management team. The SEC is in possession of our 
findings. 





Research Highlights: 
 


• ~87% of estimated Live.me revenue and ~57% of reported utility revenue is fabricated, based 
on PP calculations that are supported by App Annie Intelligence data.  


• CMCM is its own largest Live.me customer, based on our research – of what revenue Live.me 
does generate, we estimate 75% came from CMCM’s balance sheet and was spent in the app 
via company-controlled accounts. 


• CMCM reported that its mobile MAUs increased 17.7% from Q2’15 to Q2’17, which is not 
possible given the 49.9% decline in its core utility app MAUs, according to our calculations 
based on App Annie Intelligence data. 


• CMCM’s cash balance is suspect.(1)  From FY’14 to 1H’17, CMCM’s average cash balance 
ballooned 77.3% from $177.9m to $315.5m, yet at the same time its annualized interest income 
plummeted 67.7% from $4.5m to $1.5m --  during that time period. In spite of its sizeable cash 
balance, CMCM’s debt balance has grown to >$70m. 


• From Q2’16 to Q2’17, CMCM’s share-based compensation declined 72.9% from $13.3m to 
$3.6m.  This 72.9% YoY decline 1) appears baseless as it implies an estimated, and unrealistic 
5.4x increase in forfeiture rates, and 2) accounted for an estimated 93% of Q2’17 earnings.  


• Former employees we interviewed doubt the credibility of CMCM’s financials. Here is what 
one told us: “Sometimes the numbers on my side were going down…and at the same time we 
were reporting growing numbers in the financial statements.” 


• CMCM recently invested $40m into OrionStar, a robotics company owned by CMCM’s CEO. 
The transaction price implies a $135m post-money valuation for a company that has only 
existed for ~8 months, and that was originally intended to be a CMCM subsidiary, based on our 
research. 


• Form 144 filings CMCM does not file electronically indicate insiders have registered to sell an 
estimated $17.3m worth of CMCM stock over the past 5 months. 


• Facebook, CMCM’s largest customer, allegedly discovered the Company’s fake traffic and in 
response has been phasing out CMCM from its ad network.  Given the industry’s increased 
focus on eliminating ad fraud, we believe other top utility clients like Google will follow suit. 


• Former CMCM CFO Mr. Ka Wei Andy Yeung, a seasoned US-trained executive, was viewed 
by some as a seal of approval for the legitimacy of the Company.  He suddenly departed CMCM 
in March, and now that seal of approval is gone. 


• CMCM’s auditor E&Y Hua Ming was the auditor for Sino-Forest. Aside from Sino-Forest, it 
blessed the books of a plethora of now-proven and defunct Chinese frauds, SinoTech Energy 
and China Agritech.  


• The SEC Enforcement division is already investigating CMCM based on the responses to our 
FOIA requests. CMCM has not disclosed the investigation.

Introduction 
 
Cheetah Mobile (“CMCM” or “the Company”) bears a striking resemblance to a number of US-listed Chinese frauds Prescience Point has 
previously exposed. In this report, we present a body of evidence which in our opinion indicates that CMCM too is materially 
misrepresenting its reported financial performance and that its management is so untrustworthy that CMCM is simply uninvestable.  
 
CMCM initially caught our attention when we learned of its plans to invest in a related party entity owned by its CEO Sheng Fu. On May 26, 
2017, CMCM announced its intent to invest $40m of shareholder capital in OrionStar, an AI and robotic business, in exchange for a 29.55% 
equity stake, effectively valuing OrionStar at $95.4m on a pre-money basis. Upon further analysis, we were troubled by the circumstances 
surrounding the deal:  
 


 Only one year prior to the announcement of the deal, in April 2016, Mr. Fu announced that CMCM intended to set up a subsidiary 
called Cheetah Robotics to pursue AI/robotics. Our research indicates the legal formation of this entity did take place in May 2016.  


 Mr. Fu then appears to have hi-jacked the opportunity away from CMCM shareholders, forming his own AI and robotics company 
OrionStar in September 2016, only several months after Cheetah Robotics’ formation. Cheetah Robotics now appears to be a 
disregarded entity, as CMCM does not talk about it, it is not mentioned in CMCM SEC filings, and it is not accounted for in CMCM’s 
corporate structure as mapped out in the 2016 20-F (refer to the Appendix). 


 At the time the CMCM deal was announced, OrionStar had existed for only 8 months, casting serious doubt on the legitimacy of 
its lofty ~$100m pre-money valuation. 


OrionStar appeared to be a vehicle for the misappropriation of shareholder capital, in our view.  
 
Our interest in the CMCM story was piqued upon learning of the astounding, yet improbable success of CMCM’s Live.me business. CMCM 
launched Live.me, a mobile live streaming app, in early 2016.  From Q3’16 to Q2’17, Live.me revenue grew by an estimated 429.9% % from 
$5.9m to $31.3m, based on our estimates; thus, in the span of just nine months, annualized Live.me revenue had increased from an 
estimated $23.6m to $125.2m! This large and rapid increase in Live.me’s revenue appeared too good to be true, especially when 
considering that comparable, more well-established live streaming apps with longer operating histories were generating just a fraction of 
the revenue it claimed.   
 
The more we dug, the more we found. Our 5-month long investigation included a thorough scrub of CMCM’s public disclosures and filings, 
interviews of several former CMCM employees (including many former managers), the engagement of several private investigators, and 
exhaustive examination of App Annie Intelligence estimates and other app analytics data.  
 
We found CMCM to be worse than we initially thought: 


• Our research indicates ~55% of CMCM’s Q2’17 consolidated revenue was fabricated, including ~87% of its estimated Live.me 
revenue and ~57% of its reported utility revenue. 


• CMCM is its own largest Live.me customer, based on our research – of what revenue Live.me does generate, we estimate 75% 
came from CMCM’s balance sheet and was spent in the app via company-controlled accounts. 


• Many other aspects of CMCM’s financial reports are suspect.  Among them – CMCM’s cash balance appears to be significantly 
overstated.  From FY’14 to 1H’17, CMCM’s average cash balance ballooned 77.3% from $177.9m to $315.5m, yet at the same 
time its annualized interest income plummeted 67.7% from $4.5m to $1.5m. In spite of its sizeable cash balance, CMCM’s debt 
balance has grown to >$70m.1 


• CMCM’s auditor E&Y Hua Ming was the auditor for Sino-Forest. It has also blessed the books of a plethora of now-proven and 
defunct Chinese frauds, including SinoTech Energy and China Agritech.  


• CMCM has extensively used bots and click farms to generate fake accounts and fake ad impressions on its utility apps, according 
to former employees.  Thus, it appears that a large portion of whatever real revenue CMCM is receiving has been generated 
through questionable if not illegitimate means. 


• CMCM appears to be on the verge of imploding: Its real revenue appears to be rapidly diminishing due to a growing focus by its 
top clients, like Facebook, on cracking down on fake ad traffic; our FOIA requests have confirmed that it is the subject of an active, 
undisclosed SEC investigation; some of its key executives – including its US-trained CFO – have recently departed; and insiders

4 


have been rampantly registering their shares for sale via Form 144 filings (an estimated $17.3m worth of CMCM stock over the 
past 5 months). 


We are not alone in our suspicions related to CMCM; consider the following comments from our interviews with several former CMCM 
managers: 
 


Former Employee #1: One of the reasons I left the company is there is definitely some fuzzy accounting going on… saI’ve worked 
with a lot Chinese companies, and I know they do business differently, but Cheetah is a different scale in terms of how worried I 
would be. 
 
Former Employee #2: I was never able to understand the numbers that were published in the financial statements of the 
Company…Sometimes the numbers on my side were going down… and at the same time we were reporting growing numbers in 
the financial statements. 
 
Former Employee #3: … they make up (the numbers) for sure… People they watch the news and (the news) says “Cheetah Mobile 
has increased their revenue”.  (But) every weekly meeting we had, we definitely see the downloads is going down when I was 
working there...I mean they must do something to the numbers…There’s definitely something wrong with the company, so that’s 
why I left 


 
Over the years, we have successfully exposed several fraudulent US-listed Chinese companies (read more about them here, here and here).  
Following the publication of our findings, these companies collapsed, were investigated by the SEC, had their shares delisted, and/or ceased 
to exist.  We believe CMCM will soon meet a similar fate due to the issues covered in this report. 
 
We hope that current and future investors and creditors familiarize themselves with the risks we have addressed and take immediate 
action to preserve the value of their holdings. We also hope that the NYSE, regulatory and law enforcement agencies, and CMCM’s 
auditor take necessary precautions in protecting investors.

Company Overview 
 
CMCM is a China-based developer of mobile (iOS and Android) and PC applications.  In Q2’17, mobile accounted for 86.5% of CMCM’s total 
revenue, while PC accounted for the remaining 13.5%.  The Company generates the majority of its revenue from international markets 
outside of China such as the US, UK, etc.  
 
CMCM discloses its revenue by business line as follows:  
 
• Utility products & related services (“utility revenue”) – Consists primarily of revenue 


generated from in-app advertising in CMCM’s mobile utility apps.  The Company’s core 
mobile utility apps include Clean Master, CM Security, Battery Doctor, CM Launcher, CM 
Browser, Photo Grid and CM Locker.2 


• Content driven products (“content revenue”) – Consists of revenue generated from 
Live.me and News Republic.3  Live.me is a live video streaming mobile app for iOS and 
Android devices.  News Republic is a personalized news aggregator app for iOS and 
Android devices.  We estimate Live.me accounted for >97% of content driven revenue in 
Q2’17. 


• Mobile games – Consists primarily of revenue generated from advertising and virtual 
currency purchases in CMCM’s web-based and mobile games.  Some of its most popular 
games include Tap Tap Fish, Piano Tiles 2 and Rolling Sky. 


• Other – Miscellaneous revenue representing just a small portion of CMCM’s business. 
 
CMCM went public on the NYSE in May 2014 as a spin-off from Kingsoft Corporation, a large IT service provider and software developer 
traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.  From FY’13 to FY’16, the Company grew its reported revenue by 430% from $123.9m to $657.4m.  
CMCM’s revenue has continued to grow in FY’17 – In Q2’17, CMCM’s reported revenue grew 14.8% YoY to $177.2m, or $708.8m on an 
annualized basis. 
 
Below is the Company’s historical consolidated revenue according to SEC filings and earnings releases: 
 


  
We will provide a body of evidence that we believe indicates the data in the chart above is fiction.
6 


Is More than 87% of CMCM’s “Reported” Live.me Revenue Fabricated? 
 
In late 2015, CMCM launched Live.me, a live video streaming mobile app for iOS and Android devices.  In Q2’2016, the Company introduced  a 
revenue-generating virtual gifting function to the app.4 Since then, Live.me revenue has grown exponentially, increasing an estimated 429.9% 
from $5.9m in Q3’16 to $31.3m in Q2’17, based on our estimates.  Thus, in the span of just nine months, annualized Live.me revenue has 
increased from an estimated $23.6m to $125.2m! Due to its rapid growth, CMCM management has touted Live.me as one of the pillars of 
the Company’s future.  
 


Based on our months long investigation, however, Live.me’s astounding success is a mirage.  We have collected evidence which, in our view, 
amounts to a smoking gun that the majority of Live.me revenue is fabricated. Our conclusion is based on the following analytical summary, 
the basis for which is thoroughly supported in the sections that follow: 
 


• The dollar value of gifting on Live.me is suspiciously large, especially when compared against that of its more well-established 
direct comp YouNow: For Q2’17, “Reported” Live.me gross revenue was an estimated $31.3m. (Note: throughout this document, 
“Reported” denotes our estimates based on CMCM’s financial reports, public disclosures, and/or an interview of CMCM 
management.)  Based on a call with CMCM management, 100% of Live.me gross revenue is generated from in-app gift purchases 
(as such, henceforth, we use the terms “gross revenue” and “gifting” interchangeably).  Thus, we estimate that gifting on Live.me 
also totaled $31.3m in Q2’17, or $125.2m annualized. When compared against its closest comp YouNow, the gifting from Live.me’s 
platform does not seem possible. Our calculations for YouNow gross revenue based on App Annie Intelligence data indicate it 
generated ~$4.0m of gross revenue in Q2’17, meaning Live.me’s “Reported” gross revenue was 8x YouNow gross revenue.  The 
enormous variance makes little sense given that YouNow introduced virtual gifting as its primary monetization strategy back in 
2014 and appears to have more active users than Live.me.  


• Based on App Annie Intelligence data, Prescience Point calculates Live.me generated “actual” Q2’17 gross revenue of $16.3m, 
indicating “Reported” Live.me revenue is inflated by 92%:  According to CMCM management, 100% of Live.me revenue is 
generated, 1) via its mobile platform (as opposed to via PC), and 2) from gifting (vs other monetization models such as 
advertisements). As a result, App Annie Intelligence estimates should account for 100% of Live.me’s revenue streams. Given the 
high level of data accuracy of App Annie Intelligence estimates, in our view this amounts to incontrovertible proof that the amount 
of gifting on Live.me is much less than reported. 


• Our in-app research indicates CMCM is its own largest customer, using company-controlled (or, “fake”) accounts to inflate the 
gifting on Live.me. If true, our estimate of $16.3m for Live.me’s “actual” Q2’17 revenue (based on App Annie Intelligence 
estimates) overstates Live.me’s legitimately-generated revenue (“legitimate” revenue): We provide evidence from our in-app 
investigation which, in our view, indicates the Company is cycling $millions of gifts back-and-forth between these fake accounts to 
inflate the gifting on the app.  Our research is backed by claims of such activity made by former employees. Of the $16.3m of 
estimated gift purchases in Q2’17, we believe that the vast majority of these purchases were funded by CMCM, while only a small 
amount came from legitimate users. 


• PP estimates that more than 87% of “Reported” Q2’17 Live.me revenue was fabricated: In an effort toward estimating legitimate 
gifting on the Live.me app, and thereby its true financial performance, we give the company credit by using YouNow revenue as a 
proxy. We estimate that Live.me gross revenue was at most $4.0m in Q2’17.  Thus, we estimate that CMCM overstated its 
“Reported” Live.me revenue in Q2’17 by $27.3m or $109.1m annualized.

 Quick Overview of Live.me’s Business Model 


 
Live.me is a live-streaming app available for both Android and iOS devices.  With its focus on virtual gifting, Live.me’s business model is 
very similar to YouNow, a competing live streaming app which was launched several years earlier in 2011. 
 
• In-app gifting:  Broadcasters on Live.me can earn real money from users via the app’s gifting system.  Live.me users can live stream images 


of themselves to other users on the app by using the “selfie” cameras on their mobile phones.  During the live stream, broadcasters sing, 
dance, crack jokes or simply talk to attract as many viewers as possible.   


Viewers of the live stream can use real money to buy virtual coins.  If a viewer likes what they see, they can show their appreciation by using 
their virtual coins to purchase virtual gifts, such as a castle or Ferrari, for a broadcaster.  Each virtual gift corresponds to a certain number of 
diamonds – more expensive gifts = more diamonds.  Broadcasters can later cash-out these virtual diamonds for real money. Based on our 
research, money that is spent by a US-based Live.me user on the app is divvied up as follows:  ~35.7% of gross goes to CMCM, ~30.0% of 
gross goes to the app store (i.e. Apple Store, Google Play Store), and the remaining ~34.3% of gross goes to the broadcaster.  
 





• Revenue and cost recognition: CMCM reports Live.me revenue on a gross basis, and records the payments to the app store and 
broadcasters as cost of revenues.5 So, in reference to the transactional diagram above, when 1m coins are used to purchase gifts for a 
broadcaster, the Company reports $14.3K of revenue and books the $4.3K app store payment and $4.9K broadcaster payment in cost 
of sales: 


 
 
• 100% of Live.me’s gross revenue is generated on the mobile platform and from virtual gifting (i.e., in-app gifting), based on CMCM’s public 


disclosures and our researcher’s interview with management.6 As such in the remainder of this report we use the terms “gross revenue” and 
“gifting” interchangeably.
8 


 Gifting Claimed by Live.me Defies Logic in Comparison to YouNow 
 
Live streaming is not some new, unexploited business opportunity. YouNow – a directly comparable live streaming app that monetizes 
virtual gifts – is very similar to Live.me, but it’s been around a lot longer. It was founded in 2011 and introduced virtual gifting as its primary 
monetization strategy on July 15, 2014, with the release of its version 6.5 app.7 We compared Live.me to YouNow as another measure of 
the credibility of Live.me’s astounding performance. 
 
The results are startling.  
• From July 2014, the month YouNow introduced virtual gifting, through March 2016, YouNow was downloaded a whopping >13 million 


times. We presume this large growth in users is what drove YouNow’s gross revenues to reach a peak of $4.99m in Q1’16.8 Live.me, 
on the other hand, generated an estimated ~$5.9m in Q3’16, only 1-2 quarters after introducing gifting. Are we to believe its revenue 
exploded beyond YouNow’s just by virtue of having introduced a feature YouNow already offered, when YouNow had a ~2 year head 
start in growing its paying user base and was successful in doing so?? 


• Whereas YouNow’s gross revenue peaked in Q1’16 at ~$4.99m, Live.me’s revenue has grown to an estimated ~$31.3m in Q2’17.9 
Furthermore, per the chart below, we estimate Live.me is generating almost 8x as much in-app gifting as YouNow as of Q2’17! 


 
 
Note: App Annie Intelligence revenue estimates are reported net of the app store commission, which is typically 30%.   Accordingly, 
Prescience Point’s calculates gross revenue based on App Annie Intelligence data by grossing the data up to reflect this. 
 


A couple observations: YouNow has been employing the same business model as Live.me for over 3 years; and, its revenues peaked almost 
2 years ago.  
 
Could it be true that the size of the market opportunity is relatively small, isn’t growing, and cannot allow for the success of more than one 
or a few entrants? Alternatively, what might enable a new entrant with only a few quarters of operating experience to generate multiples 
of the revenue generated by the much more established player? 
 
Perhaps Live.me has a much larger base of active users, and is thereby the beneficiary of powerful network effects. We hesitate to test this 
hypothesis using data accessible to us for downloads or app store rankings, because these metrics are easily gamed and may be misdirecting 
as proxies for active users – in fact, former employees we interviewed claim CMCM makes extensive use of bots and click farms (more on 
that in a later section). However, we can look to online search trends to gauge general consumer interest, which we can assume to be 
indicative of the relative sizes of these companies’ active user bases.  



https://www.cultofmac.com/311171/crazy-iphone-rig-shows-chinese-workers-manipulate-app-store-rankings/
9 


 
 
Based on the Google Trends comparison above, YouNow generates much higher online search interest compared to Live.me. Further, 
Live.me has never generated more search interest than YouNow. In our view the results indicate that YouNow’s base of active users is much 
larger than Live.me’s. 
 
We can also look to other social media platforms for information that could shed more light on these companies’ active user bases. For 
example, a study of each app’s top 5 broadcasters reveals that Live.me’s top 5 broadcasters have a cumulative total of 54.5K and 122.4K 
Twitter and Instagram followers, respectively, while YouNow’s top 5 ranked broadcasters have 1.8M and 4.1M Twitter and Instagram 
followers, respectively.  Thus, YouNow’s top 5 broadcasters have 33.0x and 33.5x more followers on Twitter and Instagram, respectively, 
than those on Live.me. Assuming that the most talented and well-recognized Live.me/YouNow broadcasters’ fans ought to follow them 
outside these apps, which would translate to follows on other social media platforms, this also indicates YouNow has more active users 
than Live.me. 
 


 
 
 
Obviously, strong operating performance alone would not normally be cause for concern. But when a company is doing as well as Live.me, 
investors need to understand both why and how. We cannot understand either why or how.  Live.me is either one of the most incredible 
growth stories we have witnessed, or CMCM’s financial statements are a fiction.

 PP Estimates Based on App Annie Intelligence Data Indicate Actual Q2’17 Gifting on Live.me was ~50% Of 
“Reported”  


 
Prescience Point’s calculations based on App Annie Intelligence Data indicate that ~48% of “Reported” Live.me revenue is fabricated – in 
our view, serving as incontrovertible proof that CMCM has inflated its revenue, based on the following: 


o Because all Live.me revenue 1) is generated via its mobile application, and 2) is from virtual gifting, App Annie Intelligence 
estimates, when grossed up to adjust for an assumed 30% app store commission, account for 100% of Live.me’s revenue 
streams.  


o Our calculation for Live.me revenue based on App Annie data is so much lower than indicated by Live.me’s public disclosures 
that it’s obvious it cannot be explained by a rounding error.  


• We calculate based on App Annie Intelligence estimates that Live.me generated $16.3m of gross revenue in Q2’17. Our calculations 
indicate that ~$15m, or ~48%, of Live.me revenue is fabricated. Our calculation was made by grossing up the App Annie Intelligence 
estimate for Live.me revenue by 30% to adjust for the app store commission, which is not included in the App Annie estimate.  


 
Note that we are prohibited by App Annie’s data usage policy from displaying the App Annie Intelligence estimate itself.  However, 
the raw data is available to all who cross App Annie’s paywall.  


  
• The divergence is too large to be explained by simple rounding error: Our calculation for Live.me revenue based on App Annie 


Intelligence estimates should be a close approximation of the actual amount of gifting in Q2’17. 
 
According to representatives from App Annie, in-app purchase estimates on the site have a margin of error of 20% for 80% of the 
apps.  The accuracy is generally even higher for top ranked apps, like Live.me, and lower for less popular apps. 





PP: Do you know generally what your margin of error is? 





AA: For all of our data we are within 20% of confidence, 80% of the time is what our data science team ultimately tells 
us…The more popular the market and the category, the more accurate we tend to be…We have had our accuracy 
tested extensively 





PP: I would assume that for the more popular apps, like the top maybe 100, it would be more accurate than the lesser 
ranked apps.  Would that be correct?

AA: Yes…Snapchat we’ve been within I think like 1 or 2 percent for the last five quarter…Zynga, they just reported 
yesterday, and we actually were right on the dot. 


 
Live.me consistently ranked in or close to the top 50 grossing apps on iOS and Android in Q2’17.  Thus, based on our dialogue with 
App Annie reps, in-app purchase estimates for Live.me should have fallen well within a 20% margin of error. We asked the same 
representatives whether it was possible that App Annie’s estimate for a top-ranked app like Live.me could be off by more than 92% 
(as shown in the above table).  In response, they stated that it was highly unlikely:  
 


It’s highly unlikely…That big of a difference I personally haven’t seen. 





 Is CMCM Itself Live.me’s Largest Customer? Our Calcs Based on App Annie Intelligence Data Appear to 
Grossly Overstate ‘Legitimate’ Live.me Gifting 


  
It gets worse. The Live.me revenue accounted for by App Annie Intelligence estimates, and hence our calculation of $16.3m Q2’17 gross 
revenue, may significantly overstate legitimate gifting on the app. Our research indicates CMCM may be using $millions of its own money 
(i.e., shareholder capital) to inflate gifting on the app. 
  
We spoke with several former CMCM employees believed to have detailed knowledge of the Live.me business.  We were told that CMCM 
has been using company-controlled accounts to inflate the gifting on Live.me. Based our own investigation, we believe these claims to be 
true.  
 
Our in-app research suggests that CMCM controls the majority of the largest gifting accounts on Live.me and cycles $millions of gifts back-
and-forth between these accounts to inflate the gifting on the app.  We conclude that ~75% of the $16.3m of Q2’17 gifting we calculated 
based on App Annie estimates was funded by CMCM itself – or, the result of “illegitimate” gifting –  while only 25% was from real users (or, 
“legitimate” gifting).  The wealth of evidence in support of our conclusion is thoroughly detailed in the sections that follow.
12 


Note: In the below sections we may use the term “fake accounts” in reference to Live.me user profiles that are controlled or affiliated with 
CMCM. 
 


According to Former Employees, CMCM is Using Fake Accounts to Inflate the Gifting on Live.me 
 
We spoke with former CMCM employees believed to have detailed knowledge of the Live.me business.  We were told that CMCM uses 
company-controlled, or “fake”, accounts on Live.me to gift other users using company money. We were also told, and found evidence 
indicating, that CMCM hires its own Live.me broadcasters, and that these broadcasters’ accounts are also controlled by the Company.  
Finally, we were told that CMCM is using these fake broadcaster and gifter accounts to inflate the gifting on the Live.me app. 
 
The relevant extracts from our conversation with this individual are provided below.  Please note that some of the responses were provided 
to us through a translator. 
 


Former Employee: I don’t know if you know the product Live.me…So, they hire a lot of young girls doing the live 
(streaming) on the app.  So, they (Cheetah) work with an agency.  So, the agency finds lots of young girls.  They have 
talent.  They sing.  They do some stupid things when they’re doing the live show - to attract the user to watch them. 


Former Employee (via a translator): What she’s saying is that Cheetah will go and hire good looking girls to live 
stream, and then what they’ll do is they’ll put money into their live stream, give them gifts. 


PP: You’re saying that Cheetah would give the broadcaster their own money into the app, or feed it into the app…? 


Former Employee: Yes. 


PP: So, are these accounts, including the broadcaster accounts, controlled by the Company then? 


Former Employee: Yes. 


PP: Because they need to control the money, right? 


Former Employee: Yeah, they control the money and also the account, correct. 


 
Another former employee we interviewed backed the above claims with hearsay knowledge. Speaking through a translator, this individual 
told us the following: 
 


Former Employee (via a translator): He said that he’s aware of, or he had heard of individuals that will go into different 
live streams and they’ll have money from the company to then spend on the live streamers and give them gifts. 


 
Lastly, yet another former CMCM employee we interviewed claimed that CMCM hires broadcasters to produce content for Live.me.  This 
individual referred to them as “Cheetah employees.”  The following are the relevant excerpts from our discussion with this individual: 


 
Former Employee: They’ve hired a bunch of people to produce content on Live.me, right, and to essentially seed the 
machine.  So, a lot of the content that’s on Live.me is actually produced by Cheetah employees. 


We present evidence in the form of a recent online casting call made for paid-by-the-hour Live.me broadcasters – which in our view bolsters 
the assertion that CMCM hires its own broadcasters and controls their user accounts – in the Appendix. In the section below, we present 
compelling evidence from our in-app investigation we believe suggests that CMCM is using fake accounts to inflate the gifting on Live.me.

Most of Live.me’s Top Ranked Broadcaster Accounts Appear to be Controlled By CMCM 
 
In conducting in-app research, we were shocked to discover that most of the top 30 ranked broadcasters on Live.me had little interest in 
cashing out the millions of dollars they had earned. Instead they gave all or most of their earnings away, by buying gifts for other users 
(with many buying more in gifts than they had collected). We estimate that collectively, the top 30 broadcasters earned >$4 million, yet 
gave away more than they earned, losing an estimated $259.8k! Isn’t an income stream, as represented by the receiving and cashing out 
of virtual gifts, supposed to be a reward for hard working broadcasters who had spent large amounts of their time performing and building 
fan bases?  Why then are their earnings all being spent on other Live.me users and staying inside the app? 
 
In our view such activity violates the norms of human behavior, violates the tenets of the app itself, and benefits one entity on a wholesale 
basis – Cheetah Mobile. As such, we believe most of the top ranked broadcaster accounts are CMCM-affiliated and controlled. 
  
• Top broadcasters on Live.me are inexplicably giving away all of their earnings: Live.me publishes a leaderboard of its top 30 


broadcasters, ranking users based on the amount of gifts they have received during their live streams. Top broadcasters on the app 
have received $hundreds-of-thousands in gifts from their fans.  Yet, instead of keeping and cashing out their earnings, the majority of 
these broadcasters are inexplicably giving most or all of them away by purchasing large amounts of gifts for other users. 
 
Based on our estimates and as demonstrated in the table below,  


1. 25 of the top 30 broadcasters on Live.me have spent 70% or more of their earnings on gift purchases for other users.   
2. In total, these broadcasters have received an estimated $4.4M in gifts but have spent $4.7M on gifts for their fans.   
3. Thus, on an overall basis, the top 30 broadcasters on Live.me have lost an estimated $259.8K!

• We believe the majority of the top 30 broadcaster accounts are controlled by CMCM: While one would think the primary motivation 
for these broadcasters is to make money, most them appear to have no interest in doing so.  In our view, the most likely explanation 
for this puzzling behavior is that these broadcasters (i.e. broadcasters who have given away 70% or more of their earnings) are CMCM 
employees and their accounts are under the Company’s control.  As we will later explain in more detail, we think based on the body 
of evidence collected, that CMCM is using these broadcaster accounts in a scheme to inflate gifting on the app. 


 
Furthermore, our in-app research indicates that former employee claims – that CMCM uses company controlled accounts to increase gifting 
on Live.me – likely have merit, as detailed in the following two subsections. 
 


Bots Gone Wild? Live.me’s Top Two Gifter Accounts Appear to be Funded and Controlled by CMCM 
 
We observed the accounts of Live.me’s top 2 gifters over time – who have collectively bought $1.1m worth of gifts over the ~1.5 years since 
Live.me’s inception – and witnessed the same bizarre and random activity in both accounts, suggesting a link between the two accounts 
and, potentially, they are operated by bots; the accounts appear to be controlled by a common entity. Of course, we believe that entity is… 
CMCM. 
 
(Note: For a comprehensive primer on the use of bots by dishonest social media platforms, read Ashley Madison Code Shows More Women, 
and More Bots.) 
 
• We observed bizarre and random, potentially bot-driven, changes made to the user profile of the #1 gifter: Over a period of about 


two weeks, we observed highly unusual and frequent changes to the profile of the #1 ranked gifter on Live.me.  From July 25th to 
August 8th, the user name of this account changed a total of three times from Ice King on July 25th to SofieElizabeth on August 2nd to 
Ice Cube on August 3rd and finally back to IceKing on August 8th (this time with no space between “Ice” and “King”): 





 
 
 
Even more unusual than the frequent name changes was this person’s apparent transformation from a black male on July 25th to a 
white female on August 2nd and then subsequent transformation back to the same black male on August 3rd:

https://gizmodo.com/ashley-madison-code-shows-more-women-and-more-bots-1727613924
15 


• We observed the same type of strange activity in the user profile of the #2 gifter: Like the #1 gifter, the #2 gifter’s name changed a 
total of three times over the span of about two weeks from Therealking on July 25th to Wise Owl on August 2nd to ScottishMichael on 
August 4th and then finally back to Wise Owl on August 7th.  During that same time, like the #1 ranked gifter once again, this user’s 
profile pic also changed several times. 
 





• Bots on bad code? Live.me’s #1 and #2 ranked gifters used the same exact profile pic on different dates. Specifically, the #2 ranked 
gifter’s profile picture on August 4th was the same as the #1 ranked gifter’s profile picture on August 2nd. 





 
 
• We believe these are fake accounts controlled by the same entity:  We believe the top two gifters on Live.me must be fake accounts.  


A legitimate user, in our view, would not make such frequent and nonsensical changes to their profiles.  We also believe that these 
accounts must be controlled by the same entity.  We believe it is not likely two unrelated entities would both make such frequent, 
similar, and bizarre changes to their profiles, or that the top 2 gifters on the entire app would use the same profile pic on different 
days. 
 


• We believe these accounts must belong to CMCM: It also stands to reason that the accounts of the top two gifters on Live.me must 
belong to CMCM.  Based on data provided on Live.me’s gifter leaderboard, these two users have spent a combined total of over $1.1m 
on gifts for broadcasters!  We cannot think of another party, besides CMCM, that would have the funds as well as the incentive to 
operate illegitimate accounts and give away $millions.

The Majority of the Top 30 Ranked Gifter Accounts Appear to be Funded and Controlled by CMCM  
 
Looking beyond Live.me’s top two gifters, the other top ranked gifters on the app are also spending unbelievable amounts of money.  We 
find it hard to believe that real users would have the means or willingness to spend their hard-earned money so frivolously. As a result, we 
believe the majority of the top 30 gifter accounts on Live.me must be funded and controlled by CMCM.    
 
Live.me publishes a leaderboard of its top 30 gifters, ranking users by the amount of money spent on gifts.  As of September 6th, the top 30 
gifters have spent an estimated average of $199.2K on gift purchases for broadcasters since inception!  Even when excluding the top two 
gifters, whom we believe to be fake, we estimate the average is still well into six-figures at almost $172.6K.  Also, it is important to keep in 
mind that Live.me launched less than 1.5 years ago, meaning that this money was spent in a very compressed timeframe. 
 
A summary of Live.me’s gifter leaderboard is provided below: 
 





Actual Live.me Users also Suspect that CMCM is Funding Gifting on the App 
 
The levels of gifting taking place on Live.me are so unbelievable, that even users are left scratching their heads speculating whether CMCM 
is funding the gift purchases: 
 
• In a comment posted online, a Live.me user speculated whether CMCM was funding the gifting on the app:  In the comments section 


of a YouTube video, a Live.me user noted that a random user was giving out $thousands of gifts during a broadcast.  This individual 
expressed disbelief that a legitimate user would “throw money out like it’s nothing” and speculated whether the gifter was affiliated 
with CMCM:

• Another Live.me user expressed similar doubts, questions the legitimacy of gifting on Live.me: In a comment posted on Facebook, 
another Live.me user expressed a great deal of skepticism over the legitimacy of the gifting on the app.  This user noted that a large 
portion of Live.me’s users appeared to be fake accounts or bots.  This user also noted that the amount of gifts that Live.me 
broadcasters were receiving in a day was as much as what broadcasters on other comparable apps were making in a month.  Given 
that other live streaming apps appeared to have more “real viewers” than Live.me, this large discrepancy in gifting did not make sense 
to him/her: 





 
 Gift Cycling: The Most Cost-Effective Way to Carry Out a Cash-Consuming Scheme 


 
 
Not only does the evidence presented indicate CMCM is using fake gifter and broadcaster accounts to inflate the gifting on Live.me, 
additional evidence presented in this section suggests CMCM is cycling gifts back and forth between these accounts in order to inflate 
gifting in the most cost-effective manner. As our research demonstrates, employing this strategy is much cheaper for CMCM than other 
alternatives to inflate revenue.

• Top broadcasters are engaging in rampant gift cycling with their #1 ranked fans:  We have discovered that top broadcasters and their 
#1 ranked fans are engaging in rampant gift cycling on the app. 
 
Included in the profile of every Live.me user is a top fans leaderboard which ranks fans based on the amount of gifts (i.e. diamonds) 
they have sent to the user.  TheRealKatherineRojas was the #1 ranked user on Live.me’s broadcaster leaderboard as of September 6th.  
TheRealKatherineRojas’s #1 ranked fan was THEREALFIREGOD!, who had sent her a total of 14.6m diamonds.  Interestingly, 
THEREALFIREGOD’s top fan was none other than TheRealKatherineRojas, who had sent him a total of 5.5m diamonds. They were each 
other’s #1 fan: 
 


 
 
As we noted earlier, our research indicates broadcasters on Live.me only take a ~35% cut of the gifts they receive during live streams.  
Because of this, TheRealKatherineRojas has actually spent ~$7.1k more on gifts for THEREALFIREGOD! than what she has received 
($71.7K received vs $78.8K spent).  In other words, she has sent all the money she received from THEREALFIREGOD! right back to him 
and then some!  


  
 
This unusual behavior is not isolated to TheRealKatherineRojas or a few accounts. The majority of the top 30 broadcasters on Live.me 
are engaging in gift cycling with their #1 ranked fans.  Our analysis indicates (as shown in the table below) that 19 of the top 30 


TheRealKatherineRojas's Top Fan Leaderboard THEREALFIREGOD's Top Fan Leaderboard
19 


broadcasters on Live.me have spent 70% or more of their earnings on gifts for their #1 fan, and that in total, the top 30 broadcasters 
on Live.me have received $479.4K and spent $851.8K on their #1 fan.  Thus, on an overall basis, the top 30 broadcasters have given all 
their earnings and then some right back to their top fan. 
 





    
• Top broadcasters are cycling gifts with not only their #1 fan, but many others as well:  As we highlighted previously, the top 30 


broadcasters on Live.me have collectively earned an estimated $4.4M in gifts but have spent $4.7M on gifts for other users.  Based on 
this, it appears that most of the top 30 broadcasters on Live.me are cycling gifts with numerous fans, not just their top ranked ones.  
It also appears that the majority of the gifting associated with these top broadcaster accounts is from gift cycling. 
 


• Countless other top ranked users (outside the top 30) are engaging in gift cycling: Live.me also publishes a weekly broadcaster 
leaderboard in which users are ranked based on the amount of gifts they received in a given week.  Our research indicates that the 
users on these leaderboards were also engaging in a significant amount of gift cycling with their fans. 
 
For example, provided in the table below is a summary of Live.me’s weekly leaderboard published on September 6th. Based on our 
analysis, 17 of the 30 broadcasters on this leaderboard spent 70% or more of their earnings on gifts for their #1 fan over a one-week

period.  Per the table below, in total we estimate these broadcasters received $26.3K and spent $45.5K on their #1 fan, indicating that 
these users were engaging in a substantial amount of gift cycling. 
 





• In our view, the majority of the gifting on Live.me is likely fabricated: Based on the time periods in which we assessed the 
business, it appears that most of the gifting associated with the top broadcaster accounts on Live.me is from gift cycling between 
fake accounts, meaning between CMCM and itself.   


Gift Cycling Is A (Relatively) Cheap Way to Inflate the Gifting (i.e. Revenue) On Live.me 
 
If CMCM wanted to inflate its revenue, what benefit does it derive from gift cycling between fake accounts?  In addition to the obvious 
reason of inflating the gifting on Live.me, employing this strategy is much cheaper than other alternatives. 
 
For example, if CMCM purchases a gift for a legitimate broadcaster through a company-controlled account, we estimate that a 30.0% cut 
goes to the app-store, a 34.3% cut goes to the broadcaster, and the remaining 35.7% goes back to CMCM.  By comparison, if CMCM uses

its own gifter account to purchase a gift for its own broadcaster account, it only has to give an estimated 30.0% cut to the app store.  Since 
it controls the broadcaster account, the Company would recoup the remaining 70.0%. 
 
To further illustrate, in order to inflate the gifting on Live.me by $100, CMCM would have to spend an estimated $64.3 if it purchases the 
gift for a legitimate broadcaster.  By comparison, the Company would only have to spend an estimated $30.0 if it purchases the gift for its 
own broadcaster account.  This is 53.3% less than the $64.3 it would spend in the first scenario.   
 


  
 
Accordingly, if CMCM were inclined to inflate its revenue, gift cycling is the least costly/most efficient way to do it. 
 
 


 Prescience Point Estimates that ~87% of Q2’17 Live.me Revenue is Fabricated 
 
As we’ve demonstrated, our research indicates that most of the top broadcaster and gifter accounts on Live.me are controlled by CMCM 
and most of these top accounts are engaged in rampant gift cycling; accordingly, we believe most gifts purchased on Live.me are purchased 
by CMCM, for itself, and is therefore illegitimate. As a result, we believe that our calculation of actual Live.me revenue based on App Annie 
Intelligence estimates overstates the its financial performance; in other words, we believe that legitimate Live.me revenue was far less than 
$16.3m in Q2’17.   
 
To derive a more realistic estimate of Live.me’s financial performance, we look to its closest comp – YouNow.  Given that YouNow appears 
to have more active users than Live.me, we believe that actual Live.me revenue was at most equivalent to YouNow’s, and likely far less. As 
such, we believe it is conservative to use YouNow revenue as a proxy for Live.me’s. 
 
We calculate, based on App Annie Intelligence data, that YouNow generated $4.0m of in-app gross revenue in Q2’17.  By comparison, 
Live.me accounted for an estimated $31.3m of CMCM reported revenue in Q2’17.  Thus, we estimate that CMCM inflated its Live.me 
revenue in Q2’17 by $27.3m, or $109.1m annualized.
22 


Inflation of Q2’17 Utility Revenue – Is More Than 57% Fabricated? 
 
We believe CMCM’s utility revenue is also fabricated. Our research included interviews of several former employees we believe to have 
detailed knowledge of CMCM’s utility business, including three former managers and a former software engineer. Every one of these 
individuals expressed concern over the accuracy of CMCM’s utility business, with most expressing skepticism over the company’s public 
financial reporting or internally distributed metrics. One expressed doubt about CMCM’s reported MAUs.   
 
We performed a thorough analysis of the utility business to determine the veracity of these claims.  Based on our findings, which are 
summarized below, they have merit: 
 


• Total reported utility revenue was $121.0m in Q2’17 or $484.0m on a run-rate basis: CMCM reported that its total utility revenue 
was $121.0m.  We estimate that mobile apps accounted for $110.1m (91.0%) of this amount, while PC apps accounted for just 
$10.9m (9.0%). 


• CMCM’s reported mobile MAUs appear significantly overstated: From Q2’15 to Q2’17, CMCM reported a 17.7% increase in its 
mobile MAUs.  However, our calculations based on App Annie Intelligence data suggest the MAUs of CMCM’s core mobile utility 
apps declined by 49.9% during that same time period.  Accordingly, we conclude the Company has grossly inflated its reported 
mobile MAUs. 


• The Company’s mobile utility revenue appears to be overstated as well: From Q2’15 to Q2’17, “Reported” mobile utility revenue 
increased by an estimated 35.9% from $81.0m to $110.1m.  We do not believe this growth in mobile utility revenue is possible 
given that, as our analysis indicates, 1) the MAUs of CMCM’s core mobile utility apps declined by an estimated 49.9% during this 
time and 2) the Company’s largest customer – Facebook – significantly reduced the amount of CMCM utility inventory on its ad 
network.  Given these headwinds, we believe that mobile utility revenue should, instead, have declined from Q2’15 to Q2’17. 


• Prescience Point estimates that more than 57% of reported utility revenue in Q2’17 was fabricated: CMCM’s “Reported” mobile 
utility revenue in Q2’15 was an estimated $81.0m.  By applying the 49.9% decrease in CMCM’s core mobile utility MAUs from 
Q2’15 to Q2’17 to this amount, we estimate ‘actual’ mobile utility revenue of $40.6m.  Adding $40.6m of mobile utility revenue 
to $10.9m of PC utility revenue, we estimate that ‘actual’ total utility revenue was $51.5m in Q2’17.  Thus, we conclude that 
CMCM overstated its utility revenue in Q2’17 by $69.5m, or $277.9m annualized.

 Quick Background on the Utility Business 
 
Before discussing our findings in more detail, we have first provided below some background information on the utility business:  
 
• Brief description of CMCM’s utility apps: The Company’s two most popular mobile utility apps are Clean Master and CM Security 


(formerly Security Master).  Some of the Company’s other mobile utility apps include Battery Doctor, CM Launcher, CM Browser, Photo 
Grid and CM Locker. CMCM’s 2016 20-F refers to these 6 apps as its “core” utility applications, as do we in this report. CMCM also 
provides utility apps for the PC, but this accounts for only a small and declining portion of its utility business today. 
 
The Company claims that its mobile utility apps will optimize a phone’s performance by boosting it memory, extending its battery life, 
protecting it against security threats, etc. (As we discuss in a subsequent section, many experts believe these apps are functionally 
useless and potentially detrimental to a phone’s performance.) 


Clean Master is a junk file cleaning, memory boosting and privacy protection tool” 





CM Security, which we launched in January 2014 on the Android platform, is an anti-virus and security application for 
mobile devices. 





Battery Doctor optimizes battery usage by utilizing our cloud-based application behavior library that contains power 
consumption characteristics of a number of mobile applications. 


 
• Breakdown of Q2’17 utility revenue: In Q2’17, reported utility revenue was $121.0m which represented 68.3% of total reported 


revenue.  Of this amount, as explained in the table above, we estimate that mobile accounted for 91.0% of reported utility revenue, 
while just 9.0% was from PC.  Almost all of the revenue that the Company generates from its utility apps comes from in-app advertising. 


• Utility revenue and online marketing services revenue are almost equivalent: From FY’14 to FY’16, CMCM included all its utility 
revenue in a business segment called “online marketing services.”  Beginning in Q1’17, CMCM changed its financial reporting by 
organizing its business segments by product line rather than by service.  As a result, CMCM now reports utility revenue (mobile + PC) 
in a separate segment called “utility products and related services” (or, “utility revenue”), while online marketing services is no longer 
reported. 
 
In some of the analysis to follow, we will be using online marketing services revenue as a proxy for utility revenue in periods prior to 
Q1’17.  This makes sense given that 1) CMCM’s online marketing services revenue came almost entirely from in-app advertising on its 
utility apps and 2) almost all of the utility app revenue comes from in-app advertising.  In other words, online marketing services 
revenue and utility revenue are almost the same thing.  (See Appendix for additional support for this assumption.) 


 
 Former Employees: CMCM’s Reported Utility Revenue and MAUs do not Add Up 


 
We spoke with several former CMCM employees with detailed knowledge of the Company’s utility business.  These employees included 1) 
a former manager in the utility division, 2) another former manager in the utility division, 3) a former marketing manager, and 4) a former 
engineer in the utility division. 
 
Every one of these individuals expressed concern over the accuracy of CMCM’s utility business, with most expressing skepticism over the 
company’s public financial reporting or internally distributed metrics.  One expressed doubt about CMCM’s reported MAUs.  We summarize 
some of their most concerning claims and provide relevant extracts from our interviews in the following bullets:
24 


● While internal numbers were showing that utility downloads and impressions were going down, reported revenue was somehow 
increasing at that time. 
 


Former Employee: I don’t exactly know how they make up their number(s), definitely they do something for the public 
financial reports.  People they watch the news and (the news) says “Cheetah Mobile has increased their revenue”.  
(But) every weekly meeting we had, we definitely see the downloads is going down when I was working there...I mean 
they must do something to the numbers. 





They’re going down (downloads) and the impressions are going down too.  They tried to push us to do something to 
see how can (we get) the users back and we tried really hard because I know it was a really hard year for us last year. 


 
● CMCM heavily guarded the number of active users, even inside the organization; they were even kept from executives and 


advertising sales staff.  
 


PP: What percentage of the users are active, do you think?...They report 600 million monthly active users, but I’m a 
little bit suspicious about that. 





Former Employee: So that number is heavily, heavily guarded, even inside the organization.  To the point that I will say 
not all executives get to see the real number of active users.  So, when you, like me, work in advertising and are trying 
to sell advertising space, it’s extremely hard to do if you don’t know how many users you have to sell… but I would 
suspect it’s significantly lower than that (600 million) 


 
● Most, if not all, of the advertising sales team in the US had recently left over an approximately 18-month timeframe because they 


were struggling to sign new business.  (Note: Given how much the sales team was struggling, we think CMCM’s reporting of 
growing utility revenues makes little sense.) 


 
Former Employee: Look at advertising sales in the US for example, I think you can probably go on LinkedIn and look at 
everybody who was part of the US advertising sales team and you’ve realized that over the past 18 months everybody’s 
left.  So, it’s a pretty good sign that sales are not working if you have sales people leaving because sales people stay 
as long as they pay commission, so if they can’t make commission they leave, right. 


 
● Often times numbers would be circulated internally that appeared to be inaccurate. (Note: his statement reflects very poorly on 


the company’s financial controls.) 
 


PP: When you said that the numbers you calculated did not match what the company was disclosing, can you just be 
more specific? 





Former Employee: On the ad platform we can know everything, which ads are served, what’s the payout for which 
campaign, how many clicks it got, downloads, how much revenue they made every day. But to give you a sense of the 
mess it was - When I joined, if you are looking at the monthly revenue, and if you are taking the daily revenue and 
adding up every daily revenue for the month, it wouldn’t match the monthly revenue.
25 


● Former colleagues who work in CMCM’s advertising department had mentioned that the reported financials were “fake numbers.” 
 


Former Employee (via a translator): These are all things that he has heard from...colleagues that are in the sales & 
marketing department, different departments, advertising department.  From his understanding, these are fake 
numbers. 


(Note: Refer to the Appendix for more complete from conversations with these individuals.) 
 
Based on our analysis, the concerns expressed by these former employees have merit.   
 
 


 CMCM’s Reported Mobile MAUs Appears to be Grossly Overstated 
 
To begin with, our research indicates that the mobile MAUs reported by CMCM are likely fabricated.  From Q2’15 to Q2’17, CMCM reported 
a 17.7% increase in mobile MAUs from 494m to 581m.  However, our custom calculation based on App Annie Intelligence data indicates 
that MAUs of CMCM’s core mobile utility apps declined by 49.9%!  Given that utility apps account for the majority of its mobile MAUs – 
~500m based on an interview of CMCM management – this large increase does not seem possible. 
 
• Our calculations based on App Annie Intelligence data indicate that downloads and MAUs of all of CMCM’s core utility apps have 


fallen off a cliff since peaking in Q2’15. 
 
From Q2’15 to Q2’17,  


o Clean Master downloads declined by 67.6%, and its average MAUs declined by 51.1%. (Note: We calculate based on App 
Annie Intelligence data that Clean Master accounted for approximately 26% of CMCM’s Q2’17 mobile utility MAUs, based on 
~500m total mobile utility MAUs,) 


o CM Security downloads declined by 50.2%, and its average MAUs declined by 36.7%. (Note: We calculate based on App Annie 
Intelligence data that CM Security accounted for ~12% of CMCM’s Q2’17 mobile utility MAUs, based on ~500m total mobile 
utility MAUs. 


(Note: We calculate based on App Annie Intelligence data and ~500m total mobile utility MAUs, that Clean Master and CM Security 
together accounted for ~38% of CMCM’s Q2’17 mobile utility MAUs.)
26 


In fact, over the same period, the trend is just as bad for almost all of CMCM’s other core utility apps.  
 





• Given the sharp decline in utility users, CMCM appears to have fabricated the reported increase in mobile MAUs: Following on the 
above analysis, we estimate that on the whole, the average MAUs of CMCM’s core mobile utility apps declined 49.9% from Q2’15 to 
Q2’17!  During that same time period, CMCM inexplicably reported a 17.7% increase in its mobile MAUs: 
 


  
 
• The divergence is too large to be explained by simple rounding error: Our calculations for growth in CMCM core utility MAU based 


on App Annie Intelligence estimates should be a close approximation of the company’s reality. According to representatives from App 
Annie, mobile app MAU data reported on App Annie is very accurate, particularly for top-ranked apps.
27 


 
As an example, she indicated that App Annie’s estimates for Snapchat’s (SNAP) QoQ MAU growth has been 99% correlated to actuals 
since 2014: AA MAUs are .99 correlated when comparing QoQ growth against Snap's DAU metric since 2014.  She also indicated that 
App Annie’s estimates for Twitter’s (TWTR) YoY MAU growth have landed within 0%-2% of actuals for the past six quarters: 





Since TWTR only reports total MAUs and not mobile MAUs, it is important to look at the consistent trends in our 
dataset. We have found that dividing the YoY AA MAU growth rates by 2 is the best way to normalize for the substantial 
mobile growth that has taken place. By dividing by 2, AA MAU growth rates have landed within 0-2% of actual YoY 
growth rates in the past 6 quarters. 


We believe the mobile MAUs reported by CMCM are grossly inflated. 
 
  


 CMCM’s Reported Mobile Utility Revenue Also Appears to Be Grossly Overstated 
 
From Q2’15 to Q2’17, CMCM’s utility revenue from its mobile apps grew 35.9% from $81.0m to $110.1m, based on our estimates.  We 
believe this growth is not possible given the severe headwinds the Company’s core mobile utility apps have run into over the past two 
years.  Thus, we believe CMCM has also fabricated its mobile utility revenue. 
 
• MAUs of mobile utility apps have dropped precipitously over the past two years: As just detailed, we estimate MAUs of CMCM’s 


core mobile utility apps to have declined 49.9% over the past two years.  Given that almost half of the Company’s mobile utility MAUs 
have seemingly disappeared, this should have significantly pressured the Company’s mobile utility revenue. 
 


• Facebook has significantly reduced its business with CMCM: Facebook significantly reduced the amount of CMCM inventory on its 
ad network in early 2016 after discovering that ads placed on CMCM’s utility apps did not perform well.  As a result, CMCM’s revenue 
from Facebook has declined significantly over the past 1.5 years.  Given that Facebook is the Company’s largest customer, this should 
also have placed great pressure on utility revenue.  (More details on Facebook’s decision has been provided in a later section.) 
 


• In the face of severe headwinds, CMCM’s mobile utility revenue has…increased?:  Our research indicates that CMCM’s mobile utility 
revenue has actually increased by 35.9% over the past two years. We do not believe this large increase in mobile utility revenue is 
possible given the severe headwinds outlined above.  Again, if anything, we think CMCM’s mobile utility revenue should have 
decreased significantly.

28 


 Is More Than 57% Of CMCM’s Q2’17 Utility Revenue Fabricated? 
 
To reiterate we believe the evidence suggests CMCM is grossly inflating its mobile utility revenue and by extension, its total utility revenue.  
By applying the historical growth in the Company’s core mobile utility MAUs to its estimated mobile utility revenue, we can ballpark CMCM’s 
‘actual’ total utility revenue: 
 
• Based on its public filings and disclosures, we estimate that CMCM’s mobile utility revenue in Q2’17 was $110.1m: CMCM reported 


that its total utility revenue was $121.0m in Q2’17.  Of this, we estimate $110.1m was from mobile, while $10.9m was from PC: 
 





• We estimate that actual mobile utility revenue in Q2’17 was $40.6m: CMCM’s reported mobile marketing services revenue was 
$81.0m in Q2’15.  Thus, we estimate that the Company’s mobile utility revenue in Q2’15 was also $81.0m. 
 
From Q2’15 to Q2’17, we estimate the MAUs of CMCM’s core mobile utility apps decreased by 49.9%.  We make the simplifying 
assumption this should have translated into a corresponding, equivalent decline in revenue, thereby estimating that the Company’s 
actual mobile utility revenue was $40.6m in Q2’17:
29 


• Prescience Point estimates that more than 57% of CMCM’s reported utility revenue in Q2’17 was fabricated: Adding $40.6m of est 
mobile utility revenue to $10.9m of est PC utility revenue, we calculate that total utility revenue was $51.5m in Q2’17.   Thus, we 
estimate that CMCM overstated its utility revenue in Q2’17 by $69.5m or $277.9m annualized.
30 


Glaring Red Flags in CMCM’s Financial Reports?  
 
All roads lead to the same destination:  
 
Our assessment of CMCM’s business lines initially led us to conclude it is fabricating its reported revenue and its financial reports cannot 
be relied upon. Had our research instead begun with the Company’s financial statements, we would have arrived at the same conclusion: 
Cheetah’s SEC financial reports cannot be trusted.   
 
Note: In the below analyses we use the term “cash balance” to represent the summation of Cash & Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Short-
term Investments account balances (i.e., cash balance = Cash & Equivalents + Restricted Cash + Short-term Investments). 
 
 


 Did CMCM Fabricate Its Cash Balance, And Is It Actually Running Out of Cash? 
 
At the end of Q2’17, CMCM’s reported cash balance stood at $351.5m. However, numerous red flags in CMCM’s financial statements in 
our view suggest that CMCM’s cash balance is (1) grossly inflated, and (2) quickly shrinking: 
 
• Large decline in interest income despite a rising cash balance: In FY’14, CMCM’s average cash balance was $177.9m, and it generated 


interest income of $4.5m.  In 1H’17, CMCM’s average cash balance was $315.5m, and it generated interest income of only $1.5m, on 
an annualized basis. In other words, during a time period over which CMCM’s average cash balance grew over 75%, its annualized 
interest income contracted 67.7%! CMCM’s interest income declined dramatically over a period its average cash balance rose equally 
as dramatically, which would make sense if its cash balance were falsified.   





• Increasing reliance on debt further confirms that CMCM’s cash balance cannot be trusted and it is running out of cash, in our view: 
Despite purportedly having a $351.5m cash balance, CMCM is borrowing significant amounts of cash; further, per the table below, 
since going public in the US in May 2014, its debt load has grown year-after-year. As of the end of Q2’17, CMCM had a total of $70.5m 
of debt outstanding.  CMCM is exhibiting an increasing reliance on debt at a time it claims to be flush with cash, which would make 
sense if its cash balance was falsified.     


 
 
• Is CMCM blatantly concealing from investors its growing interest expense and dwindling interest income to avert scrutiny of a 


falsified cash balance? CMCM has an “interest expense, net” line item on its income statement, but guess what? It doesn’t net interest 
income and interest expense. As a matter of fact, its growing interest expense is nowhere to be found on CMCM’s income statement.

Here is a snapshot of CMCM’s FY’16 income statement:  
 


 
 
Per CMCM’s FY’16 20-F, as highlighted in the below disclosure, total interest income in FY’16 was $1.1m while total interest expense 
was also $1.1m.  Thus, the $1.1m of “interest income, net” in FY’16 that the Company reported excludes interest expense. 
 


We generated interest income of RMB28.2 million, RMB14.6 million, and RMB7.8 million (US$1.1 million), and 
interest expense of nil, RMB0.5 million and RMB7.9 million (US$1.1 million), for the years ended December 31, 2014, 
2015 and 2016, respectively.  (FY’16 20-F) 


 
During an interview, management seemed to misdirect, stating that interest income and expense are indeed netted in ‘interest 
expense, net’ – (but it’s not.)   
 


You’re saying that the interest income that you’re showing on your income statement is net of the interest expense? 
 
CMCM: It’s net numbers.  I think we put the ‘net’ there. 
 
So, it’s interest income plus interest expense is what you’re saying? 
 
CMCM: Yes. 


 
So why would CMCM mislead investors into believing that reported interest income is net of interest expense? And why wouldn’t 
CMCM net the two in ‘interest income, net’? Certainly, given CMCM’s growing debt balance – and hence, growing interest expense –  
and shrinking interest income, doing so would make very apparent the collapse in spread between interest income and interest 
expense… Is this another effort to avert scrutiny of a suspect cash balance? 
 


 
 Capital Expenditures Are Suspiciously Low for a High-Growth Tech Company  


 
CMCM shares another red flag associated with a multitude of proven Chinese frauds, specifically fraudulent Chinese technology companies 
- It spends an unusually small amount on capital expenditures. 
 



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597835/000110465917026157/a16-23153_120f.htm
32 


For example, Longtop Financial, a US-listed Chinese software company, was exposed as a massive fraud in 2011.  Whistleblowers pointed 
to Longtop’s low capital expenditures relative to its revenue as a red flag that its books were cooked. 
 
From FY’14 to FY’16, CMCM grew its revenue by 131% from $284.2m to $657.4m.  During that same time period, CMCM spent very little 
on incremental capex to support this growth.  The Company spent just $9.4m (1.7% of revenue) and $10.7m (1.6% of revenue) in FY’15 and 
FY’16, respectively, on property and equipment.  Due to its minimal equipment purchases, CMCM owned just $18.4m of gross computer 
equipment at the end of FY’16. 
 
High-growth technology companies typically need to spend a significant amount on computer equipment, servers, etc. as their user base 
and headcount expands.  Yet, despite growing its revenue more than 130% in just two years, CMCM has not invested much in fixed assets.  
 
A comparison of CMCM to a group of legitimate US-listed Chinese technology companies further illustrates why this does not add up: 
 


  
 
We have serious doubts that CMCM could more than double its revenue without making significant capital investments.  In our view, this 
unusual discrepancy supports our conclusion that CMCM has grossly fabricated its reported revenue. 
 
 


 Did a Baseless Decline in Share Based Comp Account for >90% of Q2’17 Earnings?! 
 
Aside from our opinion that CMCM’s revenue and cash balance are fabricated, we also believe reductions in its share based comp expenses 
were largely fabricated, with the effect of inflating CMCM’s earnings: 
 
• CMCM’s share-based compensation has declined substantially YoY: CMCM’s share-based compensation has declined an unusually 


large amount over the span of just twelve months.  From Q2’16 to Q2’17, CMCM reported a $9.7m or 72.9% decrease (or 72.7% 
decrease based on RMB) in share-based compensation from $13.3m to $3.6m.  Annualized, this represents a decrease of $38.8m.

• The large decline in share-based compensation was attributed to an increase in forfeiture rates: In its Q1’17 earnings report, CMCM 
stated that the decrease in share-based compensation was primarily attributable to an increase in the estimated forfeiture rates of 
share-based awards. 
 


Share-based compensation expenses decreased by 73.4% year over year and 55.0% quarter over quarter to RMB24.4 
million (US$3.5 million) in the first quarter of 2017, mainly due to the change in the estimated forfeiture rates of 
share-based compensation.  (Q1’17 Earnings Report) 


 
Curiously, in its Q2’17 earnings report, CMCM removed the disclosure about its forfeiture rates increasing.  However, we’ll use 
common sense and assume that the decrease in Q2’17 share-based compensation was also attributable to an increase in forfeiture 
rates. 


 
Per CMCM’s FY’16 20-F, forfeiture rates of share-based awards are estimated based on historical and future expectations of employee 
turnover rates: 
 


Forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical experience and future expectations of employee turnover rates and 
are periodically reviewed… Share-based compensation expense is recorded net of estimated forfeitures such that 
expense is recorded only for those share-based awards that are expected to vest. (FY’16 20-F) 


 
 
• Forfeiture rates increased by an estimated 5.4x, we estimate:  In its 2016 20-F, CMCM reported that there was $13.9m of 


unrecognized share-based compensation under its 2013 share incentive plan.  The Company expected this expense to be recognized 
over 1.94 years: 


 
As of December 31, 2016, there was RMB96,350 (US$13,877) of total unrecognized share-based compensation 
expenses related to non-vested restricted shares with an option feature and the cost is expected to be recognized over 
a weighted average period of 1.94 years. Total estimation share-based compensation expenses may be adjusted for 
future changes in estimated forfeitures.  (FY’16 20-F)  


 
The 2016 20-F also included the following summary of restricted shares granted under the 2013 share incentive plan: 








As highlighted above, only 4.3m restricted shares under the 2013 plan were forfeited by employees in FY’16.  This represents just 
6.9% of the 61.3m of total restricted shares outstanding under this plan.   
 
Based on the 72.9% reduction in share-based compensation in Q2’17, we estimate that close to 73% of the remaining ~49.0m 
shares outstanding are projected to be forfeited in 1.94 years; accordingly, the annual forfeiture rate is projected to increase more 
than 5.4x from 6.9% to 37.6% (73% ÷ 1.94 years)! 


 
• We think its unlikely turnover increased enough to warrant such a large increase in forfeiture rates: We understand that turnover 


can fluctuate higher or lower depending on business conditions.  However, we find it unlikely that CMCM’s turnover increased enough 
in just twelve months to warrant an estimated 5.4x increase in forfeiture rates.

34 


 
The majority of CMCM’s outstanding restricted shares are held by key executives and board members of the Company.  From Q4’15 
to Q1’17, it appears that there was not a significant amount of executive or board turnover, based on our review of CMCM’s press 
releases and SEC filings.  There were a couple recent, notable departures – former CFO Ka Wai Andy Yeung and former Senior VP Yong 
Chen – but their departures occurred at the end of Q1’17 (3/31/2017) and end of Q2’17 (6/30/2017), respectively. 
 
Now, consider that the decline in CMCM’s share-based compensation occurred in the periods prior to Q2’17 – From Q4’15 to Q1’17, 
share-based compensation declined by 77.0% from $15.2m to $3.5m.  However, as we just noted, there does not appear to have been 
an unusual amount of executive and board turnover during that time period.  Thus, we believe the large increase in forfeiture rates 
and large decline in share-based compensation reported by CMCM is fiction.  
 


• Prescience Point estimates that CMCM’s Q2’17 share-based compensation was understated by $9.7m (representing 93.3% of Q2’17 
earnings): We believe CMCM’s Q2’17 share-based compensation is a fabrication with the effect of inflating earnings, and that it is 
valid to assume this line-item should have been closer to that reported in Q2’16 – $13.3m.  Therefore, we estimate that CMCM’s 
reported share-based compensation in Q2’17 was understated by $9.7m.  This represents 93.3% of CMCM’s reported Q2’17 earnings 
of $10.4m. 
 





 Other Financial Reporting Red Flags 
 
But wait…there’s more.  Provided below are additional red flags we identified which further indicate that the Company’s financial 
statements cannot be trusted.  
 
• Did CMCM violate GAAP by completely excluding interest expense from its income statement? Our research indicates that CMCM 


has excluded interest expense not only from “Interest income, net” but potentially from the entire income statement – a clear violation 
of GAAP.  Consider once again the following snapshot of CMCM’s FY’16 income statement: 
 





PP Estimate Of 'True' Share-Based Compensation In Q2'17

Sources: PP estimates, CMCM filings with the SEC.

35 


 
As highlighted above, besides “Interest income, net,” it appears that “Other income, net” is the only other line item in CMCM’s FY’16 
income statement that could possibly include interest expense.  However, according to the description of “Other income, net” from 
the Company’s FY’16 20-F, this line item consists primarily of gains on investment disposals, as well as gains or losses on disposal of 
PP&E and intangible assets.  No mention is made of interest expense: 
 


Other income consists primarily of gain on disposal of certain investments, as well as gain or loss on disposal of 
property and equipment and intangible assets.  (FY’16 20-F) 


 
The only place where interest expense appears to be included in CMCM’s FY’16 financial statements is as an obscure footnote to its 
cash flow statement: 
 





• CMCM has changed its reportable business segments in each of the last two quarters! Prior to Q1’17, CMCM reported its revenue 
on a by-service basis in three segments – online marketing services, internet value-added services and internet security services and 
others: 
 


 
 
 
In Q1’17, CMCM changed its revenue reporting to be on a by-product rather than a by-service basis.  As such, it reorganized its revenue 
into four new business segments – utility products and related services, content driven products, mobile game and others: 
 





 
 
Despite having just changed its reportable business segments in Q1’17, CMCM curiously decided to change its business segments 
again in Q2’17.  This time, it combined its content driven products and mobile game segments into a single segment called “mobile 
entertainment”: 
 



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1597835/000110465917026157/a16-23153_120f.htm
36 


 
 
The fact that CMCM once again reorganized its business segments after just doing so in the prior quarter is a significant red flag.  We 
believe the Company made its most recent change in order to obfuscate the performance of its individual business lines. 
 
By combining content driven products and mobile game revenue into a single segment, it has become more difficult for investors to 
gauge the performance of Live.me, a unit for which we believe more than 90% of the revenue is fabricated.

CMCM’s Auditor E&Y Hua Ming – Former Auditor of Sino-Forest & Other Chinese Frauds 
 


In light of the body of evidence we believe indicates CMCM is misrepresenting its financial performance and fabricating its financial 
statements, we were amazed it passed its audits. After we looked into CMCM’s auditor, we were no longer amazed; frankly, we grew more 
confident that CMCM’s financial statements cannot be trusted.  
 
CMCM’s auditor is Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP: 
 


• E&Y Hua Ming has been the auditor of record for several high-profile China frauds: Over the years, E&Y Hua Ming has blessed 
the books of several fraudulent Chinese companies, some of the most notable of which are listed below.  Given E&Y Hua Ming’s 
seemingly poor track record in identifying past frauds, it is not surprising that the firm appears to have completely whiffed on 
identifying the multitude of financial red flags we identified in this report.   


  
o Sino-Forest: At its peak, Sino-Forest had a market cap of $6B.  Its downfall was triggered in June 2011 by a short seller 


report which accused the company of being a “near total fraud.”  The company eventually filed for bankruptcy protection 
and was delisted in early 2012.  According to the Ontario Securities Commission's (“OSC”) 7/14/2017 ruling, the company 
used fictitious transactions to falsify its revenue and inflate its assets. 


o SinoTech Energy: SinoTech went public on the Nasdaq in November 2010, raising $167.8m from investors.  Its downfall 
was triggered in August 2011 by a short seller report which accused the company of using empty shell entities to inflate 
its financial performance.  The company was formally delisted in January 2012.  In April 2012, the SEC sued the Chairman 
of SinoTech for misappropriating company cash, and Sinotech for falsifying asset value.  


o China Agritech: China Agritech went public on the Nasdaq via a reverse merger.  Its downfall was triggered by a series of 
short seller reports in early 2011 which concluded that the company’s financial statements were fraudulent, its purported 
revenue was overstated and its plants were idle.  The company was formally delisted in May 2011. 


o Standard Water: E&Y Hong Kong was the signing accountant for Standard Water but outsourced almost all of the audit 
work to Ernst & Young Hua Ming, its mainland affiliate.  Standard Water applied for a listing on the Hong Kong Stock 
Exchange in November 2009.  However, in March 2010, E&Y resigned as the company’s auditor after discovering 
inconsistencies in the company’s documentation, and Standard Water withdrew its listing application. 


 
• E&Y Hua Ming has been subjected to penalties and other enforcement actions due to its alleged failings as an auditor: For 


example, in September 2014, the firm agreed to pay the OSC an $8m penalty without any admission of wrongdoing to resolve 
allegations that it performed negligent work in its audits of Sino-Forest.  The firm also changed its internal policies on emerging 
markets and agreed to cooperate with the Sino-Forest fraud investigation.  As another example, in February 2015, the firm agreed 
to pay the SEC $500K for refusing to produce documents related to investigations of potential fraud.  The SEC also imposed a 
requirement that the firm must perform specific steps to satisfy future SEC requests for similar materials. 
 


• The seemingly poor reputation of auditors located in mainland China is another point of concern:  Adding further to our 
concerns over the quality of E&Y Hua Ming’s audit work is its location in mainland China.  According to a May 2013 South China 
Morning Post article, auditors in mainland China, even those affiliated with Big 4 audit firms, are generally not very well-regarded 
due to a lack of confidence in the mainland’s legal system and ethical standards: 
 


Imagine there are two new listings with largely identical businesses. Company A has its report signed off by a Hong 
Kong arm of a Big Four accountancy. Company B's is signed by the accountancy's mainland joint venture. Where will 
you put your money? 


 



http://www.scmp.com/business/article/1240178/eys-outsourced-auditing-raises-eyebrows-court
38 


Most of you will say Company A, given the lack of confidence in the mainland's legal system and professional ethics. 


 
An older article published in the NY Times in December 2009 expressed similar sentiments: 
 


Mainland accounting firms that prepare reports under Chinese standards charge about one-third what their Hong 
Kong counterparts do, making them more attractive in terms of price. 


But any cost gains could easily be offset by an industry where book-cooking scandals were so common less than a 
decade ago that they led a former prime minister, Zhu Rongji, to call fraudulent accounting a “malignant tumor” that 
threatened the country’s economy.

Many Other Aspects of CMCM’s Business Appear to be a Sham 
 
Aside from the plethora of red flags already discussed, based on our analysis and conversations with several former employees, many other 
aspects of the Company’s business are highly questionable.  
 


 Former Employees Claim CMCM Has Used Fake Accounts to Generate Illegitimate Revenue From its 
Utility Clients  


 
Based on our conversations with former employees, CMCM has extensively used bots and click farms to generate fake accounts, which are 
used to create fake ad impressions. We were also told that Facebook’s decision to reduce its business with CMCM was made because it 
discovered that a large portion of the utility traffic was fake.  Thus, it appears that a significant portion of whatever real revenue the utility 
business is receiving has been generated through questionable if not illegitimate means. 
 
As we discussed earlier, in early 2016, Facebook decided to significantly reduce the amount of CMCM inventory on its ad network.  In a 
May 2016 Wall Street Journal article, it was explained that Facebook made this decision after discovering that ads on the Company’s utility 
apps did not perform well: 


 
Last October, Facebook tweaked algorithms to give advertisers a metric on how ads perform on third-party publishers. 
Ads on Cheetah’s platform didn’t do well, and revenue was hit. Separately, Facebook has tightened policies that have 
hurt Cheetah’s ability to direct its own advertising clients onto Facebook, says Morgan Stanley.  (Facebook Tweaks 
Algorithm, Tripping Cheetah Mobile, Wall Street Journal, 5/22/16) 


 
Based on our research, the above does not represent the full story of what happened.  We spoke with a former employee who had worked 
on CMCM’s utility apps.  This individual suggested that the basis for Facebook’s decision was that it discovered a substantial portion of the 
ad impressions on CMCM’s utility apps were generated from fake accounts: 
 


Former Employee (via a translator): He had indicated that Cheetah had bought a lot of these (utility app) users, that 
there was a large number of these users that were first purchased by Cheetah Mobile and this is obviously not a long-
term strategy.  The revenue comes from these fake users being able to push advertising content and having fake 
engagement essentially.  (So) He had indicated that all the users were really fake. 
 
Former Employee (via a translator): He’s indicating a usage of click farms as a way to generate revenue on behalf of 
them.  So they have an advertising department then they’ll purchase a click farm to essentially advertise for them on 
this.  And then they’ll go through that to continuously generate revenue as far as from the advertising perspective 
goes. 
 
PP: Oh okay, so the click farms actually generate the impressions?  Is that what you’re saying? 
 
Former Employee (via a translator): (He indicated that) Yes, the click farms generate the impressions. 
 
Former Employee (via a translator): He said that Facebook did in fact notice that a lot of the users were fake, so when 
they went to renegotiate the contract after about a year, they had negotiated the price a lot lower, just knowing that 
the Cheetah Mobile users were fake, and obviously their impressions weren’t being reached as highly. 
 
He indicated that he had a Taiwanese colleague that went to Facebook to negotiate with them and eventually they 
had brought the price down quite considerably. 


 
We interviewed another former employee who had worked in CMCM’s advertising department.  This individual also suggested that 
Facebook reduced the amount of CMCM inventory on its ad network after discovering a large portion of the utility users were fake accounts:  


 



https://www.wsj.com/articles/facebook-tweaks-algorithm-tripping-cheetah-mobile-1463738919
40 


Former Employee: Facebook got a little bit wiser in their analysis of the quality of the traffic, so not just initial actions 
like a click on an ad, but also what happened after an ad was clicked on.  Did the user engage with the product, 
download it, etc, and they realized the quality was really not good which comes back to this robot question.  And so, 
they dropped Cheetah pretty significantly. 
 
Former Employee: (Cheetah’s) Utility inventory is not that attractive in itself, right...Putting two and two together, if 
you had a lot of users that are robots, those users are not typically very good users to advertise products to. 


 
 A Significant Amount of Live.me’s User Base Appears to Be Fake as Well 


 
When it comes to Live.me, we see more of the same; aside from those fake accounts we believe CMCM uses to inflate its revenue via gift 
cycling, the Company also appears to have setup a large number of other fake accounts, with the effect of artificially boosting Live.me’s 
user count and, thus, creating the false impression that Live.me is more popular than it actually is.  Although we cannot exactly quantify 
the degree to which Live.me’s user base has been inflated with fake accounts, we believe it is significant.  The following provide support 
for our conclusion: 
 
• A suspiciously large number of Live.me accounts have similar user names: During our use of the Live.me app, we discovered that a 


countless number of Live.me accounts have very similar user names, in our view indicating that these are fake accounts whose user 
names are randomly generated from a pool of pre-selected words. 
 
For example, as of October 23rd, 176 accounts on Live.me have user names containing the phrase “snowbunny.”  Provided below is a 
snapshot of some of these accounts: 
 


 
 
As another example, as of October 23rd, 18 accounts on Live.me have user names beginning with “Ice King Lurk”.  In addition to having 
very similar user names, many of these accounts also shared the same profile picture.  Provided below is a snapshot of some of these 
accounts:
41 


 
 
As a final example, as of October 23rd, 103 accounts on Live.me have user names containing the phrases “moneymoe”, “money 
moe”, “moemoney” or “moe money.”    A snapshot of some of the accounts containing the phrase “moneymoe” can be found here. 
 


• In videos posted on YouTube, Live.me broadcasters noted that numerous users on the app appeared to be fake: Several Live.me 
broadcasters claimed in videos posted on YouTube (found here, here and here) that a large portion of the users watching live streams 
on the app were fake accounts (i.e. bots) we assume to be controlled and created by CMCM.  A snapshot from one of these videos is 
provided below:

• On Facebook, another Live.me user expressed concern over the seemingly large number of fake accounts on the app: In a Facebook 
comment (which was also posted previously in this article), another Live.me user expressed concern over the seemingly rampant 
presence of fake accounts or in his/her words ‘viewbots’, which “spam the same generic post”: 
 





• Top Live.me broadcasters have relatively few social media followers, further indicating that a large portion of Live.me users are 
fake: Despite having hundreds of thousands and in some cases over a million followers on Live.me, most of Live.me’s top 5 
broadcasters as of the date of our analysis (8.7.2017) have very few followers on social media sites like Instagram and Twitter (as was 
noted earlier). 
 
For example, the top 5 ranked broadcasters on Live.me have a cumulative total of 3.4m fans on Live.me, yet have only 54.5K and 
122.4K Twitter and Instagram followers, respectively.  In our opinion, the most likely explanation for why top Live.me broadcasters 
have so few fans outside the app is that a substantial portion Live.me’s users are fake.

 Flagship Utility Apps, Like Clean Master, Appear to be Functionally Useless 
 
CMCM claims that its utility apps will boost a phone’s performance by cleaning its memory, extending its battery life, protecting against 
security threats, and even cooling its CPU.  Based on the following and other information detailed in this report, we believe these claims 
are bogus. 
 
• CMCM claims that its utility apps will optimize a phone’s performance: by boosting its memory, boosting its battery life, protecting 


it against security threats and even cooling its CPU.  For example, on the Clean Master landing page in the Play store, CMCM touts the 
following features for Clean Master: 


Clean Master helps clean all types of junk files (photo junk, video junk, system junk, advertisement junk, and cache 
junk) to free up storage space. It can also clean junk notifications and free up RAM to improve your phone's speed and 
performance! It gives your phone powerful protection with functions such as Anti-virus and AppLock. 
 
Cools down your phone temperature and reduces CPU usage by stopping apps that cause device overheat. 


 
• According to a couple former employees we interviewed, some of CMCM’s flagship utility apps – including Clean Master – don’t 


function as claimed; instead, they hinder a phone’s performance. 
 
Provided below are the relevant excerpts from our discussions: 
 


Former Employee #1: The problem with the Utility business is that…it’s non-engaged users, so users are not even happy 
with the product.  They’re not using it.  They don’t want it.  When they open the app, they’re always frustrated with 
it. 
 
Former Employee #2: Essentially if you use like Battery Booster or Clean Master, it doesn’t do anything actually.  It’s 
more of a placebo than anything because it doesn’t have the permissions to do anything. 
 
Especially those battery boosting utilities, they are actually detrimental to your battery because they are always 
running, always killing those applications that actually are just restarting immediately right after.  So, it actually makes 
your battery run out faster.  You can find reviews on the Internet. 


 
• Numerous recent trade publications (e.g., here, here, and here) have voiced similar concerns about CMCM’s utility apps. 


 
For example, in a June 2016 MakeUseOf article titled “Do Not Install These 10 Popular Android Apps,” two of the ten apps listed in 
this article were CMCM utility apps - Clean Master and QuickPic: 
 


What it is: (Clean Master is) Another insanely popular “speed booster, battery saver, and phone optimizer”. It has 600 
million users and 26 million five-star reviews. 
 
Why it’s bad: Firstly, it’s made by Cheetah Mobile. We referred to them earlier – the company is renowned for packing 
ads, bloatware, and nag screens into their apps. Secondly, it doesn’t do anything useful... 
 
What it is: QuickPic used to be a friendly and easy-to-use photo gallery. It was never flashy, but clear communications 
and frequent updates saw it steadily grow a well-sized user base. 
 
Why it’s bad: It (QuickPic) was bought by Cheetah Mobile last year. The company immediately started uploading users’ 
data to their own servers, as evidenced by one Google Plus user who found a raft of new DNS requests that were 
attributable to the app.

As another example, in an August 2015 AndroidPolice article, the author had some less than flattering things to say about CMCM: 
 


If you're unfamiliar with Cheetah Mobile, they're one of those developers that create the apps that you end up having 
to remove from your family members' phones at Thanksgiving when they ask why it sucks so much now.  They've 
created dozens and dozens of apps…all of which are free and dripping with adware. 
 
Many of the apps that they provide are duplicates of features already installed on your phone… 
 
They also publish apps that are more or less entirely useless, including multiple "virus scanners," "battery boosters," 
"game boosters," and the like. 


 
• According to one trade publication, even CMCM reps could not demonstrate that Clean Master worked as advertised: In a series 


of articles in published in June 2016 and July 2016 by AndroidPit, the author reported about his interviews with Clean Master 
representatives.  In his interviews, he asked the CMCM reps to demonstrate that Clean Master’s claimed features, such as 
performance boosting and CPU cooling, are beneficial and actually work; he relates that even they could not! 
 


He installed the Facebook app and showed me how it performed before and after using Clean Master's boost function. 
I didn't see a difference in speed and said it looked just the same as before.  (We Interviewed Cheetah Mobile to Ask If 
Clean Master Actually Works, AndroidPit, 6/21/16) 
 
I had concerns about the 'CPU Cooler' function of the app. Clean Master claims it can cool down your smartphone to 
prevent the processor overheating. I said modern smartphones don't overheat (with some exceptions) and that it's not 
necessary to have this.  (We Interviewed Cheetah Mobile to Ask If Clean Master Actually Works, AndroidPit, 6/21/16) 
 
...it's still concerning that they have been unable to show me the app working as it's intended...This is the second time 
that I've spoken to Clean Master representatives in person about the product: how hard can it be? If I had a phone 
with my app installed and somebody asked me to show them how it works, I would just show them.  (Clean Master: 
You Have a Right to Complain, AndroidPit, 7/29/16) 


 
• Reviews from actual users are also generally very poor, based on our browsing of several Android-related message boards.  


 
Provided below are a couple of these postings:  
 


As has been covered here before, anything by Cheetah Mobile has been known for quite a while to be not only basically 
functionally worthless, but just plain evil. Hijacks your device, throws up nag ads and false alarms, and phones home 
with your data to numerous servers in China. Many, many warnings about avoiding Cheetah Mobile have been posted 
here and in numerous other places.  (AndroidCentral Forums) 
 
Cheetah Mobile makes a bunch of ad-filled crapware with suspicious ratings like "Battery Saver" and "Speed Booster" 
and generally anything they touch turns to sh*t so you can see why this might end up being a problem.  (Reddit) 
  
 


 CMCM has Used Deceptive Tactics to Acquire Real Users for Potentially Useless Apps 
 
Assuming as we have that CMCM’s utility apps are indeed useless, it is little wonder then the Company has resorted to deceptive tactics in 
an attempt to acquire real users for its (useless) utility apps.  These include the following: 
 
• Misleading and/or malicious advertisements: For several years, CMCM has used misleading/malicious ads, in our view to trick users 


into installing its products.  In fact, in 2014, Clean Master was temporarily banned from the Play Store for its misleading advertisements 
which encouraged users to uninstall Google Chrome and replace it with CMCM's browser.  The following is an excerpt from an August 
2015 South China Morning Post article:

In July 2014, Google removed Clean Master from its rankings list due to a violation of Google Play’s policies. The 
company was accused of encouraging users to uninstall competitors’ browsers and replacing them with its own. 


 
The Company’s use of such ads continued even after being temporarily banned from the Play Store.  AndroidPit took the Company to 
task on this matter during its interviews with Clean Master representatives last year.  In the June 2016 and July 2016 articles that we 
referenced previously, AndroidPit noted the following: 
 


Functionality aside, another concern the Android community has regarding Clean Master is its advertising.  (Clean 
Master: You Have a Right to Complain, AndroidPit, 7/29/16) 
 
The Clean Master app warned me of "monetary loss" and recommended I install the CM Security app (another Cheetah 
Mobile product) to fix this. Apps at risk included Chrome and other seemingly safe products.  (We Interviewed Cheetah 
Mobile to Ask If Clean Master Actually Works, AndroidPit, 6/21/16) 
 
I followed up by showing Shih and Ting a message from the Clean Master app. “It says ‘intruder alert, someone tried 
to snoop on your phone!’”...I asked again why the app is telling me something that is untrue.  (Clean Master: You Have 
a Right to Complain, AndroidPit, 7/29/16)  


 
AndroidPit also provided the following picture of what is clearly a misleading ad designed to scare the user into installing a CMCM 
app: 
 


 
 
• Forced installations: According to a former employee, CMCM has used a highly questionable tactic known as cross-selling in order to 


boost the downloads of its utility apps.  The author of a May 2015 Seeking Alpha article referenced this tactic in his comments about 
the Company: 
 


Cheetah had five apps among the top-30 non-game apps on Google Play in March and has been able to successfully 
cross-sell these apps with a high frequency of use. 


 
So, what exactly is cross-selling?  Cross-selling refers to the forced installation of an app on your phone.  Hypothetically speaking for 
example, were a user to install an app like Clean Master, it will automatically download and install another CMCM app – which would 
be reprehensible, in our view.   
 
A former CMCM employee explained the “strategy” to us: 
 



https://seekingalpha.com/article/3215816-cheetah-mobile-has-more-room-to-run
46 


Former Employee: What I mean by up-selling and cross-selling, sometimes they will force your phone to download a 
new app because you have one of them.  So, say you open Clean Master and then automatically it downloads CM 
Launcher in the background and you’re not even aware of it. 
 
PP: Okay, is that even legal? 
 
Former Employee: It’s borderline. 


 
• Fake Reviews: Finally, CMCM has been accused on many occasions of using fake reviews to artificially boost the rankings of its apps.  


Based on our negative perception of CMCM and its applications, we assume these accusations to have merit. 
 
In the same AndroidPolice article posted earlier, the following was noted about the suspiciously high ratings of the Company’s apps: 
 


We can't legally say that Cheetah Mobile floods all of its apps with fake downloads and five-star reviews, but we can 
sure as hell imply it. 
 
Clean Master Boost & AppLock" has over 500 million downloads...and its distribution of reviews shows some clearly 
sketchy behavior skewing the Play Store rating. 


 
Many Android users have also expressed their skepticism on various message boards.  For example: 
 


Also, I'm beginning to think Cheetah Mobile pays people to rate their apps highly. 4.7 stars with millions of installs is 
crazy. Not only that, but every time I One Star the app and leave a negative review, I come back a week later to see it 
has been modified to a 5 Star rating when I first rated it years ago. WTF? I've put a negative review more than once 
on Clean Master and every time I come back, it's gone.  (Reddit)

Is CMCM On the Verge of Imploding? 
 
To state the obvious, a business that has acted in as troubling of a manner as CMCM appears to have is not a sustainable one.  That CMCM 
has been able to survive for this long, especially as a US-listed public company, is quite remarkable in our view.  However, recent 
developments suggest that the Company’s luck may be running out. 
 
As will be discussed in this section, CMCM is the subject of an active, undisclosed SEC investigation as confirmed by responses to our recent 
FOIA requests; its real revenue appears to be rapidly diminishing due to a growing focus by its top clients, like Facebook, on cracking down 
on fake ad traffic; some of its key executives – including its US-trained CFO – have recently and suddenly departed; and its insiders have 
been rampantly registering their shares for sale via Form 144 filings.  All of this leads us to believe that CMCM may be on the verge of 
imploding.   
 


 FOIA Requests Reveal CMCM Is the Subject of An Ongoing, Undisclosed SEC Investigation   
 
In response to our FOIA requests to the SEC, we received information that confirms CMCM is the subject of an active, undisclosed SEC 
Enforcement Division investigation. In light of the evidence presented in this report, which in our view indicates gross malfeasance, we 
expect this investigation to eventually result in severe enforcement against the Company and its management team. We have submitted 
the results of our investigation to the SEC via whistleblower complaint.  
 
In a letter dated July 24, 2017, the FOIA office denied our request for access to CMCM’s investigative records by invoking Exemption 
(b)(7)(A) of the FOIA. Citation of the (b)(7)(A) exemption means that the SEC deems the release of information it has collected on CMCM 
could be expected to interfere with an ongoing investigation. 


 
An excerpt from the first page of the FOIA office’s response letter is provided below:
48 


 
Again, by invoking Exemption (b)(7)(A), the SEC has effectively acknowledged that CMCM is the subject of an ongoing SEC investigation as 
of the date of their response. Per the Department of Justice: 


 
The first subpart of Exemption 7 of the Freedom of Information Act, Exemption 7, authorizes the withholding of 
'records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that production of such law 
enforcement records or information . . . could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings. 


 
For further confirmation of the existence of an investigation, we sent an administrative appeal to the General Counsel’s office. In its 
response, the General Counsel’s office denied our access to CMCM’s records by once again invoking Exemption (b)(7)(A), stating that 
releasing investigative records on CMCM could “interfere with ongoing enforcement proceedings.” By doing so, the General Counsel’s 
office has confirmed that CMCM is the subject of an active SEC investigation. 


 
An excerpt from the first page of the General Counsel’s response letter is provided below: 








 
 CMCM’s Real Revenue Appears to be Rapidly Contracting Due to Growing Focus on Eliminating Ad Fraud  


 
Facebook was CMCM’s largest customer in FY’16, accounting for 19.9% of its total reported revenue. Our research indicates that Facebook 
has continued to reduce its business with CMCM in FY’17. Based on the additional reductions that Facebook has made, and a former 
employee’s claims that Facebook knows CMCM ad traffic is “fake”, we think its likely Facebook is in the process of cutting off its business 
with the Company. Furthermore, we believe that the growing industry focus on eliminating ad fraud means that CMCM is at elevated risk 
of having Google and other utility clients follow Facebook’s lead.   Thus, whatever real revenue the utility business is generating will likely 
continue to contract significantly over the coming quarters. 
 



https://www.justice.gov/oip/foia-guide-2004-edition-exemption-7a
49 


We estimate -- after adjusting for our estimates of fabricated utility and Live.me revenue ($69.5m and $36.4m, respectively) -- that more 
than 72% of CMCM’s total revenue in Q2’17 came from the utility business; as such, we find it highly unlikely that CMCM will survive the 
loss of a large portion of its utility revenue. 
 
We derive these research opinions based on the following: 
 
• In FY’17, Facebook has further reduced its business with CMCM:  In FY’17, Facebook has continued to make further significant cuts 


to CMCM inventory on its ad network.  During its Q1’17 earnings call on May 22nd, CMCM management indicated that some of its ad 
formats had been recently discontinued by some of its third party advertising partners: 
 


We expect our revenues from utility products and related services to decrease year-over-year as certain ad formats 
have been recently discontinued by some of our overseas third-party advertising partners. 
 
So, some of our third-party advertising platforms, they decide to discontinue to deliver ads to those type of formats. 
So that will impact us as well. And we will see some other inventory, which now may not be filled up immediately by 
our other advertising platform partners. So that’s what’s happening right now.  (Q1’17 Earnings Call) 


 
We spoke with a former CMCM employee who told us that the third-party advertising partner referred to was Facebook.  This 
individual also indicated that Facebook was trying to cut off its partnership with CMCM. 


 
Former Employee: In our world the way it happens, you don’t just cut a partnership off.  Typically, you make it harder 
for the partner to participate.  So, in this case, effectively they (Facebook) changed the requirement for the advertising 
format.  So, that’s what happened in terms of excluding them (Cheetah) from those advertising opportunities. 


 
• Our research suggests Facebook to soon cut off its business with CMCM: We do not believe that Facebook will continue to place ads 


on CMCM apps when, as we were told by a former employee, it knows a substantial portion of CMCM traffic is “fake”.  Thus, in light 
of the ongoing cutbacks it has been making, we believe it is likely Facebook is in the process of phasing out its business with CMCM.   
 


• Google and potentially other utility clients, who are increasingly focused on eliminating ad fraud, are likely to follow Facebook’s 
lead: Over the past year, the elimination of ad fraud has become an increasingly hot topic of discussion in the online advertising space.  
For example, according to various articles published over the past few months (here, here and here), Google is paying an increasing 
amount of attention on trying to curb online ad fraud.  The following excerpts are from a July 2017 MediaPost article: 
 


Google has been trying to gauge the number of fraudulent ads that run across the advertising ecosystem, and along 
with a few media companies, has been "quietly" running tests to examine the problem, according to one report. 
 
Google is taking the lead on an industry initiative called ads.txt spearheaded by the Interactive Advertising Bureau. 
Ads.txt aims to wipe out fraud known as spoofing and increase transparency in programmatic advertising by keeping 
a public record of the Authorized Digital Sellers of the ads. 


 
Given this increased focus on eliminating ad fraud, and assuming that CMCM is presenting with fake ad impressions, we believe 
CMCM’s other utility clients will follow Facebook’s lead.   
 


• CMCM is unlikely to survive further significant contractions in its utility revenue: We estimate Q2’17 utility revenue was 72% of 
consolidated revenue, after adjusting for our estimates of fabricated utility and Live.me revenue ($69.5m and $36.4m, respectively).  
Given that the utility business accounts for the majority of its actual revenue, CMCM will likely be unable to survive for much longer if 
its utility revenue continues to decline significantly, as we believe it will.

 Recent Executive Departures, Including CMCM’s CFO, And Rampant Insider Sale Registrations Are 
Further Signs of Looming Trouble 


 
As CMCM’s financial condition is deteriorating and the SEC is investigating, key executives are departing the Company and insiders are 
rampantly registering shares for sale via Form 144 filings.  Is this a sign that trouble is looming for CMCM?  We think so. 
 
• Recent departure of key executives is a red flag: On March 31, 2017, Mr. Ka Wai Andy Yeung resigned as CFO of CMCM.  Just a few 


months later, as disclosed in the Company’s Q2’17 earnings report, Mr. Yong Chen resigned as Senior VP effective June 30th. 
 
Of particular concern is the departure of CFO Mr. Yeung.  According to a former CMCM manager, Mr. Yeung was a seasoned, US-
trained executive who was brought in to reassure the US markets of the legitimacy of the Company and its reported financials.  Now, 
with his sudden departure, that seal of approval is gone – Adding further to the already serious doubts over the accuracy of the 
Company’s reported financials. 


Former Employee: Their CFO was a very sophisticated American trained guy, right.  And so he was brought on as a seal 
of approval for the market to perceive…He was the one, I guess, the warranty of Americanism and cleanliness on the 
books, and he brought the big bankers to the deal, etc.  I think he found very different things than (what) he was 
expecting.” 


He was also not politically very well-aligned with Fu Sheng because I think he wasn’t really doing what Fu Sheng 
wanted him to do all the time 


• Insiders appear to be cashing out: A total of 5 insiders have registered their shares for sale via Form 144 filings over the past 5 
months for an estimated total of $17.3m in proceeds, according to CapitalIQ.  This includes an estimated $1.4m of registered stock 
sales by CEO Sheng Fu (via an entity he owns called Fax Vision Corporation) and an estimated $9.7m of registered stock sales by 
President Ming Xu.10 (see Appendix for the source data from CapitalIQ)

Valuation 
 
Given the evidence of gross malfeasance presented in this report, we conclude that CMCM shares are simply uninvestable.  That being 
said, in the interest of being conservative, we have attempted to provide an estimated valuation. 
 
CMCM’s reported Adj. EBITDA was $18.7m in Q2’17.  We estimate that CMCM’s actual Adj. EBITDA in Q2’17 was $3.3m.  We derived our 
Q2’17 EBITDA estimate based on the following key assumptions: 
 


• Revenue: As calculated earlier, we believe actual Q2’17 revenue was $80.4m, rather than the $177.2m CMCM reported. 
• Gross Margin: Assumed to be equivalent to reported Q2’17 gross margin of 61.6%. 
• Operating Expenses: Assumed to be equivalent to reported Q3’14 operating expenses.  We believe this is a reasonable 


assumption given that CMCM’s reported Q3’14 revenue of $78.0m is close to our estimate of its actual Q2’17 revenue of 
$80.4m.     





 
 
We have used the above EBITDA estimate along with reasonable assumptions to value CMCM’s shares: 
 


• Based on its share price of $8.42 as of 10/25/2017, CMCM is currently trading at 17.8x its reported LTM EBITDA of $63.7m (See 
the Appendix for a more detailed calculation). 


• By applying this multiple and a 35% corruption discount to our annualized Q2’17 Adj. EBITDA estimate of $13.3m, CMCM’s 
enterprise value is $153.9m. 


• After applying a 50% corruption discount to CMCM’s Q2’17 cash balance of $351.5m, CMCM’s adjusted cash balance is around 
$175.8m. 


• Adding it all up, we value CMCM’s equity at $1.69 per share.  This represents a discount of 80.0% to the current share price.

But we believe this valuation is likely too generous given the 1) evidence that CMCM has materially misled investors about its financial 
performance, 2) presence of an ongoing SEC investigation into CMCM, and 3) evidence that the Company’s real revenue is contracting 
rapidly and that it is running out of cash.  While we currently value CMCM at $1.69 per share, we expect CMCM shares will eventually 
become worthless and subsequently de-listed from the NYSE due to the issues highlighted in this report.

Estimation of “Reported” Live.me revenue 
 
As previously stated, content revenue consists of revenue from its 
Live.me and News Republic apps. CMCM acquired News Republic 
in early June 2016.  In FY’16, CMCM reported $2.3m of revenue 
from News Republic over a period of approximately eight months.  
Pro-rating this amount over three months, we estimate that 
revenue from News Republic was $0.9m in Q3’16.  Since then, 
based on management comments, revenue from News Republic 
has remained roughly the same.  Thus, in Q2’17, we estimate that 
revenue from News Republic was also $0.9m. 
 
On a call with CMCM management representative and asked her to 
confirm that News Republic accounted for just a small portion of 
Q2’17 content revenue.  She confirmed this was accurate: 
 


CMCM: For our content revenue…the vast majority of the 
content revenue is generated by Live.me.  For News 
Republic, the product itself is still being developed right now. 





PP: About how much revenue does News Republic generate?

● Extracts of our conversation with a former CMCM manager in the utility division: 
 


Former Employee: I don’t exactly know how they make up their number(s), definitely they do something for the public 
financial reports.  People they watch the news and (the news) says “Cheetah Mobile has increased their revenue”.  
(But) every weekly meeting we had, we definitely see the downloads is going down when I was working there...I mean 
they must do something to the numbers. 





There’s definitely something wrong with the company, so that’s why I left. 





They’re going down (downloads) and the impressions are going down too.  They tried to push us to do something to 
see how can (we get) the users back and we tried really hard because I know it was a really hard year for us last year. 





PP: You’re saying that you don’t believe that the financials are accurate that they’re reporting to the public. 
 
Former Employee: No, no.  There must be something.  I mean they make up (the numbers) for sure. 
 


PP: Did your other colleagues say anything about that (the numbers)? 





Former Employee: We are like 80 (to) 90 percent sure that the numbers are fake. 





PP: You’re saying that you and your colleagues were skeptical about the numbers? 





Former Employee: Correct, yeah that’s what we talked about every day when I was there. 





● Extracts of our conversation with another former CMCM manager in the utility division: 
 


Former Employee: It’s a Chinese company, I don’t know how much experience you guys have with Chinese companies.  
You never know exactly what’s going on in there.
56 


PP: One thing that we heard about the company was the senior executive team was very hush hush about numbers 
internally.  So, as an example, one person told us that they didn’t even know what the actual monthly active users 
were for the company because the management team would not share that data with them.  Which was, to us, a very 
big red flag because why would you not share one of your most important metrics with your own advertising team, 
right?  Have you seen any evidence of the company being either misleading about their own numbers internally or 
trying to hide things? 





Former Employee: They are very hush hush about it (the numbers) 





I was managing the advertising platform, so I had access to the numbers, the stats of the platform in real time, and I 
didn’t get the same numbers that they had.  So I don’t know where they were getting their numbers from. 





PP: When you said that the numbers you calculated did not match what the company was disclosing, can you just be 
more specific? 





Former Employee: On the ad platform we can know everything, which ads are served, what’s the payout for which 
campaign, how many clicks it got, downloads, how much revenue they made every day. But to give you a sense of the 
mess it was - When I joined, if you are looking at the monthly revenue, and if you are taking the daily revenue and 
adding up every daily revenue for the month, it wouldn’t match the monthly revenue 





(And) When I would check the monthly revenue from the platform, I wouldn’t get the same number the business had 
on their side, and I was never able to understand the numbers that were published in the financial statements of the 
Company. 





PP: When you look at how far off the numbers were, what’s your assessment of that?  Did you ever think wow these 
numbers are off by xyz percent, or are inflated by 300%?  What are your thoughts on that, like the degree. 





Former Employee: They were sometimes going in different directions.  Sometimes the numbers on my side were going 
down and whereas the business teams, the sales teams were getting lot of pressure to sell more and get the numbers 
back up and at the same time we were reporting growing numbers in the financial statements. 





● Extracts of our conversation with a former CMCM marketing manager: 
 


PP: What percentage of the users are active, do you think?...They report 600 million monthly active users, but I’m a 
little bit suspicious about that.
57 


Former Employee: So that number is heavily, heavily guarded, even inside the organization.  To the point that I will say 
not all executives get to see the real number of active users.  So, when you, like me, work in advertising and are trying 
to sell advertising space, it’s extremely hard to do if you don’t know how many users you have to sell. 





So, I can’t tell you for sure because...most of the teams weren’t given access to the actual active user numbers but I 
would suspect it’s significantly lower than that (600 million)...Some of the most attractive geos (geographies) like US 
and Western Europe are really poor. 





Look at advertising sales in the US for example, I think you can probably go on LinkedIn and look at everybody who 
was part of the US advertising sales team and you’ve realized that over the past 18 months everybody’s left.  So, it’s 
a pretty good sign that sales are not working if you have sales people leaving because sales people stay as long as 
they pay commission, so if they can’t make commission they leave, right. 





PP: Over the last two years revenue has gone up from advertising, but you’re saying that the advertising personnel 
has left, meaning that they’re not actually selling any advertisements.  So, it seems to me that with the decline in 
downloads, with people leaving from the advertising department, I’m calling into question whether their reported 
revenue is real. 





Former Employee: You and me both...I don’t wanna make a snap judgement on it (but)...one of the reasons I left the 
company is there is definitely some fuzzy accounting going on, right.  And clearly partly its sheer incompetence 
financially and partly it probably serves them well, but it’s happened that numbers that were shared internally were 
really far from reality, and there were some very obvious accounting mistakes. 





I would say that I was very surprised that for a American publicly listed company there was such large mistakes in 
accounting. 





PP: (So) Would you agree with my assessment...that their reported revenue for advertising does not make a lot of 
sense relative to the trends in the business. 





Former Employee: Completely. 





I’ve worked with a lot Chinese companies, and I know they do business differently, but Cheetah is a different scale in 
terms of how worried I would be. 





● Extracts of our conversation with a former CMCM software engineer in the utility division:
58 


Former Employee (via a translator): He also wanted to add in one extra thing that he had spoken with a couple 
colleagues he remembers during his time there.  He had spoken with colleagues that were heading to Europe for a 
sales meeting and the numbers weren’t reflecting what they needed as far as the real numbers.  So they had lied to 
say that their ad impressions had increased 10x the amount that it actually was...they published a lot of fake numbers. 





PP: Does he thinks it’s possible or has he seen any evidence of the Company massaging their numbers or fudging their 
numbers? 





Former Employee (via a translator): These are all things that he has heard from...colleagues that are in the sales & 
marketing department, different departments, advertising department.  From his understanding, these are fake 
numbers.  





 
Additional Evidence That Online Marketing Services and Utility Revenue Are Almost Equivalent 
 
In its Q2’17 earnings report, CMCM disclosed that utility products and related services revenue totaled RMB 946.2m in Q2’16.  By 
comparison, online marketing services revenue totaled RMB 939.1m in Q2’16.  Thus, in Q2’16, online marketing services revenue and utility 
revenue were almost the same amount: 
 


 
 
 
 
Recent Online Casting Call is Evidence Suggesting CMCM Hires Broadcasters to Live Stream on Live.me 
 
We present evidence in the form of recently published online casting calls suggesting, as former employees claimed, that CMCM hires its 
own broadcasters.  Given the casting call states that compensation is in the form of a fixed hourly wage and makes no mention of any 
variable component from the receipt of gifts on the platform, we are left to believe CMCM would maintain control over these broadcasters’ 
accounts.

4 2016 20-F 
5 ibid  
6 Per the Q4’16 earnings call, 


Okay. So if you look at our content revenues for Live.me, it’s fully in IVAS, because it’s virtual gift and so you if look at virtual gift, 
it increased – sorry, the IVAS increased quarter-on-quarter mainly coming from the increase in Live.me’s revenue increase.  (Q4’16 
Earnings Call) 


Our researcher spoke with CMCM management: 
Researcher: In your FY’16 20-f you state Live.me rev is classified as IVAS. Based on this is it safe for us to assume that all Live.me revenue is 
virtual gifting? 
 
CMCM: At this stage, yes; correct. All of it is from users buying virtual items and sending those to broadcasters, and then we get a cut. But in 
the future there could be some new business models…the business model is always evolving. There could be some new models being introduced 
on the Live.me platform, but currently 100% of them are through the selling of virtual items 
 
Researcher: When we look at the biz models of your competitors, we see they’re generating far more mobile revenue vs pc revenue.. Is it safe 
for us to assume for our models that 100% of revenue generated is generated via mobile app 


 
CMCM IR: For cheetah, all of the Live.me revenue generated is on the mobile platform, so the mobile app; we have a pc version, but its more for 
people to have another platform to view some of the content.

10 CapitalIQ insider share sales data for CMCM based on hardcopy Form 144 filings provided by the Washington Service.  The data has 
been verified as accurate.  As per the Washington Service, insiders of foreign companies are not required to file a Form 4 but are still 
required to register proposed sales of restricted stock on a Form 144: 
 


In contrast to insiders in U.S. companies, officers and directors of many foreign issuers traded on U.S. stock exchanges are not required to file a 
Form 4. However, they are still required to register proposed sales of restricted stock on a Form 144. Consequently, the 144 is the only source of 
information on insider stock sales in these companies. 
 
In addition, while all insiders who file a Form 144 must also file a Form 4 if they actually sell the restricted stock, not all affiliates are insiders. 
Form 144s may therefore also report significant sales by affiliates that are not disclosed on Form 4s.
