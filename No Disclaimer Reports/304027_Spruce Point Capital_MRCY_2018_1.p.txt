About Spruce Point Capital Management


Absent sufficient explanations from Mercury’s CEO about its connection to the SEWIP cost overrun allegations, and its 
inability to generate free cash flow growth in the past three years while claiming 112% Adj. EBITDA growth, we believe the 


CEO of Mercury should resign, just like its CFO, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer did in Sept 2017 and Feb 2018.

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Believes Mercury Systems 
(Nasdaq: MRCY) Is A “Strong Sell”


Newly Declassified DoD Inspector General Report Validates Problems At SEWIP Block 3, Mercury’s Material Business Program: 
• Three of seven allegations against SEWIP 3 prime Northrop Grumman related to cost overruns have been validated by investigators,


and two other allegations have been partially validated. Material cost overruns may suggest sales overstatement at Mercury
• Mercury talked about SEWIP Block 3 adding >$140m of revenues and that it is a material driver of its results. Mercury has warned that 


the loss of SEWIP would have a Material Adverse Effect on its business. We find material inconsistencies between management 
statements and SEC disclosures on recent SEWIP revenue contributions


• Management enacted a 10b5-1 stock sale program in August 2017 (not disclosed until Oct 2017), ahead of the Inspector General audit 
report in Nov 2017


Mercury appears to be caught in the perfect storm of slowing growth, rising costs and debt. There are multiple material 
adverse changes currently facing Mercury which suggest 50% to 85% downside risk ($7 to $23 per share).


Numerous High Level Signs That Mercury Is Under Extreme Financial Pressures:


• Mercury’s Adj. EBITDA margins of 23.4% are extremely high for a government subcontractor, and have grown 450bps in the last three 
fiscal years, allowing Adj. EBITDA to balloon 112% while its free cash flow grew zero over the same period. Free cash flow is now 
trending down over the last 12 months. Days inventory and its cash collection cycle are near all-time highs; accounts receivables 
recently started to exceed sales


• Management’s annual cash bonuses are based solely on Adj. EBITDA, providing material incentive to inflate this financial metric
• Historically, radar systems is Mercury’s largest business, but now appears to be declining, while “Other Revenues” is the fastest 


growing segment. Mercury changed its financial presentation to bolster gross margins, while guidance for gross margins has quietly 
been talked down. For the first time in Q2’18, Mercury missed its gross margin (and EPS) target


• Mercury uses three different accounting methods for sales, but appears to be moving towards greater use of complex, subjective 
methods tied to percentage of completion accounting, an area notorious for accounting issues in the Aerospace & Defense industry


• Mercury sells itself as growing revenues organically 9.5% (double its end markets), yet we find evidence these results are not 
sustainable and growth may slow to 6.5% in CY 2018. Mercury announced the purchase of Themis Computer on Dec 21, 2017 (four 
days ahead of Christmas). It paid a rich 13.7x EBITDA multiple, and borrowed $189m on its line of credit. In our opinion, the deal 
appears motivated to avoid missing Wall Street’s expectations. Consistent with prior practice, we expect Mercury to issue stock to pay 
down its line of credit, which at the current share price, amounts to 4m new shares


• Mercury added one sentence to its latest 10-K to disclose it expects to lose its Small Business status in FY 2018, a factor that will cause 
a Material Adverse Effect by disqualifying it from certain business opportunities and increasing costs of compliance

Spruce Point Believes Sees 50% To 85% 
Downside Risk To Mercury’s Shares


Mercury’s Fmr. CFO Was EVP Strategic Affairs, Chief Legal Officer, and Secretary At Cabletron/Enterasys Networks A Business Fraud


• Mercury recently moved its headquarters into the exact same office where the Cabletron/Enterasys fraud unfolded
• Mercury’s long-time CFO Gerald Haines omits from his biography that he was the Chief Legal Officer and Secretary at Cabletron, 


making him a named executive and Board member. He abruptly resigned from Mercury in Feb 2018 after the closing of the 
Themis deal. Four of his colleagues at Cabletron were sentenced to prison, but Haines was not implicated


• In Sept 2017, Mercury’s Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer also abruptly resigned. Shortly before, and for the first time, 
Mercury’s proxy statement revealed a new anonymous hotline, email and website for reporting accounting concerns


• In Aug 2017, subtle changes to executive severance agreements were made to define conditions for termination for “Cause” and 
called out “Fraud” and “Dishonesty”


• Mercury’s audit fees per $ of sales and employee are the highest in the Aerospace & Defense industry, adding to our concerns of 
potential issues. The Audit Committee is chaired by William O’Brien, a colleague of the CEO dating back to 2003


Analysts See 25% Upside In Mercury, But Miss Key Material Risks, And Take Results At Face Value. We See 50% - 85% Downside:


• Mercury lacks meaningful institutional support from fundamental owners. Many have been decreasing ownership over time, 
while passive index buyers accumulate Mercury for its exposure to the Aerospace & Defense industry


• Mercury’s 2018E valuation of 4.7x, 19.3x and 31.5x sales, Adj. EBITDA and Adj. EPS is the highest in the Aerospace & Defense 
industry for peers over $1.5bn in value, and its multiple is stretched near all-time highs. Analysts assume its financials are fairly 
stated, and that it can achieve 16% and 10% sales and EPS growth in CY 2018. However, with issues at SEWIP, loss of its Small
Business status, and the recent acquisition of Themis, we estimate actual organic growth is set to decline significantly in CY 2018


• Mercury’s leverage should come into focus for investors. Having borrowed nearly $190m on its line of credit, and expanded its
operations to materially increase its operating leases, we estimate Net Debt / Adj EBITDAR of 1.5x. However, investors are better 
served looking at its debt load relative to its thin free cash flow. We estimate Net Debt / Free cash flow of 7.7x


• Given our accounting concerns that Adj. EBITDA is not reflecting Mercury’s underlying economics, we believe Mercury should be
valued on its stagnant free cash flow, which at a 20x-25x multiple, justifies 75% - 85% downside. Alternatively, taking sales at face 
value and applying a normal multiple to reflect its reduced organic growth, we arrive at 50% - 75% downside

Capital Structure and Valuation


Mercury is currently borrowing on its credit facility to fund the acquisition of Themis Computer, which closed on February 1, 2018. 
Consistent with prior deal funding practices, we expect the Company to issue equity, which would dilute investors with 


4 million new shares.  Our report will illustrate that Mercury’s valuation is the highest in the Aerospace & Defense industry on the 
belief that its industry leading Adjusted EBITDA margins are fairly stated, and its organic growth can continue at high single, low 
double digits per management’s comments. Our critical forensic analysis will suggest otherwise. We think investors should focus 


on its free cash flow, which is trending down, while its leverage is rising meaningfully.

Mercury’s Now $190m In Debt And 
Beholden To Its Creditors


Mercury amended its credit facility in June 2017 to increase its revolver to $400m, and made certain reps and 
warranties that its financial statements were accurate, and post closing, there were no material adverse effects. Our 


research questions the accuracy of Mercury’s financials, and provides evidence that indicates Mercury is 
experiencing material adverse changes related to SEWIP, its largest revenue program, and the upcoming loss 


of its Small Business status. 
Since signing this agreement both Mercury’s CFO, Chief Accounting Officer and Treasurer resigned.

Mercury Systems Connection To 
Enterasys Networks, A Former Fraud


Three key members of Mercury came from Enterasys Networks (formerly Cabletron), where they were credited with 
turning around the troubled company and selling it to Gores in 2006 (source). Many Enterasys executives went to jail 


and others settled with the SEC. Mercury’s recently resigned CFO, Gerald Haines, worked at Enterasys prior to the 
scandal unfolding as its Chief Legal Officer and Secretary, which he omits from his biography. 


It is unusual that Mercury management recently decided to move offices back into the site of Enterasys (source)

Spruce Point Calls To The Board For A 
Fresh Review of Mercury’s Financials


Mercury’s Board needs fresh independent eyes. Mercury’s auditor KPMG has been at the helm for 10yrs and being 
paid abnormally high fees. The Audit Committee chair Mr. O’Brien is a long-time colleague of CEO Aslett. We are 


asking Mercury’s newest Board member, Under Secretary of the Air Force, Ms. Lisa Disbrow for her objective review.

Mercury has been growing though the acquisitions of small companies and does not often disclose EBITDA contributions. The 
most recent acquisition of Themis caught our attention because of the large valuation multiple, and sudden resignation of the CFO 


just after the deal closing. The Themis deal was also announced on Dec 21, 2017 right near Christmas, which may indicate the 
urgency with which Mercury needed an acquisition to cover its increasingly apparent financial shortfalls.

On The Surface, Reported Organic 
Revenue Growth Looks Good


Mercury is selling investors on its organic growth that is growing at 2x the rate of its end markets. Mercury claims it is 
gaining market share and that it expects high single digit, low double digit organic growth to continue. (1)(2) However, 


we will lay out the case that organic growth is set to contract, and has not been translating into cash flow.

Evidence To Suggest Mercury’s 
Reduced Market Visibility, Slowing Growth


Mercury recently omitted a key slide about long-term end market growth it expects in key verticals (bottom left). 
Instead, it prefers to show where it is acquiring businesses. We believe that by excluding the recent acquisition of 
Themis and Delta Microwave, Mercury’s organic growth will decline in CY 18 below trend to approximately 6.5% (1)


Notice Now How Mercury Excludes Slide To Left In March 
2018, Favoring Acquisitions and Obscures Market Growth


Notice That Mercury Recently Gave Long-Term End Market 
Guidance To Investors As of Nov 2017


Source: Mercury Investor Day presentation, 11/7/17 Source: Mercury Investor Presentation, 3/1/18


1) Mercury’s CY 2017 reported revenues of $446.9m are reduced by $28.5m [Delta Microwave ($9.5m, closed on 4/3/17) and Creative ($19m, closed 11/2/16)]. Pro forma CY 2017 
revenues excluding acquisitions are $418.4m  Themis CY 2017 revenues estimated at $57m by Mercury and the deal closed 2/1/18. Wall St CY 2018 estimates for MRCY are $501m. 
Removing $52m of Themis revenue contribution and $3.2m of Delta contribution equals $445.7m of CY 2018 revenues. Therefore, pro forma organic revenue growth is estimated as 
($445.8/$418.4/)-1 = 6.5%. Note: Analysis conservatively assumes no growth in Themis CY 2018 sales and excludes the small Richland acquisition which Mercury has not disclosed sales.

Highly Improbable Financial Model


Mercury acts as an outsourced Tier 2 provider of solutions for prime defense contractors (subcontractor). 
96% of its business is to the federal government. Mercury reports the highest EBITDA margins in the 


aerospace and defense universe, well above its own customers. However, this does not correspond to the 
highest free cash flow margin. In fact, despite reporting a fairly low capex business model, Mercury's free 


cash flow margins are no better than the industry average. (1)

Source: Company filings
1) CFO comment on Q2’18 conference call says Mercury target “5% or less capex to sales”
2) We include FLIR in our analysis solely because some analysts reference them as a peer to MRCY. However, only 26% of FLIR’s revenues are derived from federal gov’t 
agencies and end markets vs. 96% for Mercury. Therefore, we do not believe FLIR to be a suitable comp due to its different economic characteristics

Significant And Growing Divergence: 
Adjusted EBITDA vs. Free Cash Flow


Investors should be worried that in three years from FY15 – FY17, Mercury’s EBITDA grew 112%, but its Free Cash 
Flow grew 0%. The growing delta (red bar in graph below) is accelerating, while in the LTM Dec 2017 period, Free Cash 
Flow is now declining. Management has made references to inventory build as the culprit on recent conference calls.

Warning: Management Paid Only On 
Adjusted EBITDA Margin


It should be no surprise that Mercury’s Adjusted EBITDA is rising rapidly. 
Management is solely incentivized by its compensation program to hit Adjusted EBITDA margin targets. 


It also has a very unusual compensation structure whereby targets are semiannual. 
Based on changes to the executive program in FY 2018, expect even more aggressive EBITDA expansion! 


Source: Proxy statement


Executive Bonus Program for Fiscal 2018


In establishing the executive bonus program for fiscal 2018, the Compensation Committee reviewed our multi-year performance and noted 
that our annual financial goals have been very aggressive relative to the financial performance of our peer group, with achievement of 
our strategic operating plan consistently positioning us in the top quartile. In order to provide incentives for continued top quartile performance 
going forward, the Committee increased the potential cash bonus payout for fiscal 2018, thereby putting an even larger percentage of 
an executive's overall potential compensation at risk based on performance. For fiscal 2018, the target bonus as a percentage of base 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer under the executive bonus program is 150%; for the Executive Vice President, Chief Operating Officer is 
110%; for each of the Executive Vice President, General Counsel and the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer is 90%; and for the 
Vice President, Controller, and Chief Accounting Officer is 50%. For fiscal 2018, the performance targets are based on the amount of our 
actual adjusted EBITDA measured in dollars compared to budgeted adjusted EBITDA as set forth in our strategic operating plan for fiscal 
2018, with targets again relating to the first and second halves of the fiscal year.

Financials Showing Strain


Post the acquisition of Microsemi’s carve out business in Q4’16, revenues grew faster than receivables. 
In light of Mercury’s difficulty generating cash flow growth (days inventory and cash conversion cycle at 


highs), and that receivables are now greater than revenues in Q1 and Q2 2018, we worry that the Company 
was aggressively booking revenues.

Warning: Reclassification To Boost 
Gross Margins Suggest Pressures


Mercury first disclosed a reclassification of costs from COGS to R&D expense in the Q1’2017 10-Q. This tactic served to increase
its gross margin reporting, and bolsters our argument that Mercury is covering up financial strains. We also observe that Mercury 


provided backward looking reclassification information, but not enough to determine the magnitude of the benefit it received in 
FY2017 when it first disclosed the reclassification.

Major Risk Factors Being Realized


Mercury’s traditional top three customers are becoming a smaller part of its business, while its historical business 
strength in radar becomes less relevant. 


Investors should be concerned that “Other” revenues are Mercury’s fastest growing segment.


Key Disclosures From Mercury’s FY 2017 Annual Report: 
• “As part of our strategy, we are focusing on being a commercial outsourcing partner to the large defense prime contractors as they seek the more 


rapid design, development and delivery of affordable, commercially developed, specialized processing solutions within the markets we serve”


• “We are dependent on a small number of customers for a large portion of our revenues. A significant decrease in the sales to or loss of any of 
our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.”


• “We are dependent on sales for radar applications for a large portion of our revenues. While our radar sales relate to multiple different 
platforms and defense programs, our revenues are largely dependent upon our customers incorporating our products into radar applications.”

Major Risk Factors Being Realized (Cont’d)


In the Q2’18 10-Q filing, Mercury started breaking out “Other Revenue” in slightly more detail, and the results are not 
encouraging. Two of its three largest segments are declining, including Radar, its largest market. Mercury now makes 


reference to “Effector” without any elaboration or prior mention on earnings conference calls. Not surprisingly, 
management is calling out the growth in C4I on its last conference call, while downplaying Radar’s decline (a)


(1) Radar includes end-use applications where radio frequency signals are utilized to detect, track, and identify objects.
(2) Electronic Warfare includes end-use applications comprising the offensive and defensive use of the electromagnetic spectrum.
(3) Other Sensor & Effector products include all Sensor & Effector end markets other than Radar and Electronic Warfare.
(4) C4I includes rugged secure rackmount servers that are designed to drive the most powerful military processing applications.
(5) Other products include all component and other sales where the end use is not specified.

now declining, including Radar, its

What is Effector? It has never been 
mentioned before by Mercury. The 


dictionary meaning relates to biology


Source: Q2’18 10-Q
(a) Q2’18: conference call, Mercury highlighted upfront the C4I growth “Mercury C4I revenues have grown 290% over the past 12 months compared with the prior period and now

Major Risk Factor Being Realized (Cont’d)


Mercury slipped in one sentence in its last Annual Report that has gone almost unnoticed by analysts and 
investors that represents a looming Material Adverse Effect on its business. We believe the major implications 


are that Mercury will lose out on business opportunities and increase its costs of doing business. 


We face other risks and uncertainties associated with defense-related contracts, which may have a material 
adverse effect on our business.


We qualify as a “small business” for government contracts purposes under the definition of that term in an applicable 
NAICS code because we have fewer than 1,250 employees. As we grow and potentially have a rolling 12-month 
average of over 1,250 employees in the future, we would no longer qualify as a small business. Loss of our small 
business status could negatively impact us, including our customers purchases from us would not qualify as 
purchases from a small business, customers may flow down additional Federal Acquisition Regulation, or FAR, 
clauses in their contracts with us that are less favorable than our existing contract terms and conditions. We expect 
to lose our status as a small business during fiscal 2018.


Source: 2017 Annual Report 10-K, p. 14


Mercury reported 1,159 employees as of June 30, 2017 in its 10-K Annual Report. We estimate Richland 
(acquired July 2017) contributed approximately 12 employees and Themis Computer (acquired Feb 2018) 


has between 50 to 200 employees.(1) 
Therefore, we believe Mercury is likely to be very close to the 1,250 employee limit.

Mercury's Promotion of the SEWIP 
Program and Undisclosed Cost 
Overrun Allegations
26


Mercury Promotes Its SEWIP Program, 
Expected To Be Material To Future Revenues


Key CEO Quotes on SEWIP (Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program) – Notably Block 3 


CEO Aslett – Jefferies Conf (Aug 17): “Three to four years ago, SEWIP was an emerging program. This past fiscal year, SEWIP was actually 
our largest bookings and revenue program, and that is really largely only SEWIP Block 2 today. As you probably know and as we've talked 
about, we're also now a part of the SEWIP Block 3 team with Northrop Grumman, and that's still in the engineering phase. So we do expect 
additional growth from that program. So the program has gone from zero to being our largest program in a relatively short space of time.”


CEO Aslett – Q3’2017 (April 2017) Earnings Call: “Mercury is a very innovative company and we’ve seen that on existing programs, such as 
Patriot where we continuing to chip away and win more business on the program, likewise on SEWIP, where again, we’re continuing to win 
more content on both Block 2, as well as Block 3.”


CEO Aslett – Q1’2017 (Oct 2016) Earnings Call: “Lockheed Martin just received their five year production contract on SEWIP Block 2 and we 
continue to do important work with Northrop Grumman and SEWIP Block 3.”


CEO Aslett Q2’2016 (Jan 2016) Earnings Call:   “We've had a longstanding relationship with Northrop and I would characterize it's been a 
strategic relationship. We weren't part of that team prior to the award mainly because I think we were working extremely closely with both 
Lockheed and Raytheon who were competing against Northrop for the SEWIP Block 3 business. However since they were awarded the
business, we've engaged or reengaged with them and we obviously know the SEWIP program well and we've got multiple sets of technologies 
and capabilities that are applicable for Block 3. And so I think its result of our capabilities, our relationships, our knowledge of the program that 
allowed us to basically win a pretty significant piece of the business on the program going forward.”


Diverse Mix of Stable, Growth Programs Aligned with DoD Funding Priorities. Our products and solutions have been deployed on more 
than 300 different programs and over 25 different defense prime contractors. We serve high priority markets for the DoD and foreign militaries, 
such as UAVs, ballistic missile defense, guided missiles and precision munitions, airborne reconnaissance, EW, and have secured positions on 
mission-critical programs including Aegis, Predator and Reaper UAVs, F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, Patriot missile, SEWIP, and Paveway


For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2016, the Surface Electronic Warfare Improvement Program ("SEWIP") program individually 
comprised 12% of our revenues.


Going forward, we believe the SEWIP, AEGIS, F-35, F-16 and the Patriot missile defense programs could be a large portion of our future 
revenues in the coming years, and the loss or cancellation of these programs could adversely affect our future results.

So Much “Potential” For Billions In Deals…


No surprise to us that Mercury no longer presents this slide in any of its investor presentations. The slide was 
marketed heavily in 2016 while Mercury was out promoting the Microsemi transaction and raising equity.

Inspector General Report on SEWIP: 
Allegations of Substantial Cost Overruns


On November 9, 2017 the Inspector General of the US DoD reported seven defense hotline allegations on Northrop 
Grumman’s SEWIP Block 3 program. Three allegations were substantiated, two were partially substantiated, and two 
were dismissed. While the exact amount of cost overruns have been redacted, the amount must have been material 
enough to merit of full investigation. Mercury has said it expects SEWIP to be material driver of its future revenues. 


The Company should explain to investors the materiality of the issues presented here.

More Evidence To Suggest A Cover-Up By 
Mercury of SEWIP Problems


As of Mercury’s last quarterly report, SEWIP mysteriously disappeared from a discussion of material programs despite the CEO 
claiming on the conference call it was the second largest revenue program. Recall from the previous slide, just months earlier in 


August 2017 the CEO said in reference to SEWIP “So we do expect additional growth from that program. So the program has 
gone from zero to being our largest program in a relatively short space of time.”  Therefore, it appears something went horribly 


wrong; from Sept 30th to Dec 31st SEWIP declined and was no longer reported as material.

Accounting and Financial 
Presentation Concerns

Background on Mercury’s 
Accounting Methods


 Contract accounting is often abused by companies, because 
revenues can be prematurely recognized, and costs can be 
underestimated, leading to gross margin inflation. When 
problems emerge, gross margins typically contract 


 Anticipated contract losses are typically accrued and 
reported in the financial footnotes


 Moreover, best financial disclosure practices suggest a 
detailed accounting of favorable, unfavorable and the “net” 
impact of contract changes or estimate revisions

1) CEO on Q2’18 call “So we've obviously worked extremely diligently since fiscal 2013 to reduce our dependency on what we would describe as book ship revenue...If you look on an 
LTM basis, the amount of book ship revenue that we have is around about 15% of total revenue”


Mercury reports using three different revenue accounting methods: Ship and Bill, Multiple Deliverable Arrangements and 
Contract Accounting. Ship and Bill is fairly straight forward, and mirrors standard revenue recognition criteria such as 


persuasive evidence of a sale arrangement (fixed price and collection assured), with title and risk passing to the customer. The
other two methods used are more complex and leave significant judgement in the hands of management. 


Mercury appears to be moving towards more complex accounting methods


Percentage of Mercury Revenues By Accounting Method


 We observe that Mercury does not disclose its net 
adjustments. The next slide shows Mercury’s 
customers abide by this best practice. How much 
of Mercury’s EBITDA is being juiced by favorable 
contract accounting changes?


 We observe that Mercury reports a de minimis 
$0.50m of loss accrual costs in accrued expenses. 
Hard to believe it is so low given $447m of sales


 We observe that Mercury’s gross margins are 
contracting and it missed its Q2’18 guidance 
(the first miss in many quarters)

Percentage-of-Completion Schemes Common In 
Aerospace and Defense And A Current SEC Focus


SEC Enforcement Director Speech (2013): “Revenue recognition issues will remain a staple of our financial fraud caseload – this fraud often 
takes many forms, whether by recognizing revenue through sham transactions, prematurely recognizing revenue, distorting percentage of 
completion accounting, using schemes to inflate sales numbers, or billing for uncompleted products through a “pre-booking” scheme.”


Company / Industry Year Note


Orbital ATK / Aerospace 2016
The Restatement is primarily a result of a non-cash error in the application of purchase accounting with respect to a 
limited number of long-term contracts, which are accounted for under the percentage-of-completion method


Toshiba / Diversified 2015


Toshiba Corp. must correct at least 152 billion yen ($1.2 billion) of pretax earnings over a six year period after an 
internal accounting probe revealed the company overstated profits. The company initially uncovered irregularities 
related to “percentage of completion” estimates used on infrastructure projects, including nuclear, hydroelectric, 
wind-power equipment, air-traffic control and railway systems


L-3 Communications / 
Aerospace


2014


Receives SEC subpoena and DOJ investigation and pays fine of $1.6m and $4.6m, respectively to each agency 
(source). The cases relate to improper revenue accounting at L3’s aerospace systems segment that resulted in the 
contractor’s correcting financial results over a roughly four-year period starting in 2011 and firing at least four 
employees.


Cubic Corp / Aerospace
2012 
and 


2014
Changes will result in an increase in revenues and net income cumulatively over the period 


Computer Sciences
/ IT Services


2011
The anticipated result of the restatement is to reduce net income by ~$50 in FY 2010 and ~$3.69 billion in FY 2011 
and to increase net income in FY 2012 by ~$3.90 billion. Settled with the SEC for $190m


Recent Accounting Restatements and SEC Investigations of Percentage-of-Completion Accounting Cases


Former Mercury CFO Haines (Oct 2017): “And then often some of those large subsystems are actually scoring revenue on a percentage of 
completion basis. And there can be timing issues around when we are recognizing the revenue as we are working through it and when we 
actually convert that revenue into cash over time.”

Troubling Insider Behavior and

Troubling Signs Suggesting An 
Accounting Scandal Cover-Up


Is it more than a coincidence that Mercury’s Chief Accounting Officer resigned right after the Company started to 
highlight it has methods for reporting accounting problems anonymously? The CFO, a lawyer by background and not a 


seasoned financial professional, also resigned.


2017 Proxy Adds New Discussion of Reporting 
Anonymous Accounting Concerns


Source: 2017 Mercury Proxy – Filed September 5, 2017
Note: Prior 2016 Proxy excludes the above statement


Does Mercury have a method for the anonymous 
reporting of accounting concerns?


Yes. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics includes 
a means for the anonymous reporting of any concerns 
about accounting, internal accounting controls, or auditing 
matters. Any employee, supplier, customer, shareholder, 
or other interested party can submit a report via the 
following anonymous methods:


• by telephone voicemail at 866-277-5739;
• by emailing directly to mrcy@openboard.info; or
• by submitting a complaint via the internet at 


www.openboard.info/mrcy/websubmit.cfm.


Executive Appointed Resigns Concerns


Gerald Haines
CFO 


Sept 2014 Feb 2018


• Haines’ bio discloses he worked at 
Cabletron and Enterasys Networks, while 
his Linkedin bio omits the Cabletron 
reference or that he was Chief Legal 
Officer and named executive


• He was SVP and General Counsel (Chief 
Legal Officer) of Enterasys/Cabletron from 
2000-2001 during the early part of the 
Enterasys financial scandal unwinding


• Haines resigned from Mercury abruptly 
after closing Themis (Feb 2018)


• Note: Haines, a lawyer by background, 
had always served as General Counsel at 
prior jobs (Verenium, Enterasys, Applied
Extrusion Tech), never as a CFO

Speicher

Accounting

Other Hints Management Wants More 
Perks On Its Way Out The Door


Paying close attention to Mercury’s recent 10-K, we find at the very end of the document it discloses that the 
Compensation Committee approved beneficial changes to executive departure terms. Also, Mercury explicitly defined 


what the condition for termination for “Cause” would be, calling out “Fraud” and “Dishonesty”


Source: Mercury FY 2017 10-K ITEM 9B


On August 14, 2017, the Compensation Committee approved (and with respect to matters for the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, the 
independent directors on the Company’s Board of Directors approved) the following executive compensation matters:


• an increase for the annual perquisite for the Company’s executive officers from up to $2,000 annually for personal tax and financial planning to a $4,000 
annual allowance for personal tax and financial planning;


• an amendment to Mr. Aslett's employment agreement to provide that he is entitled to continue to participate in the Company’s group health, dental, and 
vision programs for 24 months following a termination of his employment by the Company without “cause” or by him for “good reason” (as defined in his 
employment agreement); and


• an agreement for each of the Company’s non-CEO named executive officers that provides for termination and severance benefits in the case of a 
termination of the executive's employment by the Company without “cause” or by the executive for “good reason.”


For the agreements for the Company’s non-CEO named executive officers, the following terms and conditions apply.


“Cause” is defined in the agreement to include: (1) the willful and continued failure by the executive to perform substantially the duties and responsibilities 
of his position with the Company after written demand; (2) the conviction of the executive by a court of competent jurisdiction for felony criminal 
conduct or a plea of nolo contendere to a felony; or (3) the willful engaging by the executive in fraud, dishonesty, or other misconduct which is 
demonstrably and materially injurious to the Company or its reputation, monetarily, or otherwise. No act, or failure to act, on the executive’s part 
will be deemed “willful” unless committed or omitted by the executive in bad faith and without reasonable belief that his act or failure to act was in, or not 
opposed to, the best interest of the Company.


“Good Reason” is defined in the agreement to include: (1) a material diminution in the executive's responsibilities, authority, or duties as in effect on the 
date of the agreement; (2) a material diminution in the executive's annual base salary, except for across-the-board salary reductions based on the 
Company’s financial performance similarly affecting all or substantially all senior management employees of the Company; or (3) a material change in the 
geographic location at which the executive provides services to the Company.


Under the agreement, if the Company terminates the executive's employment without “cause” or the executive his employment for “good reason,” then the 
Company will pay the executive a severance amount equal to one times his annual base salary. In such event, the Company also will pay for certain 
insurance benefits and outplacement services

Irrational Valuation Expansion


Source:  MRCY Financial Statements, CapitaIIQ


Enterprise Value / NTM Revenues Enterprise Value / NTM EBITDA Price / Book Value


Current investors are paying a significant premium to the Company’s historical valuation.
Spruce Point finds it difficult to explain its valuation expansion in light of the Company’s signs of financial 
strain, pending loss of its small business designation, allegations of cost overruns at its biggest revenue 


program, abrupt management departures and insider selling.

Mercury Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


Mercury’s valuation is by far the highest in the aerospace and defense industry. We believe the valuation is being 
driven by the belief its EBITDA margins and revenue growth rate are superior to peers. However, we have detailed our 
concerns about margin overstatement, and believe most of the revenue growth is acquired (inorganic), which should 


not be valued at the same rate as pure organic growth.

Mercury’s current EV/2018E sales multiple of 4.7x is 
astronomically high relative to peers on the belief 
that its ~16% revenue growth is the fastest in the 


industry. However, a majority of the growth in 2018 
is coming from the acquisition of Themis. In our 


opinion, Mercury overpaid for Themis to cover-up 
financial problems. Excluding contributions from 


Themis (and to a lesser extent Delta Microwave), we 
estimate just 6.5% underlying organic growth in CY 


2018, below the long-term average of 9.5% (1)

We estimate Themis contributes net $2.7m of free 
cash flow ($7.2m of free cash flow, reduced by 


$4.5m of incremental interest expense) per 
Mercury’s pro forma disclosures. We also adjust for 
incremental rent expense of $1.7m. Peers trade at 


an average of 25x EV/FCF, but MRCY should trade at 
a discount given its inability to increase free cash 


flow for three years


$ in millions, except per share amounts


Given our concerns about the reliability of Mercury’s Adjusted EBITDA, we believe the most conservative way to value 
the Company is on its stagnant free cash flow.


1) Mercury’s CY 2017 reported revenues of $446.9m are reduced by $28.5m [Delta Microwave ($9.5m, closed on 4/3/17) and Creative ($19m, closed 11/2/16)]. Pro forma CY 2017 revenues 
excluding acquisitions are $418.4m  Themis CY 2017 revenues estimated at $57m by Mercury and the deal closed 2/1/18. Wall St CY 2018 estimates for MRCY are $501m. Removing 
$52m of Themis revenue contribution and $3.2m of Delta contribution equals $445.7m of CY 2018 revenues. Therefore, pro forma organic revenue growth is estimated as ($445.8/$418.4/)-1 
= 6.5%. Note: Analysis conservatively assumes no growth in Themis CY 2018 sales and excludes the small Richland acquisition which Mercury has not disclosed sales.


Note: Downside Based on $46/share
