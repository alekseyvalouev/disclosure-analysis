SodaStream

Squeaky Clean

Several months ago, we shared our opinion that SODA was buying its Italian
distributor to provide a revenue and EBITDA boost through accounting
shenanigans. Simplistically, SODA previously made sales into its channel,
recognizing revenue. Then, they bought the distributor, assumed the
inventory, and could re-sell the product, effectively recognizing sales two times
on the same product. We believe this accounting treatment was the same
methodology used in the past when SODA bought its Nordic distributor. Recall,
on its Q2'13 earnings call, when management casually announced they had
bought their Italian distributor, the company guided for a minimal impact from
the transaction. To be precise, SODA guided for the transaction to add "$2
million" of sales in the second half of 2013. Also, they confessed (or blamed)
that they had assumed $10 million of Italian inventory from the distributor
they acquired. See below (emphasis added):


Q2'13 Call from 7/31/13


Jim Chartier: Good morning. The first question, how much did the acquisition
of Italy add to your outlook for 2013 revenues?


Daniel Erdreich (NASDAQ:CFO): Yeah, it won't be that significant, it will be
a couple of millions on top line and there won't be any impact on bottom line.

Jon R. Andersen: Can I just confirm, on the Italian - the acquisition of the
Italian distributor, your expectation is that will add about $2 million in the
second half of the year to sales, no impact on the bottom line, and kind of

$4 million on an annual run rate basis, is that the right way to think about
that?


Daniel Erdreich (CFO): That's right, Jon.


------


Scott Van Winkle: Hi, thanks, good quarter. Most of my questions have been
asked, but just a couple follow-ups. On net inventory, I think you talked about
Italy maybe selling through some inventory, having to work through is it; is
that referring to the $10 million of inventory you took on with the acquisition
or more in store?


Daniel Erdreich (CFO): No it's - the $10 million that was taken as
inventory is the increase, is the main item of increase in inventory that
we see in the account.

As we pondered after the Q2'13 call - SodaStream had already recognized
revenue on its sales into the Italian distributor, hence they could double count
the revenue based on the purchase accounting methodology. If SODA was
assuming $10 million of inventory, then presumably that was $21.7 million of
prior sales SODA had recognized into this distributor (assumingcthe corporate
gross margin of 54%). Therefore, future sales of this newly assumed inventory
would effectively create a double-counting effect on revenue.


SodaStream just reported its Q3'13 earnings and concluded its conference call.
The stock is down about 6%, but will likely be down significantly more as
investors and analyst digest the slew of issues. We do not believe the
shenanigans we identified are understood, nor even responsible for any
portion of the sell-off. Not yet at least. The stock is likely down because:


they missed the top line
missed Americas sales by a wide margin (with growth decelerating to sub-
30% after growing 88% last year and over 65% in the first half)
flavor sales collapsed to only 7% growth year-over-year, while Americas
saw flavor sales decline year-over-year
APAC declined by 21% year-over-year
DSO's jumped to 86

And inventory was up 43% year-over-year despite sales growth that slowed
to 28.5%
And for the first time in many quarters, they were unable to raise guidance


The lone bright spot appeared to be Western Europe, its largest region, which
inexplicably experienced year-over-year accelerating growth. The region grew
43% year-over-year, which was a huge jump from the 21.6% reported in the
first half. This, despite deceleration and/or declines in every other geography.
We believe that the "surprising" growth in Western Europe can be attributed to
its Italian distributor. Further, our analysis, which could of course be wrong,
leads us to believe management has completely understated the Italian
contribution. This acquisition alone appears responsible for the accelerating
growth.


On the Q3'13 quarterly call, the CFO unequivocally stated that part of the
inventory jump year-over-year was due to $6 million of remaining Italian
inventory. Based on the $10 million of initial Italian inventory disclosed on the
Q2'13 call, we can conclude that $4 million of inventory was sold in Q3'13 (10-
6=4). If we assume a gross margin inline with the corporate average, the $4
million of inventory that was sold would have resulted in $8.7 million of
revenue contribution during Q3'13. Recall, management said on its Q2'13 call
the Italian distributor sales would only contribute "$2 million" in the entire
second half. This appears to be rather inaccurate.


Turning back to the confounding acceleration in Western Europe growth, we
believe net of our calculated Italian distributor contribution, revenue growth
was inline. Western Europe delivered $75.5 million of revenue vs. $52.6 million
in Q3'12. However, if we reduce the Q3'13 revenue by our estimation of the
Italian distributor contribution of $8.7 million, then Western Europe would
have delivered growth of 27% ($66.8 million vs. $52.6 million YoY). This still
represents respectable growth, but would have turned a small overall miss in
Q3'13 into a much more problematic miss.


We continue to believe that SodaStream is playing extremely loose and fast
with its numbers and communication. We also think they will be unable to
grow significantly in 2014 without major door expansion OR by accounting
shenanigans through another distributor acquisition. Should SodaStream buy
another distributor, specifically its Japanese distributor, who as recently as last
quarter SodaStream was putting more marketing muscle behind, then we
