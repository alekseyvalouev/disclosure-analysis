Miller Energy: Digging Itself Into Another Deep Hole?

Miller Energy Resources (Nasdaq: MILL) sure has proven one thing to the world, and it's
not the tremendous value of the discarded oil reserves that the company picked up for
next to nothing after more sophisticated players said, "No, thank you," either. Rather, as a
bleeding energy firm buried underneath a mountain of expensive debt - with that weighty
burden set to grow even heavier in a matter of weeks - Miller has by now established that,
if nothing else, it certainly knows how to dig itself into a dangerous hole.


Take the daunting challenge that Miller will face next month, just for starters. Desperate for
cash earlier this year and now on the hook for the promises that it made in order to secure
those essential funds, Miller must somehow find a way to come up with $75 million by the
end of January in order to avoid loan-shark interest rates (approaching the 20% mark) on
every bit of the bank debt that the firm currently owes. For a company with barely $20
million to its name right now - and commitments to cover not only the double-digit interest
payments that it already owes to both its lenders and its preferred stockholders but also
the $60 million that it just pledged for a major acquisition to boot - Miller can hardly afford
for its hairy predicament to grow even worse at this point.


To Chapman Capital Founder Robert Chapman, the former boss of Miller President/Acting
CFO David Voyticky and an obvious skeptic of both the company and its senior
management team, Miller barely even resembles a normal energy firm since it focuses so
much of its attention on raising capital that it seems to market its stock as its primary
product while selling a little bit of oil on the side.


"The gross production numbers are not big - they're tiny - and the company is still cash-
flow negative (from operations combined with necessary capitalized investments), so it
has to keep selling this story about its monstrous reserves," Chapman recently noted
during a revealing interview with TheStreetSweeper about the five-month period when he
employed Voyticky as a partner at his firm and found the future Miller executive too
incompetent (or unwilling) to fulfill the transactional activist, non-investor relations duties
required of that post.


"In the meantime, just look at the company!” Chapman declared. “It’s a preferred stock-
issuance machine that seems to be more in the business of raising money than making
money. And to me, it looks like a stock that's driven by a myth."

Like other dubious investors, Chapman refuses to buy that story. Indeed, Miller strikes the
fund manager as a dangerous company that has placed its trust in an executive that
(based upon his own firsthand experience) lacks any substantial skills outside of his ability
to raise capital by "smooth-talking investors and lenders into parting with their funds."


“With Voyticky involved,” Chapman bluntly proclaimed, “I can’t think of many better targets
for a short.”


Don't mistake Bristol Capital Advisors as a noble savior just because that "activist" firm
suddenly feels driven to overthrow the current leadership due to its alleged incompetence
and obvious greed, either. After all, Bristol secured its sizable stake in Miller courtesy of
lucrative consulting deals originally awarded - but recently cancelled - by the same
boardroom directors that the "outraged" firm now aims to replace with a brand-new slate
of its own.


If history serves as any guide, Miller could pay a rather steep price for that intervention
should Bristol ultimately succeed.


A notorious firm led by Paul Kessler - a former consultant to the company -- that often
caters to obscure firms in the penny-stock arena, Bristol has regularly provided welcome
cash to desperate microcap players that later wind up in agonizing pain. They often face
the threat of massive dilution or, if dogged by accusations of outright fraud, can go
completely bankrupt instead. Their shares may sink to mere pennies (or even lower),
history shows, with regulators sometimes stepping in to block them from trading
altogether.


By now, Miller has already shown that the company can make a big enough mess without
that sort of "help" all by itself. Back when its stock weathered a nasty hit on a revealing
investigative report published by TheStreetSweeper two years ago, after all, Miller
responded with such a reckless move - prematurely assuring the market that its
independent auditors had verified the gigantic reserves listed on its balance sheet - that
the company practically sent its battered shares into a full-blown death spiral. Despite that
harrowing experience, however, Miller still acts like a company that never learned its
lesson at all.


In short, Miller seems just as tempted as ever to pump more than ordinary crude oil.


Take the impressive figures that Miller released to investors ahead of its latest quarterly
report, for example. After rushing to pre-announce that it had sold "over 200,000 barrels"
of oil during its most recent quarter, Miller has since followed up with actual results

showing that the company never even produced that much oil in the first place. While
Miller scrambled to address that disparity with a rather vague explanation, suggesting that
it may have included sales of oil from its previous inventory in that total, the company
basically undermined even that handy excuse by posting revenue figures that failed to
reflect any contribution from that excess supply.


With its stock already riding a powerful wave of momentum by the time that the company
presented that update, impressing bullish analysts who somehow overlooked its curious
math, Miller kept right on flying to hit a record high just shy of the $9 mark - almost triple
the price that it had commanded at beginning of the year -- and only lost its steam when
the proxy battle erupted to knock the wind out of its highflying shares. Even after an ugly
haircut that chopped its stock by 15% last week to end around $7.50 a share, however,
Miller still boasts a handsome $340 million market value that strikes many financial
experts as far too generous for a bleeding oil company with relatively modest production
but incredibly burdensome debt.


By assigning a reasonable valuation to its oil reserves and then subtracting its mountain of
debt from that total, one hedge fund manager recently calculated, the true value of Miller
lies somewhere between a measly $17 million on the conservative end of the spectrum
and $107 million on the very highest end of that broad range. With almost 50 million fully
diluted shares at last count, those figures suggest, Miller should trade as a lowly penny
stock fetching as little as 35 cents and no more than $2.20 a share - or 70% less than its
current price - at the absolute best.


“Nobody else wanted to buy those assets anywhere near the price Miller paid, much less
where they are valued by the company today,” he reminded. “They figured there was
nothing highly valuable there (after estimating the size of the reserves and the costs
associated with extracting the oil).


"What Miller did was kind of ingenious, actually. When you buy reserves, it's something
that's inherently ambiguous. You don't know how much oil you have under the ground,
how much it will cost you to produce it or how much you will be able to charge for it, either.


"So you don't know quantity, cost or price. Those are three big levers that you can pull
when you're estimating the value of reserves to arrive at a really big number. (But) nobody
really knows how much those assets are actually worth."


While its reserves looked wildly overvalued back when TheStreetSweeper first
investigated the company a couple of years ago, since it bought those abandoned assets
for a paltry $4.5 million and then miraculously valued them at a whopping $350 million on
