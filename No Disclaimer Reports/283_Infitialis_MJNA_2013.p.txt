Chronically Criminal: Shielding The Public From Medical Marijuana

Note: This article has been updated at the author's request.


Infitialis is a research collective that exposes fraud and folly in an effort to identify bubbles
before they implode and our track record of success speaks for itself. In this report, we will
be exposing fraud heaped on top of folly.


Infitialis Track Record of Exposing Fraud and Folly is Unmatched


Introduction


Medical Marijuana, Inc. (OTCPK:MJNA) ("Medical Marijuana" or the "Company") is a
penny stock company run by criminals and alleged fraudsters. While medical marijuana
may be a growing business opportunity in selected states, there is no place for blatant
stock fraud in the United States capital markets, and we strongly believe the intrinsic value
of MJNA is $0.00/share due to the significant malfeasance discussed below.


In this report, we will discuss how MJNA listed on the OTC Markets (formerly known as
the pink sheets) under a weird, but quasi-legal, exemption known as "Unsolicited
Quotation" whereby shares only trade by appointment of retail order flow. In other words,
there is no active market for the issuer's securities and on a whim all bids/offers can
instantaneously vanish, leading to choppy trading and large valuation swings. Despite our
extensive market experience, this is the first time we have ever run into this type of
security with a >$100mm market valuation, let alone a $355mm market valuation.
Moreover, based on our discussions with securities counsel, the SEC has all but done
away with these types of companies save for a select few like Medical Marijuana that have
somehow so far escaped the eyes of the regulators.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 2/97


Adding insult to injury, because MJNA is a non-SEC reporting issuer, it has almost no real
obligations to its shareholders. Here are a few examples of what MJNA can get away with
that 99.9% of public companies cannot:


1. MJNA does not have to file financial statements with the SEC or make available
any material disclosures to its shareholders.


2. MJNA does not have to file quarterly or annual disclosure reports with the SEC
according to the laws and regulations of the 1934 Securities Act


3. Officers and Directors of MJNA have no obligation to shareholders to operate
within Sarbanes-Oxley or any other financial controls promulgated by the
Commission following the various accounting scandals that erupted in the wake
of the Enron, WorldCom, and Tyco situations following the dot-com crash.


MJNA Appears to be a Significant Stock Scam And Not a Legitimate Enterprise


MJNA has recently been able to obtain the shocking market valuation of $355.6mm
making it more valuable than well-known consumer brands of Pacific Sunwear of
California, Inc. (NASDAQ:PSUN) and Jamba, Inc. (NASDAQ:JMBA) COMBINED. These
two well-known brands on a consolidated basis have >7,600 employees, >1,500 physical
retail locations around the world, and generate >$1bn in annual revenue. Conversely,
Medical Marijuana, Inc. is controlled by and operated by a 28 year old fraudster. In this
report, we will outline several more red flags relating to MJNA and its management team
with the goal of demonstrating that MJNA has no intrinsic value. Ultimately it is our opinion
that the hard facts we will uncover cast serious doubt as to the accuracy or legitimacy of
this company as a going concern. Bluntly, we strongly believe based on the data
uncovered to date that Medical Marijuana, Inc. is "cooking the books."


We have gone over this many times when we release our expos√©s. Legitimate companies
do not go public via OTC RTOs unless they have no other viable route to capital.
Moreover, in our view legitimate companies don't choose an unsolicited pink sheet as their
platform to market unless they are illegitimate. There is no advantage to such a vehicle
unless one is purposely trying to circumvent the United States securities regulations
explicitly designed to protect investors.

As discussed in further detail, these valuation metrics are completely preposterous and
should be yet another red-flag for investors. The issue with MJNA is that we do not believe
the financials and as we will demonstrate in the next sections there is little reason for
anybody to believe they are real as they have been audited by an auditor who is not
qualified to perform an audit and have been signed by a member of management who at
the time of signing had announced a leave of absence from the company (more on this in
detail in the next sections).


Moreover, because of the continuous issuance of additional shares, such an investor
would continue to have their stake diluted down to even less meaningful levels.


In addition to the numerous valuation red-flags, Medical Marijuana, Inc. common share
count has increased a shocking 44.7% over the last 12 month and almost 200% over the
last 24 months for dubious reasons, further diluting investors. In that time period, the
Company has issued in excess of 550mm common shares worth over $200mm at the
current market valuation.


Management Team - Is this Who You Want Running Your Company?


As per the Medical Marijuana 2012 "Investor Fact Sheet" available on the Company
website, the following individuals are key members of the MJNA team. This toxic brew of
criminals and alleged fraudsters should give any investor serious concerns.

Ms. Michelle L. Sides - "Chairman" and Chief Operating Officer


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Ms. Michelle L. Sides is the Chairman of
the Board, Chief Operating Officer, and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the Company
through her beneficial ownership of Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corp. In addition, she
is purportedly a Member of the Florida State Bar Association and possess extensive
experience in corporate and real estate law. Interestingly, the Florida Bar records for Ms.
Michelle Sides indicate she was previously the "Corporate Counsel" and sole employee
for "North American Companies, LLC," the same entity Mr. Michael Llamas purportedly
founded and utilized to execute "in excess of ten billion dollars in transactions" for
distressed debt. However, in reality, Ms. Michelle Sides has been kicked out of the Florida
Bar for unspecified reasons (rendering her not eligible to practice in Florida).


Simply put, it is hard to imagine trusting Ms. Michelle Sides with a library book, let alone
as the lead manager for a $355mm publicly traded company. Unfortunately, for most retail
investors in MJNA this is the first they have heard about this because Ms. Sides has
fraudulently omitted this material information from her official biographies and disclosures.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 5/97


Michael Llamas (Age - 28) - President and Director


According to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Mr. Michael Llamas (age 28) has served
as President and Director of the Company and also indirectly controls ~ 48% of the
Company through his beneficial ownership of Hemp Deposit and Distribution Corp. Also,
according to multiple Medical Marijuana filings, Mr. Michael Llamas' sole prior business
experience was founding North America Companies LLC, a real estate development and
acquisitions firm specializing in distressed debt that completed "in excess of ten billion
dollars in transactions." Notably absent from Medical Marijuana filings is ANY discussion
of Mr. Michael Llamas prolific prior indictments for fraud and financial shenanigans.


First, on 09/14/12, Mr. Michael Llamas was indicted by the United States for the Eastern
District of California along with six other individuals for a case involving for 19 counts of
Mail Fraud and 31 counts of Wire Fraud related to a mortgage fraud scheme that caused
more than $10mm in losses to mortgage lenders and others. According to the indictment,
Mr. Michael Llamas would approach builders of new homes and developers of
condominiums to purchase investment homes in bulk at substantial price discounts
ranging from 30 to 50 percent off under the terms of an "option contract." Mr. Michael
Llamas had no financial ability and no intention of purchasing the homes; rather, the
homes were to be sold to an associate's nominee members at full price. Mr. Michael
Llamas then arranged for an affiliated mortgage company, Nationwide Lending Group
(NLG), to sell mortgage loans for the nominees with banks and other lenders at the full
price of the homes without disclosing the large price discount. Lenders were thereby
misled into advancing loans that far exceeded their lending guidelines. Also, the large
option contract price discount was used to conceal the lack of required down payments by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 6/97


nominee buyers. Mr. Michael Llamas then split what remained of the price discount after
subtraction of the fake down payments and certain fees with his cronies. In addition, Mr.
Michael Llamas induced at least one home builder to record false liens in favor of one of
their entities, Cobalt One LLC, for millions of dollars in bogus loans to cover up large
payments from an associated firm to Cobalt One. If convicted, the Mr. Michael Llamas and
the other defendants face a maximum statutory penalty for each violation of mail and wire
fraud of 20 years in prison, a $250,000 fine, and a three-year term of supervised release.
As of 12/11/12, Mr. Michael Llamas has been released on bail pending trial (Appendix B).


On 09/17/12, just three days after being indicted by the Eastern District of California, Mr.
Michael Llamas announced a "leave of absence effective immediately" from Medical
Marijuana in order to "focus his attention on personal business matters." However, Mr.
Michael Llamas signed off and certified the Medical Marijuana 09/30/12 Financial and
Information Disclosure Statement (Appendix C) as the Company's "President. This is one
of many reasons why we believe the MJNA financials are fraudulent and most likely
fabricated.


More interesting is the fact that on 09/30/12 and 12/02/12, Mr. Michael Llamas and
Mr. Michael Corrigan, Esq. (MJNA's external counsel), respectively, certified that no
members of the Company's management team had been subject to "a conviction in
a criminal proceeding or named as a defendant in a pending criminal proceeding in
the past five years" (Appendix C & D). This appears to be a blatant fabrication in
regards to Mr. Michael Llamas prior court records. Moreover, THIS CLEARLY
VIOLATES the OTC Pink Basic Disclosure Guidelines SECTION 8B.1


Next, on 12/05/07, Mr. Michael Llamas was sued by Mr. and Mrs. David Villar in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of California for the Fraudulent Transfer
of the couple's home in San Mateo California via a $830k purchase option agreement
(Case No. 05-35167 TCLS)(Appendix E). While the matter was eventually privately
settled, it appears Mr. Michael Llamas was forced to pay restitution to the Villars.


Similarly, on 12/08/06, Mr. Michael Llamas (who was 22 at the time), was arrested by the
Tracy, California police department on charges of forgery, grand theft, financial elder
abuse and conspiracy. Specifically, Mr. Michael Llamas was accused of hoodwinking an
elderly couple into believing they had negotiated a reverse mortgage based on the $485k
equity value of their home, but instead transferred the title of the property to an entity
Llamas controlled for de minimis consideration.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 7/97


Mr. Michael Llamas seems to have engaged in such extensive mortgage fraud schemes
against so many other unsuspecting victims that there an anonymous blog was created in
2009 dedicated to tracking his activities. More information is available via:
http://mikellamas.blogspot.ca/


In summary, based on Mr. Michael Llamas exhaustive history of mail, wire, and mortgage
fraud, it is inconceivable he could effectively serve as a President and Director of a
$370mm publicly traded company. In this case, the reality of the situation is even worst as
Mr. Michael Llamas is not only the President and Director of Medical Marijuana, Inc., but
also the largest and controlling shareholder. We have good reason to believe that Mr.
Michael Llamas is directly involved in the liquidation of the free trading shares and will
cover this in more detail the next section.


Mr. Theodore Caligiuri - Purportedly Chief Executive Officer


On 09/30/12, Medical Marijuana announced it hired Mr. Theodore Caligiuri as "Interim
President and CEO." Interestingly, Mr. Theodore Caligiuri seems to be completely lacking
any prior experience as a manager of any publicly traded company, has yet to sign-off on
any financial statements, and still works as a residential real estate agent for Coldwell
Banker. In our opinion, he is completely unqualified to be the leader of a public enterprise
with a $356mm market value.


Say What?! HDDC Controls And Sells $1.5mm In Free Trading Shares On Behalf Of
MJNA


In what has to be one of the oddest cases of illegal share distribution/underwriting,
Medical Marijuana appears to sells its own shares to the public via a conduit (Llamas)
without a registration statement. This is blatantly illegal and after speaking to several
lawyers we are still unsure as to how the these two got this far without anybody else
figuring this out.


Below is an excerpt from the (OTCPK:MJNA) disclosure on the otcmarkets.com website.


Essentially, Mr. Michael Llamas, the 28 year old who controls MJNA, is identified as the
main party responsible for providing "working capital." In other words, Llamas is directly
financing MJNA. Mr. Michael Llamas does so by liquidating free trading shares of MJNA
he was awarded for almost ZERO consideration as part of the RTO. Not all of this
information is clearly disclosed as the Company does not elect to do so. However, by

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 8/97


reconciling the quarterly paid-in capital amount vs. the common shares outstanding, we
strongly believe the weighted average price MJNA has been selling its common shares to
Mr. Michael Llamas for less than $0.01/ while retail investors have just months later been
clamoring hand over first to purchase the shares at $0.40-0.50.


Apparently Ms. Michelle Sides has a side-deal with Mr. Michael Llamas whereby Llamas
holds, and most probably sells, free trading shares of MJNA on behalf of MJNA! As of
12/31/2012 disclosure date, Llamas held $1.5 million worth (or 15 million shares at the
time) of MJNA free trading shares on behalf of MJNA, effectively allowing the public
company to sell its own shares via a conduit. Craziest of all is that this $1.5mm is reflected
on the Company's own balance sheet and "audited" by a non-PCAOB registered
"independent auditor," Mr. Anthony Imbimbo.


The Auditor/Professional Cook Who Isn't PCAOB Registered


On 01/16/13 and with much fan-fare, Medical Marijuana Inc. issued a press release
announcing it had for the first time completed an "audit" and that it was publishing its
audited results to the investing public. On the back of this "development," retail investors
bid up shares of MJNA to as high as $0.54/share for an implied valuation of nearly half a
billion dollars!


It took us two seconds to figure out that the "Auditor" was in fact not licensed to audit
public companies at all. A public company audit must be carried out by a PCAOB (Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board) registered auditor. Otherwise, it's not a legitimate
audit, period end statement.


The so called "auditor" is actually a sole-practitioner (a la Madoff) CPA/Cook (we are not
making this stuff up Imbimbo has a degree from the Culinary Institute of America) named
Anthony W. Imbimbo. Imbimbo is clearly not qualified to audit a public company of with a
market valuation of this size and is one of the many reasons we believe the financials
cannot and should not be relied upon.


Having Their Cake And Eating it Too: Insider Sales - Extensive 144 Sales


In what is yet another example that solidifies our thesis that MJNA is nothing more than a
stock scam - MJNA insiders not only engage the services of Llamas to sell stock, they
also use rule 144, a rule we believe is not legally available to this company.


Rule 144 sales are only those sales made by active insiders and are limited to less than
1% of the outstanding a year. Based on the 144 filings, we believe there may have been
much more insider selling. In just one example we found (Appendix F) a transaction made

by Coldwell Banker real estate agent/ MJNA CEO Theodore Caligiuri whereby Mr.
Caligiuri is a willing seller of 461,450 shares of MJNA @ $.12 cents a share for total
proceeds of $55,374 in cash.


Most Importantly, Who Owns the Public Float? All 252,000,000 Shares Appear To
Have Been Sold To Clueless Retail Investors


After reviewing available public disclosures on current shareholdings, it is shockingly
apparently NO legitimate investors are invested or involved in the Company. Therefore, it
appears Mr. Michael Llamas and Ms. Michelle Sides have honed their prior experience in
mortgage fraud and other criminal activity into a new and more lucrative pursuit: penny
stock fraud. By massively increasing the public float, MJNA appears to have ensnared
hundreds, if not thousands of clueless retail investors.


MJNA Reminds A lot of People of CMKM Diamonds


There is nothing new under the sun. When brought to the attention of several prominent
legal counselors, the MJNA case instantaneously reminded many of them to a firm called
CMKM Diamonds. CMKM Diamonds was also an unsolicited pink sheet and that firm also
purported to be engaged in a very profitable business. However, CMKM Diamonds, like
MJNA, also had a weird relationship between its management and controlling shareholder.


Ultimately, the collapse of CMKM Diamonds cost investors over $100mm that was
eventually traced to the coffers of the management team, which had utilized the proceeds
to buy gaudy real estate and fast cars [shockingly similar to Mr. Michael Llamas prior
mortgage schemes].


In light of these numerous red-flags, we don't believe MJNA's financials and it is our
robust opinion that over time the Company will be proven an obvious fraud.


Conclusion:


After the information we highlighted retail investors should seriously consider exiting this
position immediately and speculative investors should consider a short position. We
cannot imagine why any investors would sit idle and let their hard earned money be
stewarded by the Sides/Llamas Duo. MJNA.PK is, in our view, yet another scheme they
have concocted to steal your money.


In closing we leave you with the "Top 5 Reasons to Sell MJNA Immediately" while this
stock trades at this temporary valuation:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1187411-chronically-criminal-shielding-the-public-from-medical-marijuana 10/97


1. As an unsolicited issuer MJNA has no active market for its shares meaning that
bids or offers can be pulled immediately leading to a potential collapse of the
shares.


2. The so called "Audit" and "Auditor" are in fact not qualified to Audit the
company. As such, none of these purported facts and figures should be relied
upon.


3. The company is run and controlled by a 28 year old fraudster with a terrible
history of financial crimes and devilish ethics.


4. As uncovered by our investigation the company and its insiders have engaged
in fraud by purposely omitting the background information from the disclosures
made on the OTC. This alone could result in a trading halt by regulators.


5. Llamas owning/controlling $1.5mm worth of MJNA shares on behalf of MJNA is
de-facto illegal share distribution. But it also highlights that Llamas is most
probably the guy liquidating the hundreds of millions of undisclosed shares too.


New Information: In addition to all this, we discovered today that PhytoSPHERE
(OTCQB:PHOT), a direct subsidiary of MJNA, paid $100K in cash to bail Michael
Llamas from jail. This was never disclosed as it should have been in the
12/31/"Audit" and is yet another example of fraud perpetrated by MJNA.
