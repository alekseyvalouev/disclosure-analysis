Executive Summary

Spruce Point Reiterates Strong Sell On IRBT And 
Sees 70% - 80% Downside Risk 


Industry Competition Now On Even Footing With iRobot, Pressuring Market Share


• Technological Advantages Dwindling: As the first mover in the robot vacuum space, iRobot has until now enjoyed perceived technological dominance over 
other brands. That advantage has narrowed materially: more established consumer technology brands have entered the market, and consumers have 
taken notice that competitors meet or exceed Roomba’s technological capabilities.


• Amazon Enabling And Promoting Aggressive Competition: Amazon is becoming an increasingly important sales channel for iRobot: it was responsible for 
~25% of iRobot sales in Q3, up from just ~10% in Q3 of the prior year. iRobot products generally do not receive preferential placement on Amazon search 
pages, due to both its high price tag and aggressive promotional activity among peers. Amazon also has less incentive to promote brands with high name 
recognition than do brick-and-mortar stores. Amazon enables a level of competition which undermines the importance of iRobot’s recognizable brand.


• Industry Competition Dragging On Sales Prices: Robot vacuums are classic deflationary pieces of technology: commoditized products which experience 
rapid industry catch-up with each incremental technological development, and which have little room for substantive differentiation (but which require 
consistent R&D spend nonetheless). iRobot has not been able to raise product prices materially for years, and is pushing sales by offering a wider range of 
products priced below its top-line vacuum. This strategy will drag on margins over time.


Troublesome Financial Developments Of Late And On The Horizon


• SODT and Robopolis Acquisitions Set To Lapse: iRobot annual sales growth had fallen to high single-digit levels prior to its acquisition of two distributors. 
New product releases may support somewhat stronger sales growth through 1H 2019, but growth is set to return to prior levels (or lower) as the 
acquisitions lapse. Management has said that it does not see additional acquisition opportunities on the immediate horizon.


• Worrisome Cash Flow Developments: iRobot’s net spending on working capital has ballooned in the wake of its distributor acquisitions – a concerning 
development resulting in YTD operating cash flow contracting by 21% YoY. We believe the financial strain was telegraphed in July when iRobot 
unexpectedly doubled its line of credit from $75 to $150m for no obvious reason, given that it has $126m of cash on hand, and that it was on pace for 
$50m+ of operating cash flow. Rising DSOs may be a signal of channel-stuffing at its own distributors. Massive inventory growth and record DIOs may also 
be both a signal of slowing sales growth ahead and a result of management accumulating lower-cost inventory in anticipation of tariffs. 


• Tariffs Potentially A Highly Significant Drag On Earnings: Management has been dodgy about the potential impact of tariffs when asked about it on calls. 
Investors now have a better sense of the impact of a 10% tariff following the Q3 call, but management continues to avoid discussing the potential impact 
of the impending 25% tariff – perhaps in hopes that the tariffs are cancelled before it would have to do so. We expect iRobot to take a massive 70% hit to 
FY 2019 EPS should the 25% tariff to be instituted on Jan 1 remain in place through the year (barring the passing-on of tariffs cost increases to customers, 
which we feel iRobot has limited ability to do). Sell-side analysts are either ignoring tariff risks or entirely off on the potential magnitude of the impact.


Spruce Point has released a number of reports on iRobot (IRBT or “the Company”) highlighting impending competitive pressures and defensive 


distributor acquisitions designed to forestall revenue growth contraction and margin compression. We have evidence that the competitive forces 


which we foresaw are materializing, resulting in significant ASP declines, market share losses, and cash flow contraction. With the uplift benefit 


from distributor acquisitions set to lapse, and with punitive Chinese tariffs set to expand from 10% to 25% in 2019, we believe that iRobot’s is set 


up for significant revenue growth deceleration, margin contraction, and earnings headwinds next year. As a result, we see 70-80% downside risk.

Spruce Point Reiterates Strong Sell On IRBT In Light Of 
Competition, Cash Flow Issues, And Tariff Risks


Ongoing Concerns Regarding Management And Governance


• Aggressive Company Promotion By Management: Management is aggressive about pushing juicy headlines in the press, drumming up excitement over 
the business and inevitably driving enthusiasm among shareholders who believe that iRobot is truly a high-tech growth company. We saw this most 
recently when iRobot announced a “partnership” with Google: a titillating headline to a story with effectively no material content behind it – yet which 
catapulted shares up >10%, just days after Q3’18 financial results and tariff-related concerns rattled investors and sent IRBT’s share price down by ~10%. 
This isn’t the first time that news of a big partnership mysteriously appeared after iRobot’s shares were hammered after weak financial results. In July 
2017 – shortly after we released our critical update in late June 2017 warning that Shark would enter its market, after which shares fell from over $100 to 
close to $80 – the press reported that Softbank had “reportedly” taken a <5% stake in iRobot that would not require regulatory disclosure, according to 
“people familiar with the matter.” To date, we can find no evidence that Softbank has aided iRobot in any strategic, financial, or operational capacity. 


• Insider Selling Is Exploding Out Of Control: In our first report on iRobot, we noted that insiders were selling the stock aggressively: insider ownership fell 
from ~60% in 2005 to ~12% in 2013 – and then to 5% only a year later. Insiders have continued to be sellers through the last several years, and insider 
ownership is now at an all-time low of 3.5%. While iRobot appears desperate to dangle carrots to the press – in particular, partnerships with big name 
technology companies – its insiders have enacted a record amount of 10b5-1 stock sale programs. For example, in Feb 2017, only CEO Colin Angle had a 
10b5-1 stock sale program in place, but by May 2018 a total of six directors and executives were unloading shares under similar stock sale programs.


• Wasteful Capital Deployment For Share Repurchases: We frequently warn investors to be careful when insiders sell stock while the company is buying 
back shares. iRobot approved a $50m share repurchase in February 2018 and subsequently completed the purchase of 798,794 shares. So what benefit 
have shareholders received from this buyback? The answer: virtually nothing. IRBT’s YTD diluted share count is 28.6m vs. 28.7m a year ago, yielding 
effectively zero EPS benefit – perhaps due to aggressive insider selling. As a mature technology hardware company, we believe that iRobot would have 
better served shareholders with a dividend, synergistic acquisition, or more R&D spending to extend the Company beyond its one-trick-pony Roomba 
product. Instead, we believe management used capital for its own benefit as buybacks supported IRBT shares while executives dumped stock.


IRBT Shares Are A Poor Risk/Reward Proposition And Fully Valued At Current Levels Already Close To The Average Analyst PT Of $100/Share


• Share Price Above Even Lofty Sell-Side Targets: IRBT shares have soared from ~$60 in mid-2018 to close to $100 today, and reached as high as ~$115 
ahead of CEO Angle’s much-anticipated presentation at the Disrupt SF conference – where, yet again, after years of hyping the Company’s potential in 
other home robotics categories, he failed to deliver anything new beyond the stagnant Roomba product. All sell-side analysts remain perennially bullish 
on the Company’s growth story, but the rapid rise in IRBT shares forced some analysts to issue downgrades on the basis of valuation alone. Long-term 
institutional shareholders continue to sell, while those buying classify IRBT under “consumer discretionary” and “homebuilding” and not technology!


• High Valuation, Slowing Growth, Changing Distribution Model And Tariff Threat All Pose Risks To IRBT Shares: We see up to ~50% downside in IRBT shares 
on valuation alone, even when taking consensus earnings estimates for granted. The prospect of slowing sales growth and margin compression would 
imply even more significant downside, and 25% tariffs would wipe out a large chunk of earnings for however long they remain in place. We can envision a 
scenario in which business deterioration and 25% tariffs wipe out all 2019 EPS. Given the fundamental threats to the business, current trading multiples, 
and the possibility that iRobot must bear 25% tariffs for an extended period of time, we value IRBT shares at $20 - $30/sh, 70%-80% below current levels.
6


IRBT Capital Structure And Valuation


Analysts remain overly-bullish on iRobot’s sales and margin outlook, penciling in sustained 16%+ revenue growth and gross 


margins in the 49%-50% range. Accordingly, iRobot trades at a lofty 32x next year’s earnings, far exceeding its long-term average 


of 22x. Our view is markedly different: we believe that its revenue growth rate will flatten towards its pre-acquisition run rate of 9%, 


while gross margins will compress materially from declining unit ASPs (a function of iRobot’s increasing dependence on Amazon


and online distribution more generally) and rising tariff costs. Ecovacs, iRobot’s global competitor, achieves only 36% gross


margins, which represents a good benchmark for where iRobot’s margins may settle once the uplift from recent distributor 


acquisitions lapses.

SharkNinja RoboVacs Now Available Across Wide 
Array Of Distribution Channels, And Taking Share


In June 2017, our report warned that SharkNinja (“Shark”) was primed to come to market with a robot vacuum, citing a recent 


patent filing and recruitment of former iRobot employees, among other evidence. Shark later announced its entry into the market in 


September 2017. As we anticipated, Shark’s established relationships with distributors – both online and brick-and-mortar – appear 


to have allowed it to establish a strong foothold in the market within a short period of time. We noted in our previous report that 


Shark out-innovated competitors and took advantage of its distribution relationships to quickly establish a dominant position 


within the traditional vacuum market,1 and it appears to be repeating itself in the robot vacuum space.

Distributing Shark ION ROBOT Models


Shortly after Shark first announced its robot vacuum in 


September 2017, we identified 11 iRobot distributors which 


were carrying Shark’s new robovacs.


Since then, we have identified another 14 iRobot 


distributors which started to carry Shark robot vacuums. 


One of these distributors (BJ’s Wholesale Club) no longer 


carries iRobot products.


…and this all just one year after Shark first announced its 


robot vacuum.


Note that Shark grew from 1% of the U.S.’s traditional 


vacuum market in 2008 to 20% in 2014.1 It’s not 


inconceivable that it could replicate its performance in the 


robot vacuum market.

Competitive Landscape Becoming More 
Crowded At All Price Points


We noted in each of our prior iRobot reports that increasing competition posed a threat to the Company, which once 


enjoyed an effective monopoly on the robot vacuum market, but which is now just one among many players. At the low 


end, low-cost Chinese products are not only becoming more common, but also more technologically-competent – and, 


importantly, more visible across distribution channels. At the high end, Samsung continues to sell well-regarded robot 


vacuums, and Dyson – whose first robot vacuum struggled to gain traction due to its high price point – announced in 


September that it is releasing its second-generation robovac in China at ¥5,490 (~$800), about 15% lower than the price 


at which its original robot vacuum sold.1


Low-End Competition High-End Competition Speculative Competition


“More recently, we’re getting more competition 


at our entry-level price point and a lot of that 


competition seems to be coming out of China, 


where the products have typically not been 


premium in nature, but they are trying to 


move up the food chain and try to compete 


more aggressively at our entry-level price 


point.”


- Alison Dean – June 12, 2018


“…on the higher end, Samsung has 


consistently been trying to establish 


themselves in North America. It’s a very 


aggressive program in Q4.”


- Colin Angle – Q1 FY 2018 Earnings Call


At every price tier, 


iRobot faces competitors 


offering similar products 


at lower prices


iRobot sells most 


expensive product at 


price tier, but does not 


have superior ratings. 


If anything, its product 


is rated lower than 


competing products.

Competition Is Demonstrably Taking Share


By management’s own admission, iRobot’s market share has been steadily declining through the past several quarters 


– both in North America and globally. Interestingly, management did not provide specific market share data during the 


Company’s most recent earnings call, which it very rarely fails to do.


Alison Dean (CFO):


“We have 88% share 


currently in the U.S. 


market, and the only 


other competitor that we 


would see reported in the 


market data was a 


company called Neato.”

Alison Dean (CFO):


“If you dive down now into 


the actual RVC segment, 


you can see that iRobot 


has maintained a very 


strong leadership position 


across all regions. We 


have an 85% share in 


North America of the 


RVC segment; about 


71% in Europe; and 31% 


in APAC.”


Colin Angle 


(Chairman, CEO):


“In North America, about 


10% of U.S. households 


currently have robot 


vacuums. iRobot has a 


very significant segment 


share in the robot 


vacuuming. In the U.S., 


it's over 80% of the 


robots sold were sold 


by iRobot.”


December 5, 2017


Alison Dean (CFO):


“We think because the 


segment itself, we think is 


going to grow 


substantially, other 


competitors certainly will 


enter the market and I 


think there is growth 


opportunity for all of us. 


Would a share drop a little 


bit with new competition, 


probably, again when 


you're at 88%, there's 


probably only one way 


to go which is a little bit 


down.”

Tail Risk: Amazon Or Google Enters Robot 
Vacuum Market


In recent months, rumors have spread that both Amazon and Google are in the process of developing domestic robots 


as extensions of their home assistant products – Amazon Echo and Google Home, respectively. While neither is 


necessarily thought to be developing a robot vacuum, this hasn’t been ruled out – and, even if they don’t, the release of 


a domestic robot with the AI capabilities of Echo or Google Home would likely limit Roomba’s potential to offer material 


added value as a broader home assistant.

Increasingly Sophisticated Competitors 
Eroding iRobot’s Perceived Premium Status


Management claimed at the Morgan Stanley conference (Sept 2018) that “there really hasn’t been any major new 


competitive offering in the market.” However, we observe that competing products within the premium robot 


vacuum category now offer technological features superior to Roomba’s. If there has been any justification for 


iRobot’s premium price in the past, it has been its (actual or perceived) technological dominance. In just a few short 


years, competitors have matched and surpassed the quality and level of technology featured in iRobot products.

iRobot Appears To Be Playing 
Technological Catch-Up


iRobot’s newly-released Roomba i7+ offers a number of new features unavailable in previous iRobot vacuums. 


However, most of these features have been available in robot vacuums sold by other manufacturers for some time.


Management is notorious for over-hyping and over-promoting the Company’s products and technology (see later 


slides). In reality, there is nothing revolutionary in iRobot’s new vacuum: it is just another robot vacuum with 


features similar to those of other premium-tier robovacs.


Feature Description Notes


“First-of-its-kind” Clean Base 
Automatic Dirt Disposal


Roomba automatically empties dust bin into Clean 
Base after every cleaning. Clean Base can hold the 


equivalent of 30 dust bins.


• Self-service station for robot vacuums first 
introduced by Karcher RC3000 in 2002 (source).


• Available for Ecovacs Deebot R98 since 2012 (link). 
Currently sells online (with self-service station) for 
less than $450 (link - archived). Compare to all-in 
price for Roomba i7+ and stand of $949.99.


Imprint Smart Mapping


On-board camera allows robot to map and remember 
floor area rather than clean in random patterns. 


Permits labeling of individual rooms and creation of 
room-specific cleaning schedules.


• Already available on Neato D7, Ecovacs 930, and 
Dyson 360 Heurist. Was available in Dyson 360 Eye 
as early as 2015.


• Use of cameras rather than laser results in poor 
performance in low-light and no-light 
environments (source).


Direct Command To Clean Specific 
Rooms, Via Voice Or App


User can command Roomba to clean a specific room 
via Alexa or Google. Management claims iRobot to be 
the only robot vacuum company offering this feature.


• Neato D7 supports room-specific voice commands 
via D7 Connected software (source).


• Ecovacs 930 supports room-specific commands via 
user input into app (link).

The Market No Longer Considers Roomba The 
Best Robot Vacuum


Despite iRobot’s claims that Roomba is a premium, technologically-superior product, relatively few tech websites 


cite Roomba as their best-reviewed or recommended robot vacuum, whether on the basis of quality or value.


In fact, Roombas are consistently rated below other robot vacuums not just on value, but also on quality and 


technology. Not only are Roombas not a good value for their premium price, but they aren’t necessarily 


technologically dominant even when price is disregarded.

Ineffective R&D Spending Produces No 
Secondary Products Of Material Value


In our prior reports on iRobot, we detailed management’s struggles to expand the business beyond its signature Roomba 


product. Since our original report, the Company has not only failed to come to market with products which it has been 


planning to roll out for years, but it has failed to grow its other existing product lines to any significant extent, and has cut 


several products from its lineup. The Braava robot mop – iRobot’s only other product line producing anything remotely close 


to material revenue – has also seen limited growth through the last few years.


Business Segment / Product History Status


Defense and Security Business
Launched in 1998. Provided battlefield robots to Department 


of Defense.
• Sold to Arlington Capital Partners in 2016. Now does 


business as “Endeavor Robotics”.


Looj
(Gutter-Cleaning Robot)


Launched in 2008
• Generally met with mixed to poor reviews (example)


• Discontinued in 2017


Mirra
(Swimming Pool Cleaner)


Launched in 2013 as replacement for Verro pool cleaner 
product line


• Currently responsible for less than 1% of iRobot revenue.


TelePresence
Released Ava 500 video collaboration robot in 2013 after 


years of planning and R&D


• Currently responsible for less than 1% of iRobot revenue 
despite heavy promotion by management as a future 
source of growth (see our original report on iRobot)


Scooba
(Floor-Scrubbing Robot)


Launched in 2006 • Discontinued in 2016 in favor of Braava robotic mop


Braava
(Robotic Mop)


Developed by Evolution Robotics 
(acquired by iRobot in 2012 for $74M)


• Responsible for less than 10% of iRobot revenue as of 
FY 2017


• LTM growth in mopping units shipped: 2%


Terra
(Robotic Lawnmower)


In development since mid-2010s. Applied for “Terra” 
trademark in 2014 (source). Received FCC clearance to sell 


lawnmowing robot against National Radio Astronomy 
Observatory challenge in 2015 (source).


• Not available to consumers as of November 2018. 
Management continues to say that they intend to come to 
market with the lawnmower, but have refused to provide 
details or updates on earnings calls.


The only non-Roomba product line currently producing material revenue for iRobot was developed from acquired technology.


iRobot spends ~13% of its revenue on R&D – yet it has produced no secondary products of material value and has done little more than to 


help iRobot tread water with the technological level of the rest of the industry.

Aggressive Competitive Dynamics 
Driving Material Price Deflation
17


Amazon Becoming Increasingly Significant 
Distribution Channel – And Increasingly Competitive


A significant share of iRobot sales growth has come via Amazon through the last several quarters (about 1/3 of Q3‘18 sales 


growth). Recent filings indicate that sales via Amazon have grown 2-3x YoY through the last several quarters (possibly fueled in


part by Prime Day), while growth through all other channels has steadily decelerated. Yet, at the Morgan Stanley conference 


(Sept 2018), CFO Dean said “We don't really look at market share at Amazon” when asked about its significance – a dodgy 


answer at bet. iRobot last disclosed a domestic brick-and-mortar retailer as a significant customer in Q1’17, when it listed Bed


Bath & Beyond as responsible for 10% of sales.1 As management admits, Amazon is a highly competitive platform which 


facilitates competition from sellers which otherwise may have difficulty reaching customers through traditional retail channels,


and which makes product comparisons relatively frictionless for customers. The growing importance of Amazon as an RVC 


distribution channel is a worrisome development.


Amazon searches for “robot vacuum,” “robotic 


vacuum,” etc. generate over 4,000 results from 15 


brands.


A customer would be lucky to find more than two 


brands of robot vacuums at a brick-and-mortar 


retailer (but iRobot would likely be one of them).


Amazon expands the customer’s options and 


effectively increases competition in the space.

Competitiveness Of The Amazon Platform 
Threatens Pricing And Margins


Competition for prime placement on Amazon landing pages is intense and puts downward pressure on margins. Until just several weeks 


ago, close to half of the top hits on an Amazon search of “robot vacuum” were sponsored results, indicating that robot vacuum


manufacturers were aggressively paying for top spots on Amazon’s search results page. Amazon appears to have since cleaned up its 


search results (perhaps in anticipation of the holiday season), but about half of the top results prominently feature discounts of 10-20%.

Competition For Prime Placement On Amazon 
Encourages Aggressive Pricing And Promotion


iRobot management and other sources confirm that placement on Amazon landing pages is dynamic and depends not only on 


sales performance, but also on both price and “investment” – i.e. products which are priced more aggressively, and whose 


sellers pay for higher positioning, are featured higher or more prominently.


iRobot’s premium pricing thus weighs on its positioning on Amazon unless it pays for higher placement. Either way, 


competing for prime positioning on Amazon compresses margins, especially as Amazon becomes an increasingly important 


distributor for iRobot.


“when I go on Amazon.com and just 


filter by vacuum, you guys are seen in 


the 10th spot compared to a lot of other 


retailers where you're the first one to 


pop up. How do you work that 


relationship specifically with Amazon 


and get your gadgets to put number one 


vacuum when you search it, so the 


customers are getting introduced to the 


category and maybe not familiar with 


iRobot, you're the first ones on there.”


- Unidentified Participant


“Okay. So it's unfortunate because you 


sort of – you're making comments, I'm 


guessing, based on recent searches, 


which isn't really indicative of our strategy 


or our normal placement on Amazon 


searches. But Amazon results and their 


searches is highly a function of 


investment as well as performance.


So, you are seeing a function of lower 


price points showing up initially in the 


rankings when you do your searches.


But we do have a very comprehensive 


and aggressive media spend on 


Amazon's marketing platform that will 


normally show a lot of exposure and 


branding for iRobot as well as the 


category.”


- Jennifer Lichtenheim


“Finally, because the Best Seller Ranks 


and Search Algorithms are constantly 


updating, you may drop in search 


results when you are not on sale, and 


increase when you are back on sale.


If this is the case, you are probably 


better off limiting the high-low model 


and moving to a stronger everyday price 


so that you can build momentum in your 


rankings over time and continue to gain 


more reviews.”

Competition For Prime Placement On Amazon 
Encourages Aggressive Pricing And Promotion


• Brick-and-Mortar Stores: Favor name-brand products over no-name brands due to limited shelf space to ensure customer interest, and 


promotes featured products to drive store traffic.


• Amazon: No pressure to feature only name-brand products due to effectively infinite “shelf space.” As an online marketplace with infinite 


shelf space, participates less in the manufacturer’s sales risk when committing space to its products, and therefore has less interest in 


promoting specific products or brands. No-name products may be featured first if they meet SEO criteria more closely – and they often 


do across many, many products. Can monetize competition for top spots on landing pages, benefitting from aggressive competition.


• Exercise For The Reader: Go to Amazon now and search for a product: HDTV, headphones, winter coat, etc. What 


percentage of the first few brands listed do you recognize by name?


Top Results for 


“HDTV” Search:


• Element (4)


• TCL (2)


• Sceptre (2)


• Silver Ticket 


Products (1)


• U Must Have* (1)


• LG (1)


• Hitachi (1)


How many of these 


brands do you 


recognize?


*Also listed as the 


category’s “Best Seller”


The shift away from brick-and-mortar stores in favor of Amazon undermines much of iRobot’s name recognition advantage, 


and levels the playing field between it and smaller players.


Example: HDTVs

Further Evidence That iRobot Does Not Stand 
Out On Amazon


As shown on previous slides, iRobot appears as but one among many robot vacuum competitors on Amazon: it does not have 


prime positioning on Amazon’s landing pages, and its products are given fewer spots near the top than competitors. It is 


included as one of Consumer Report’s “expert picks,” but no more prominently than the others.


iRobot vacs are also outnumbered on Amazon’s Home Gift Guide, the front page of which is prominently sponsored by Shark.

Gift Guide from other pages on Amazon points to this page. The identical URL with “2017” replaced by “2018” points to an error page, indicating that the “2018” page does not exist.

“Smart Home” category, of a 


total of 35 featured products, 


8 are robot vacuums: Neato

The Moral Of The Story:


1. The channel on which iRobot 


depends most for growth is extremely 


competitive and promotional.


2. Any advantage that Roomba carries 


as a known, established player is 


weakened when comparable products 


are pushed aggressively through the 


same channel.

Rising Industry Competitiveness Pressuring 
iRobot’s Pricing


Consumer tech products which feature materially improved technology with each new release, or which benefit 


from customer stickiness / conspicuous consumption dynamics (think iPhones), can manage to support 


progressively higher prices in each successive generation.


Consumer tech products in which material technological advancement is slow, and which benefit less from 


customer stickiness / conspicuous consumption dynamics (think TVs), experience rapid price deflation.


Robot vacuums are much more like TVs than iPhones: they are effectively appliances with only so much room for 


material technological superiority within each product tier. Price deflation is inevitable and already apparent.

The newest Roomba is launching at a price just 5% higher than the launch price of the most advanced Roomba from three 


years ago – and the new price of the i7+ includes the Clean Base tower. iRobot is clearly experiencing significant price 


deflation, and the return on its R&D spend – the backbone of its purported technological advantage – is in progressive decline.


Meanwhile, iRobot is helping to drive growth by offering significant discounts on legacy products, which bring its vacuums 


more in line with pricing across the rest of the space. Driving growth by cutting prices will depress margins over time,

Industry Commoditization And Aggressive 
Competition Driving Material Price Deflation


Aggressive pricing across the industry, combined with the continued commoditization of robot vacuums, is driving 


rapid price deflation among iRobot products. Prices across iRobot vacuums are down as much as 22% between March 


and September 2018 – a span of just six months. This was perhaps due in part to iRobot lowering prices in anticipation 


of the release of the Roomba i7+ and Roomba e5, but it’s notable that prices were down anywhere between 5% and 15% 


months before the new products were to be released (even outside of promotional dates such as Father’s Day).

Average Gross Selling Price Contraction 
Reflects Continued Price Deflation


YoY average selling price changes were generally negative until iRobot’s recent acquisition of two distributors, with 


which average selling prices jumped markedly – something of which we are suspicious. However, QoQ ASP changes 


have been negative outside of acquisition years, suggesting ongoing price deflation when acquisition effects are 


netted out. This held true in Q3 2018 despite iRobot’s new product launches. Management attributed recent QoQ price 


declines and Q2 YoY sales growth deceleration to “typical fluctuations” – a poor explanation in our view.


The Robopolis acquisition will anniversary within the next two quarters. While the new product launches may stave 


off the full force of deflation to some extent in the near term, investors should watch for YoY growth in ASPs to revert 


to its prior trend following the anniversary, barring additional M&A. Management has said that “there is no real low 


hanging fruit” for future acquisitions in any case.

Revenue Growth Slowing Across Geographies 
Ex-One Offs


iRobot’s performance in recent quarters demonstrates clearly that both domestic and international growth are slowing. 


International revenue growth was largely flat before the tailwind from the Company’s two recent acquisitions, and has since 


trended back towards mid-teens levels even before the Robopolis acquisition is anniversaried. Annual domestic sales growth 


had also fallen from ~35-50% to mid-teens levels before the i7+ and e5 were released in Q3. Domestic sales growth numbers 


will likely normalize over the coming quarters.

Cash Flow In Consistent Decline, Driven By 
Growing Working Capital Spending


iRobot cash flow has declined year-over-year in five of the last seven quarters. This has largely been due to changes in working 


capital: CFO before changes in working capital actually grew year-over-year in all but one of these quarters, but outsized spending 


on working capital ultimately drove Net CFO contractions. Cash spending on working capital has increased on a year-over-year 


basis for five straight quarters, and for six of the last seven quarters.


Perhaps telegraphing financial strain, iRobot unexpectedly increased its line of credit from $75m to $150m in July 2018. The last 


time iRobot increased its facility was in 2011 when it increased from $40m to $75m1 The decision to increase the line of credit is 


unusual given that the Company has $126m of cash on hand, and was on pace for $50m+ of operating cash flow. Management has 


also said there are no obvious near-term acquisition targets. DSOs have grown on an annual basis for four straight quarters in 


conjunction with this trend. This is particularly concerning in the wake of iRobot’s recent acquisition of two distributors, which 


gives management opportunities to manipulate performance through channel-stuffing with related parties, etc.

it is unlikely that the acquisitions are responsible for the majority of the growth in working capital spending.

Inventory Ballooning At A Rapid Pace


Of iRobot’s growing working capital spend, its investment in inventory stands out the most. For much of the past five years, 


iRobot’s DIO has ranged between 45-70. Through the last three quarters, its DIO figure has exploded to close to 120.


Again, management blamed the growth in inventory on its recent acquisitions of distributors and new product launches, and 


guided to 100 DIO during the later half of last year. However, according to records filed by iRobot France (formerly Robopolis),


year-end DIO at the subsidiary was just 44 and 54 in 2016 and 2017, respectively. iRobot has also never demonstrated 


inventory growth of this magnitude in front of new product launches before. We do not believe that the acquisitions or new 


products can account for the explosive growth in iRobot’s inventory.

impact of tariffs (see subsequent slides) and forestall gross margin erosion.

Inventory Building At Extreme Pace Not

iRobot’s inventory as a percentage of sales has historically ranged between 30-40% on a quarterly basis, compared to ~40% for 


Robopolis. Yet management tells us that the recent inventory build to >60% of quarterly sales – close to double historical 


levels – can be justified by iRobot’s integration of its distributors.

We are skeptical of management’s justification for its recent inventory build, and suspect that this claim is being used as cover 


so as not to provoke concern among investors regarding the potential effect of tariffs – for which the Company may have been 


preparing by accumulating lower-cost pre-tariff inventory.

Management Growing Inventory To Delay The 
Effect Of Tariffs On Margins?


Through the past several months, Spruce Point has observed that many companies with exposure to Trump administration 


tariffs – both those placed on raw materials and those placed on Chinese imports – have shown inflated DIO through the last 


two to three quarters. We suspect that some of these firms brought forward inventory spending in anticipation of import cost 


hikes – perhaps to accumulate lower-cost inputs, but perhaps to delay the date on which tariffs hit firm margins, or to hold out


from realizing these costs in hopes that the administration would soon reach a new trade deal with China and cancel tariffs.


Vacuums were included on the list of goods to which the Trump administration applied a 10% tariff in late September. Nearly all 


of iRobot’s COGS associated with vacuums sold in the U.S. are subject to this duty, which is to increase to 25% on January 1.


Management has been cagey on the potential impact of tariffs on Company’s margins and earnings. Analysts now have more 


visibility on the impact of a 10% tariff, but management continues to avoid discussing the potential impact of a 25% tariff –


which would probably spook the market at least as much as the 10% tariff did (shares cratered by over 10% following the Q3 


earnings call). We believe that the impact may be drastically more significant than the market currently anticipates.


Q2 2018 Earnings Call


“Our current full-year 2018 financial expectations do not reflect any impact from 


the proposed tariffs.”


“There’s a lot of remaining questions as to exactly what’s going to happen and 


how we will react. At this point, we’re looking at all alternatives.”


- Colin Angle, CEO


Q3 2018 Earnings Call


“I’m not going to speculate as to the financial impact of those tariff 


changes. As we’ve said, our guidance assumes no impact o the tariffs at this 


point.”


- Alison Dean, CFO


“Yes, we really can't comment on 2019 or beyond gross margins at this 


point, Jim. But one thing I think it's worth clarifying is that for Q4 2018, we fully 


took on the burden of those tariffs. That’s $5 million we need moving ourselves 


without any price increases going out in 2018. We’re accepting a lot of 


different scenarios about how to tackle the 25% tariffs if they do take into 


effect on January 1. And a lot of those scenarios do assume some level of 


potentially passing some of those pricing on to the consumers. But we haven’t 


exactly settled on the final answer yet there. But it is likely that our 


expectations that we said in February was not assumed that we carry the full 


burden of the tariff increases.”


- Alison Dean, CFO


“I think that some costs reductions, I mean, are continuous and would impact in 


'19. Longer term things would involve looking at where we manufacture. And it 


looks like we’re in this for the long haul. We have options on that front as well.


We would not materially be able to move manufacturing, and avoid tariffs in 


2019. It would be beyond that before you see a material impact.”


- Colin Angle, CEO


Management itself is not quite sure how it is going to treat the 


tariffs going forward (perhaps just hoping that the 


administration scuttles them?) – and, as a consequence, 


analysts are not quite sure how to model it in.


We believe that this lack of consensus regarding the tariff 


impact has contributed to the recent volatility in IRBT shares.

We Expect iRobot To Miss FY 2019 EPS Consensus 
Estimates By 66% Due To The Impact Of Tariffs


In aggregate, sell-side analysts currently assume little to no material impact from tariffs in their FY 2019 estimates, largely due 


to management’s lack of clarity in quantifying the potential impact of tariffs on FY 2019 results, as well its oblique discussion 


of potential mitigants – all of which, in reality, would be difficult to implement. As a result, analysts are not being diligent about 


assessing the potential magnitude of the FY 2019 tariff impact, and have left their FY 2019 estimates largely unchanged even 


following management’s tariff-related guidance adjustment for Q4.


We therefore believe that IRBT is set up for a significant earnings miss in FY 2019 should tariffs remain in place as scheduled.

Management needs to stop being evasive in response to analyst questions regarding the potential impact of a 25% tariff. The Company is 


very aware of the threat posed by tariffs, as it recently added a risk factor regarding tariffs to its filings. iRobot needs to be more transparent 


regarding these risks, and the sell-side should be more rigorous about assessing the potential tariff impact and resulting downside risk.

Estimate Assumptions And Explanations


Topic Assumption and Explanation


Tariff Timing


• Given DIO between 100 and 120 – with some but not all of this attributable to the impending product launches – and given that some 
of this inventory was accumulated prior to the date on which the 10% tariff was implemented, IRBT had approximately 45-60 days’ 
worth of tariff-free inventory on its balance sheet as of the beginning of Q4. IRBT will feel the full force of the 10% tariff about half-
way through Q4 and will have inventory subject to the 10% tariff on its books going into Q1 FY 2019.


• Inventory expensed in first half of Q1 FY 2019 will have been accumulated during CY 2018 and will be assessed a 10% tariff
• Inventory expensed in second half of Q1 FY 2019 will have been accumulated after Jan 1 and will be subject to a 25% tariff


Inventory 
Subject to Tariff


• ~50% of company sales are into U.S. and subject to tariffs on Chinese inputs
• Per management, effectively 100% of Roombas sold into U.S. are sourced from China. Therefore, IRBT pays tariff on roughly 50% of 


COGS.
• IRBT will not shift its supply chain out of China during FY 2019


• During the Q3 FY 2019 earnings call, management said that it would assess its supply chain for cost savings opportunities, but 
insinuated that changes to its supply chain could not be implemented in the near term


• “…that’s another thing that we will look at the timeframe to implement new actions as a result of supply chain 
initiatives are a little. They’re not as immediate. But that is definitely another piece of the puzzle that we’re assessing.”
– CFO Alison Dean


• As documented elsewhere in this report, IRBT is far too dependent on its Chinese supplier, Kin Yat, to be able to shift its supply 
chain within the coming year


Ability To 
Mitigate Impact 


Through Price 
Increases?


• IRBT will not be able to pass on material share of tariff costs to customer
• Management suggested that it may attempt to increase prices if tariffs extend into 2019, but was noncommittal. We believe 


that, given the competitiveness of the industry, it would have a difficult time raising prices materially without sacrificing
material volume.


Consensus 
Estimates


• Current consensus estimates, in aggregate, do not include material tariff impact in FY 2019
• About half of sell side analysts assume no tariff impact in FY 2019 due to lack of clarity from management on the potential 


magnitude of tariff costs
• Of those who do acknowledge FY 2019 tariffs, most have either minimized their impact due to lack of clarity from 


management, assumed material price increases to pass on tariff costs, assumed lower operating expenses due to supply chain 
adjustments, or some combination thereof


• The aggregate consensus estimate will ultimately have to adjust by the full effect of the tariff should the tariff remain in 
place into FY 2019
Questionable Managerial Decisions 
And Governance Concerns

iRobot Highly Dependent On A Single 
Chinese Supplier


iRobot procures over half of its robot vacuums from a single Chinese supplier, Kin Yat Holdings, and it is estimated iRobot accounts for 40% of 


Kin Yat’s total revenues. We question whether it is wise for iRobot to depend so heavily on a single supplier, which introduces significant risk 


into its supply chain. Given the closeness of the relationship between iRobot and Kin Yat, we also doubt that iRobot would beable to shift its 


supply chain out of China within a reasonable timeframe, and without considerable resistance from Kin Yat. During its Q3 earnings call, 


management suggested that it may be able to reorganize its supply chain in response to longer-term tariffs, but that it wouldn’t be able to do so 


immediately. Many sell-side analysts interpreted this statement to mean that the Company does, in fact, have some latitude to shift its supply 


chain out of China, and subsequently altered their forward estimates to reflect lower operating expenses – even though management explicitly 


said that it would not be able to alter its supply chain within FY 2019. We believe that any such shift in its supply chain would likely take several 


years to accomplish – perhaps longer than the tariffs are expected to last. Accordingly, we doubt iRobot will seriously pursue this route at all.


Kin Yat shares have underperformed the Hang Seng Index by a substantial margin through the last twelve months, with all of these relative 


losses coming since the Trump administration announced its current tariff policy. The market clearly anticipates that demand for Kin Yat 


products will be down, that its customers will search for other suppliers, or some combination thereof. iRobot, however, is unlikely to be 


able to find another supplier in the near-to-medium term. IRBT investors should be concerned that the market is signaling expectations of 


depressed demand for Kin Yat products.

Beware: Evidence Points To Promotional 
“News”, At Convenient Times Post Sell-Offs


iRobot aggressively pushes promotional press releases with little material content. As a high-growth “tech” company, buoyant 


announcements often get material traction among investors. However, there is little substantive content behind most of them.


Two recent news stories catch our attention in particular. In July 2017 – shortly after shares fell from over $100 to close to $80 


following our report warning of SharkNinja’s entry into the RVC market – rumors spread that Softbank had “reportedly” taken a <5% 


stake in iRobot that would not require regulatory disclosure, according to “people familiar with the matter.” We have no way of 


confirming whether this investment was in fact made, and wonder why SoftBank would want to drive its cost of acquiring shares 


higher if it hadn’t already purchased them. To date, we can find no evidence that Softbank has aided iRobot in any strategic, 


financial, or operational capacity.


More recently, on October 31 of this year – just a week after shares plunged >10% on Q3 earnings – iRobot announced a 


collaboration with Google through which the companies would “seek additional ways to integrate their platforms.” There was no


material content to this announcement aside from this entirely speculative message – nor any suggestion of how this partnership 


might be monetized – yet shares jumped ~10% on the release, and have continued to climb since.


At best, growth-oriented IRBT shareholders are extremely responsive to speculative, yet empty, news stories which superficially bode well 


for the Company. At worst, we wonder whether management uses the press as a means to support investor sentiment.

Distributor Acquisitions Look Increasingly 
Suspicious In Light Of Cash Flow Developments


As noted, iRobot’s acquisition of two of its distributors give management potential opportunities to engage in related-party 


transactions which flatter performance figures. For example, management could engage in channel-stuffing to inflate sales figures, 


or could artificially raise prices on sales to its distributors to inflate ASPs.


For this reason, we have become increasingly suspicious of iRobot’s recent acquisitions in light of the Company’s recent cash flow 


and ASP developments. Why did ASPs suddenly spike in the two quarters during which iRobot’s acquisitions were completed, only


to continue their downward trend in each quarter thereafter? Why have DSOs grown since the acquisitions were completed? Why 


have inventory levels ballooned so precipitously? Again, management blames the latter on new product launches, but against the 


backdrop of DSO expansion and ASP inflation immediately following the distributor acquisitions, we question this explanation.

Increased Insider Selling With Pre-Arranged 
Programs Since Our Last Report


iRobot insiders have shown a general disregard for our pointed criticisms, and could have reacted by purchasing shares to 


increase its commitment to the business. Instead, management has continued to sell stock at an accelerated pace.


The Company’s 10b5-1 safe harbor statement (buried at the bottom of its SEC 10-K/10-Q filings) has gradually expanded since 


February 2017 – when it included only CEO Colin Angle – to include CFO Alison Dean and three other insiders, revealing that the 


number of insiders who have been disposing of shares is growing.

Insider Ownership Now Lowest On Record


In 2014, we noted that insider ownership had declined precipitously since the Company first went public in 2005 – particularly 


between 2013 and 2014, when insider ownership fell from 11.8% to 4.9%. Insider selling has continued since then, and is now 


down to  a record low of just 3.5% as of March 2018.

With Just 9% Implied Upside, IRBT’s Shares 
Are A Terrible Risk/Reward


IRBT shares have had a schizophrenic year, trading down significantly after the Q4 FY 2017 call on disappointing FY 2018 


guidance and after the Q3 FY 2018 call on tariff-related concerns. Shares have since traded up nonetheless, primarily on the 


Company’s announcement of new products which are not materially more advanced than the competition, and on its 


announcement of a nebulous, potentially unmonetizable partnership with Google. As previously discussed, many analysts have 


also failed to take the potential magnitude of the FY 2019 tariff impact into account – and some have even raised FY ’19 


estimates due to their outsized confidence in the mitigating strength of management’s price and cost levers.


Shares have risen so drastically over the course of the year that a number of sell-side analysts have been forced to revise their 


recommendations from “Buy”/“Outperform” to “Neutral”/“Market Perform” simply because the market caught up to their lofty 


price targets. None have taken a materially lower view on their respective outlooks for the Company going forward.

“The CEO expects tariffs to put moderate pressure on the overall RVC 


category, and IRBT is aligning its product mix and pricing accordingly. We had 


previously believed that IRBT would look to increase US pricing by the full 


amount of the tariffs in 2019, essentially passing on the tariff cost to the 


customer; however, based on management commentary, we believe that is 


just one of several options….We now look for FY19E GAPP EPS of $2.90

iRobot’s Valuation Comparisons


As we discuss in our original report on iRobot, we believe that it should be valued against other consumer electronics and 


household product companies. While iRobot has grown at a faster pace than has its peer set, and while it shows relatively 


higher margins, we believe that neither its growth rate nor profitability is sustainable through the near term, for reasons given 


throughout this report.


Despite this, IRBT shares trade at a 65-100% premium to peers across various valuation metrics. We do not believe that this 


premium is justified.

IRBT Should Trade At A Discount To Ecovacs


Some will argue that IRBT should trade on par with Ecovacs – arguably its closest comp – and that this justifies IRBT’s 


premium valuation against other consumer technology hardware companies listed on the prior slide. However, we note several 


important differences between iRobot and Ecovacs, which suggest that IRBT should trade at a relative discount. The market 


should not anchor IRBT to Ecovacs, which it may currently be doing.

1. iRobot’s Growth Profile Is Lower Than Ecovacs’


• As a dominant player in Asia and a lower-priced alternative in North America, Ecovacs is growing at a much faster pace than iRobot. 


Ecovacs is taking global share by iRobot’s own admission.


• Meanwhile, iRobot’s underlying sales growth is closer to a high single-digit rate, the growth rate that it posted prior to its recent distributor 


acquisitions. We expect iRobot’s growth rate to revert to this level over the coming quarters.


2. iRobot’s Gross Margin Advantage Unsustainable In An Increasingly Commoditized Industry


• As noted throughout this report, the robot vacuum industry has shown material price deflation through the past several years – a pattern 


which should continue. iRobot’s premium price will inevitably fall closer to Ecovacs’ current price level.


• iRobot’s alleged image as a “premium” product is only so durable when product features across brands are so similar, and when


technological catch-up between competitors is so quick. Consumers will inevitably gravitate to lower-priced options when products are 


technologically similar (recall the rise of non-premium branded TV companies like Vizio through the late 2000s and early 2010s).


• Ecovacs has structural cost advantages: not only is its manufacturing based in China, but so is the rest of the company and its personnel.

We See Significant Downside In IRBT On Valuation 
Alone, And Regardless Of Tariff Outcome


We see close to 50% downside on IRBT from current levels on valuation alone: even if consensus estimates are correct, multiples on 


FY ‘19 are far higher than they should be. Valuing IRBT at its peer group multiple on consensus estimates, less full-year tariff costs, 


implies a share price 83% below current levels. At the extreme, when we take tariffs into account on our own FY ‘19 projections for 


IRBT, we arrive at an estimated $0 EPS for the year: a full year’s worth of scheduled tariffs would wipe out all IRBT earnings.


However, though we believe that some analysts are not taking the threat that tariffs last through the year seriously, and though we 


believe that tariffs should be taken into consideration when valuing IRBT, we also acknowledge that tariffs will likely not last forever 


– and, even if they did, iRobot would inevitably adjust its supply chain accordingly. We feel comfortable valuing IRBT between our 


“No Tariff” valuation and our “Half Year Tariff” valuation, using our own estimates for the business.

How We Think About IRBT’s Multiple


Valuing IRBT at close to $30 per share may seem extreme given the stock’s current price. However, we remind investors that 


IRBT traded at close to this level for nearly four years before the stock ran up suddenly and precipitously in 2016. iRobot was of 


course a smaller company then, but it demonstrated much stronger organic top-line growth, its growth trajectory was much 


clearer, and the sustainability of its gross margins was less in doubt. At present, iRobot’s normalized top-line growth rate is 


closer to high single-digit levels when acquisition effects are netted out, and margins are coming down from pricing pressure as


a result of increased online (Amazon) sales and tariffs. 


IRBT has historically traded at around 22x one-year-forward EPS – at the high end of our comp range, but within the comp range 


nonetheless. We therefore give IRBT some benefit of the doubt in our valuation and value it in a range between 17x (the 


midpoint of our comp range) and 22x (its historical forward earnings multiple, and the high end of the comp range).
