LDK’s financial irregularities


are evident and highly


material.


Investors should be highly suspicion of LDK Solar Co., Ltd.’s


(“LDK”) announcement with Q-Cells. The convoluted alleged


transaction with a supplier would raise eyebrows even if


announced by a company whose entire lifetime earnings


record has not been seriously questioned. LDK hasn’t


disclosed complete �nancial statements for over 11 months.


LDK’s reported earnings were suspect even before it went


public. LDK had no sales in 2005 or the �rst quarter of 2006.


And then, presto, it started claiming pro�ts almost from day


one of sales. It’s not as if LDK invented anything new. Or that


it bought an existing pro�table business. It’s a start up. And


it’s a start up commodity supplier in a highly competitive and


well established industry.


LDK reported net income of $25.9 million in 2006. Yet even


by KPMG’s own reckoning its operation actually used $57.1


in cash during this same period. LDK claims to have earned


$48.3 million in the �rst half of this year. LDK has not


provided investors with a cash �ow statement for this


period. This, and all other LDK reports, and LDK itself, are


under investigation by the SEC.

LDK’s expense capitalization and asset valuation


investigation relate to the capitalization of over $200 million


in expenditures as assets, instead of expenses, in just the


�rst six months of this year. This �gure is multiples greater


than LDK’s entire claimed lifetime earnings.


Simpson Thacher & Barlett LLP, working for an LDK


committee of two LDK directors, has hired Deloitte Touche


Tohmatsu to investigate LDK. Yet LDK has publicly dismissed


this alleged independent review. This public dismissal of the


alleged “Independent Committee” and its advisors had led


investors to believe that the investigation, including the


Securities and Exchange Commission investigation will be


resolved shortly and be resolved positively. (Click here to


read related letter to Simpson Thacher.)


LDK’s accounting irregularities have prevented LDK from


releasing any �nancial statements since June 30, 2007.


Investor should understand that even those June statements


were incomplete and only in the form of a press release


without company certi�cation or footnotes.
