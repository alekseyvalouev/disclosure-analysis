Curiouser and Curiouser


We posed a number of questions for ACM Research (ACMR) before its Q3 results, but the quarter report just deepened the mystery.
Our biggest question is why ACMR seems so cash-starved when the 
company reported a cash balance of $92.2 mln in Q3 2020 and a posi-
tive operating cash flow. Nevertheless, the company took on new debt 
specifically to fund short-term working capital. Q3 2020 short-term 
debt rose from $25.8 mln in Q2 2020 to $28.3 mln.


Meanwhile, interest income earned from cash balances took a peculiar 
fall. Interest income earned during Q3 2020 was just $179,000 com-
pared to end-period cash balances of $92.2 mln, a dramatic fall rela-
tive to the $320,000 in interest earned in the previous quarter, when 
end-period cash balances were lower, at $86.4 mln. In Q3 2020, the 
company incurred an interest expense of $272,000, far higher than in-
terest earned. That emphasizes how strange it is that cash should co-
exist with debt. Unexplained discrepancies related to interest earned 
on cash balances are a well-known red flag.


The company now has a total of 15 different lines of credit, 14 from 
mainland China banks, of which 10 bear personal guarantees by CEO 
David Wang. No debt is collateralized or guaranteed by the company’s 
assets on Mainland China, where the principal operations are located. 
This is highly unusual. If assets are real and unencumbered, why is 
the company unwilling to use Mainland China assets, including cash 
or subsidiary guarantees, against primarily Mainland Chinese debt 
obligations? Why the need at all for these lines of credit?

It could be dismissed as a coincidence that at end Q3 2020 the 15 different 
lines of credit happen to equal the estimated number of 15 delivered but 
not paid-for machines, apparently sitting at customer premises waiting to 
be paid for some day if they feel like it, whenever…..


“Since 2009 we have delivered more than 120 single-wafer wet 
cleaning and other front-end processing tools, more than 105 of 
which have been accepted by customers and thereby generated 
revenue to us and the balance of which are awaiting customer ac-
ceptance should contractual conditions be met.”


Yet quarterly trends also show a strong correlation between lines of credit 
value compared to finished goods inventory by value. Despite this correla-
tion, the company has not disclosed that this mysteriously finished inventory 
was used directly or indirectly as collateral to obtain bank loans. This inven-
tory is not located at the company warehouse for the auditors to physically

check, nor are there tax receipts or cash transactions for auditors to verify, 
because no sale has been booked. Cash balances could easily be used instead 
of debt. If this difficult-to-verify inventory has been collateralized, it cannot 
be sold without great difficulty. If it exists only notionally for the purpose of 
gaining bank loans, it either cannot be sold or it hides substantial losses. 


Disclosures in the most recent quarterly filings shows ACMR can take on 
part of the “working capital” debt through gold leasing. Since we don’t un-
derstand this esoteric form of credit, we spoke with Chinese bankers from 
Ping An Bank and ICBC. They said this form of credit is fairly common 
among miners and jewelers but rare for industrial companies. A Ping An 
gold-leasing specialist told us that manufacturers who use gold leasing are 
either speculating on the price of gold—if it declines, you pay less for the 
loan—or bulking up their balance sheets.


“If you make semiconductor cleaning equipment,” the banker said, “the 
gold you secure for leasing becomes your inventory. It’s really a trading 
security, but no one can tell it apart from other inventory. It does not show 
up as debt. It’s purely a way to fatten the balance sheet.”

The gold leasing provision is yet another reason to doubt that ACMR ac-
tually has or can access the $92.2 mln it claims to have in cash. ACMR 
filings define Party A as China Merchants Bank, and Party B as ACM Re-
search (Shanghai).


Some other issues:


 ‣ ACMR gifted $18 mln to a group of related parties, including some-
one who is the company’s largest sales agent and a major supplier. 
The Q3 2020 report includes an agreement granting 242,681 war-
rants at $7.50 each for shares in ACMR to Shengxin (Shanghai) 
Management Consulting Limited Partnership (SMC). The shares are 
currently trading at $82.

 ‣ ACMR again made extensive new disclosures to Shanghai regulators 
and failed to inform U.S. investors. Among the details that readers of 
Chinese learned:


• ACMR inflates its gross profit margin by foisting production 
costs off on the R&D budget. There are several ways in which 
ACMR hides costs. One key manner is to charge raw materials to 
the R&D budget. In a document submitted to Shanghai regula-
tors, ACMR reported that some materials for machines, which 
are always customized, are paid for on the R&D budget. On page 
8-1-1-208 of the company’s recent responses to Shanghai regula-
tors1 entitled “Regarding R&D Expenses,” ACMR reported that 
¥18.7 mln in raw materials in H1 2020, 5.3% of revenue in the 
half, were charged to the R&D budget. Adding these materials to 
cost of goods sold in H1 would have lowered gross margin from

46.7% to 42.2%. If the purported R&D expenses were added to 
COGS for Q3 2020, as we believe they should be, gross margin 
would drop by 20 points. There are other suspicious charges to 
R&D, such as direct labor, that inflate margin. We also suspect 
that ACMR may be using this R&D ruse, along with demo tools, 
to avoid paying VAT, thus boosting profit margins further but 
risking penalties, a reversal of this strategy, and unwelcome 
regulatory scrutiny on its proposed STAR IPO listing.


• The STAR company and ACMR US have adopted rules to keep 
ACMR US from “making use of the issuer’s funds.” This provides 
an added layer of certainty that U.S. investors will not be able to 
access any profits that could come from the Shanghai subsidiary, 
where 98% of ACMR’s business takes place.


• The company responded to J Capital’s detailed report only to 
claim that all its disclosures are accurate.


ACMR continues its tradition of giving equipment away to customers and 
letting them pay if they feel like it. The company reports that 12.5% of 
equipment delivered since 2009 has not been paid for:


Using a “demo-to-sales” process, we have placed evaluation equip-
ment, or “first tools,” with a number of selected customers. Since 
2009 we have delivered more than 120 single-wafer wet cleaning 
and other front-end processing tools, more than 105 of which have 
been accepted by customers and thereby generated revenue to us

ACMR helpfully specifies that this “pay if you feel like it” equipment is 
counted as finished goods inventory: “Finished goods inventory represents 
‘demo-to-sales’ product which have been delivered to customers for evalua-
tion.” (Q3 2020 earnings presentation page 8) CFO Mark McKechnie speci-
fied on the earnings call that the inventory uptick in Q3 was for demo tools.
