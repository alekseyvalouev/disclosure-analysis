Sphere 3D is a recent assembly of four money-losing companies.


The majority of the company's valuation is linked to its "Glassware 2.0"
virtualization software.


I believe the company is setting up for disappointment with material downside in the
share price possible, if not likely.

Most companies can only dream of having their products become verbs (like Google),
become so entrenched in consumers' lives and minds that their brands can define whole
categories (think "Kleenex" or "Band-Aid"). However, it can go too far in countries like
the U.S., in which companies risk losing their "generic trademarks" if not properly
protected. "Zipper" is an example of a brand formerly owned by B.F. Goodrich Company
but available for anyone to use now. But what really gives product managers the sweats
is when their wares are suddenly and inadvertently associated with a horrible event.


In November, 1978 cult leader, community organizer, and all-around nutjob Jim Jones
led a mass murder/suicide of over 900 people via cyanide poisoning mixed with flavored
drink crystals. Ever since, the term "drinking the Kool-Aid" has been used to refer to:


"a person or group holding an unquestioned belief, argument, or philosophy without
critical examination. It could also refer to knowingly going along with a doomed or
dangerous idea because of peer pressure."


The term is often used by short sellers to describe those on the other side of a trade.


Unfortunately for Kraft Foods, the producer of Kool-Aid, society does not seem to care
about the fact that it was most likely not Kool-Aid, but its cheap competitor "Flavor-Aid"
that wiped out the poor souls at Jonestown.


Given the huge run in speculative equities we've had over the past several years,
especially in tech and biotech, it's not hard to find legions of Flavor-Aid sipping touts
around most speculative, risky, and highly valued stocks.


Sphere 3D Corp (NASDAQ: NASDAQ:ANY) is no exception.


I've been following ANY since it was a penny stock on the Toronto exchange. 18 months
ago. Between July 2013 and July 2014 ANY's share price rose over 1,700% as shown
below (this chart ends on December 10 2014 as it moved to the NASDAQ exchange
following its merger with Overland Storage):

The share price has been volatile over the past two quarters, bleeding from the $9 range
in November down to the mid $3s before rebounding sharply to $7.50 on the back of
some announcements, stock newsletters, blog posts and investor conferences, and now
fading down into the low $5s. It seems I'm not the only one having a tough time trying to
pin a value on this company.

The Initial run from penny-stock land to a double-digit share price was purely on the
back of hype surrounding the company's "Glassware 2.0" virtualization technology.
While the share price went up 10x between July and December 2013, revenue was
literally zero. More on that later.


Company Description


Sphere 3D today is really a collection of four companies that have been slammed
together over the past 12-18 months. In March 2014, the company acquired Utah-based
V3 Systems Inc. for $9.7 million in cash and stock. Two months later, the company
announced a merger with Overland Storage (former NASDAQ Ticker OVRL). While the
headline Overland deal value was $81 million, it was a stock swap and a notional 53%
premium over the prior day's trading price. Overland itself merged with another
company, Tandberg Data, in January 2014.


I'll get into the four "businesses" later, but for now I'll simply regurgitate how the
company is describing itself this week:


"Sphere 3D Corporation is a virtualization technology and data management
solutions provider. Our portfolio of workload-optimized solutions address the
complete data lifecycle continuum, from active data to data at rest. Dedicated to
continue to lead through innovation, Sphere 3D enables the integration of virtual
applications, virtual desktops, and storage into workflow, and allows organizations to
deploy a combination of public, private or hybrid cloud strategies."

Tandberg Data ASA was a Norway-based publicly traded supplier of tape backup
solutions. In 2006 (9 years ago) faced with a market in secular decline and stiff
competition, it agreed to acquire competitor Exabyte. To fund that acquisition Tandberg
turned to New York-based Cyrus Capital Partners, a distressed lender. Please keep
Cyrus in mind as they are now the single largest shareholder (and creditor) of Sphere
3D.

Tandberg's business continued to circle the drain and Cyrus put the screws to Tandberg
the following year:

Yada yada yada things got progressively worse and by April 2009, the company had
filed for bankruptcy and was owned by Cyrus Capital in a debt/equity swap.


Between the time that Cyrus was handed the keys to Tandberg and it announced its
merger with Overland in 2013, the business had shrunk from over $170 million in
revenue to $60 million, and that includes revenue from an acquisition (RDX, a
removable disk drive vendor) made in 2011.


The Overland Storage / Tandberg merger proxy statement paints rather painful picture
of Tandberg, and has interesting details on how Overland and Tandberg came together.
Tandberg continued to lose money. In 2011 the company had a $3.9M operating loss on
$80M in revenue. In 2012, revenue shrank to $68M and operating losses swelled to
$7.5M. Losses were actually accelerating into the merger, with an operating loss of
$6.7M on revenue of $29.7M (a $59.7M run rate) for the six month period ended June
2013. Naturally, Cyrus had to make frequent cash injections into Tandberg. By June
2013, Cyrus had pumped in an additional ~$40M ($50M with interest):

Discussions between Overland, another storage vendor, and Tandberg (i.e. Cyrus)
began in mid-2012, after Overland sued Tandberg for patent infringement. Perhaps
Cyrus saw a potential solution to its Tandberg problem. Naturally, they started pumping
cash into money-losing Overland Storage as well, injecting $14M into Overland in
February 2013 and resuming merger "discussions" with Tandberg.


"If you've got them by the balls, their hearts and minds will follow" 
- Theodore Roosevelt


My sense is that it didn't take much convincing to get Overland to agree to a merger with
Tandberg. By June 2013, it had only $7M in working capital with quarterly losses over
$5M, and Cyrus, as owners of OVRL's debentures, were pushing for it and were a
source of desperately needed cash. It was even making interest payments with shares.

The companies announced the merger in October 2013 and it was completed in
January 2014. Before closing, the Cyrus ATM machine kept on spitting out cash with a
$3M injection in November 2013, $2M in December 2013, and another $2M in January
2014.


Overland wasn't exactly putting on a financial clinic itself. Here are Overland's revenues
from 2005 to 2013:

And finally, the share price (take a guess as to how it looks - no peeking!):

One cheeky reporter referred to the prospect of Overland merging with Tandberg in the
following way:


Source: The Register


When the Overland/Tandberg merger was announced, the companies put out a
presentation outlining what the combined companies would look like (see here). Amidst
the usual puffery, they offered up the "fiscal expectations" below:

Unfortunately, Overland merged with Sphere 3D before the end of December 2014 so
we'll never get to see the official 6-month number for Overland. However, a recent Form
51-102F4 gives some nice insight into how things were going in the back half of 2014
over at Overland. Below are the Q3 2014 Overland results:

So instead of positive EBITDA and 34-38% gross margins, we had roughly negative
$6M in EBITDA (operating loss adding back depreciation), a 27.7% gross margin, and a
revenue run rate (Q3 X 2) about 20% less than forecast.


Naturally, Cyrus continued to make it rain, shoveling another $7.5M into Overland to
cover losses while the company pursued a merger with Sphere 3D.

I realize I've skipped around here a bit, and haven't talked much about Overland
merging with Sphere 3D, but I think the Overland/Tandberg history is important
background, especially as the Overland/Tandberg business will account for nearly all of
Sphere 3D's near-term revenue. There are also overlapping timelines, as Sphere and
Overland were in discussions as far back as 2012.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/3/8393471_14272321157541_13.png

The SEC-filed Form F4/A (found here) describes the history of Sphere's discussions
with Overland. Around the time (2012) Overland initiated discussions with Tandberg and
before Sphere's IPO, "actively engaged shareholder" (and soon to be Sphere CEO)
Peter Tassiopoulos approached Overland CEO Eric Kelly about the possibility of
Overland acquiring Sphere 3D. That is interesting, as during the fall of 2012 Overland's
average market cap was under $40 million with negative working capital as of
September 30, 2012.


Only seven days after Sphere completed its reverse merger and became public on
December 21, 2012, it entered into a non-disclosure agreement with Overland for the
purposes of pursuing a "potential strategic transaction." The companies could not agree
on the terms of a merger (and it is clear that Overland's discussions with Cyrus and
Tandberg took precedence), but were able to come to a commercial arrangement in July
2013, including a modest $500K mutual stock and cash swap. Overland CEO Eric Kelly
also became Chairman of Sphere 3D. Kelly received options for 850,000 shares of
Sphere (equal to roughly 5% of the company at the time). Discussions continued.


While Overland and Tandberg (i.e. Cyrus) were looking to merge, and Sphere was in
strategic discussions with Overland, things became even more convoluted when V3
Systems Inc. was introduced into the mix.


Sphere's F4/A confirms that V3 was on the mat, when just days after signing a letter of
intent to acquire the assets of V3, it had to start fulfilling V3's orders according to an
"informal" agreement due to "V3's inability to fulfill orders directly due to lack of funding":


Source: Sphere 3D F4/A


Of course, Sphere itself with zero revenue (for the quarter ending December 31 2013),
$700K in quarterly operating losses, and only C$5.6M in cash wasn't exactly in a strong
financial position either. Naturally, they turned Cyrus Capital Partners for a $5M
convertible note which allowed them to close the V3 asset purchase.


While Sphere was closing V3, Overland (having blown through the latest barrel of Cyrus
bucks) was locked in negotiations for a toxic preferred share financing with an unnamed
"Potential Lead Investor":

The fact that Overland was even entertaining such a toxic financing speaks volumes
about the dire situation the company was in. Furthermore, it signals (at least to me) that
Cyrus Capital, having pumped yet another $7M into Overland just a few months prior,
could no longer be relied upon for endless bailout scrilla.


Not surprisingly, Overland CEO (and newly-minted 850K option havin' Sphere 3D
Chairman) Eric Kelly approached Sphere CEO Peter Tassiopoulos:

The companies then quickly hammered out an agreement and announced the merger
on May 15, 2014. Cyrus could finally take a deep breath, as rather than being asked to
pony up again, the company was able to raise $10M in an underwriting led by Cormark
Securities, the firm that on the very same day provided a $200,000 fairness opinion to
Sphere 3D on the Overland transaction, and received a $600,000 "success fee" for
"other advisory services", according to filings.


The transaction closed on December 12, 2014. And that, my friends, is a much-
truncated history of how the four companies that form "Sphere 3D" came to be. The
timeline below may help:

I haven't even really touched on what these companies do yet. I'll try to be as brief as
possible and spend a little more time talking about the Sphere 3D "Glassware 2.0"
contribution to mix, as that is where the bulk of the company's valuation (and hype)
comes from.


Overland / Tandberg is a storage business, providing tape backup (remember those?),
removable drives, network-attached storage (NAS) and storage-area network (SAN)
solutions. The following slide from the merger presentation gives a sense of the product
and revenue mix:

Source


Tape backup and tape automation systems are in secular decline (see here for data).
Overland and Tandberg both came from the tape world. As I noted earlier, Tandberg's
revenue declined from $170M in 2009 to $60M by 2013, and Overland's revenue was
cut in half over the same period (see earlier chart).


As the tape market really started to head south, these companies were forced, for
survival reasons, to enter the network-attached storage (NAS) and storage area network
markets. However, these are ferociously competitive markets with little margin to be had
on the low end, and a high end dominated by players like EMC and NetApp. NetApp
alone spent over $900M on R&D last year (vs. about $6.2M for Overland). While
Overland's slides put on a brave face and "vision," the constant organic revenue
declines and ongoing losses paint a more realistic picture, in my opinion. Pre-merger,
Overland's gross margins were in the 28% range. This compares to NetApp and EMC in
the 63% range.

http://www.sccg.com/tapetracker.html
The closest surviving comparable company I can find to Overland/Tandberg is the #1
tape player from yesteryear, Quantum (NASDAQ: QTM). When Tandberg acquired
Exabyte in 2006 (and raised that first round of capital from Cyrus), it touted that the
combined company would be the "clear number two in its markets behind Quantum."
Quantum has suffered as well, with revenue "only" down about 30% from 2009 levels,
but its much larger scale (2009 revenue of $800M) and higher margins (~40%) have
allowed it to eke out the occasional operating profit and invest in R&D to the tune of
about $70M per year. It currently trades at about 0.75x EV/sales.


A review of the Glassdoor.com site gives some insight into how employees viewed the
company (see here), which seems to fit with the narrative I've outlined above.

V3 Systems is (was) a Utah-based provider of "Virtual Desktop Infrastructure" or "VDI"
solutions. Desktop virtualization is software technology that separates the desktop
environment and application software from the physical client device used to access it,
allowing for easier deployment, management, security, etc. Citrix and VMWare are
major players here. V3 System' main product was an appliance (i.e. physical server)
running VMWare virtualization software as described in this VMWare / V3 Case Study
from 2012 (please ignore the prediction of 2012 revenues of $25- $30M, ahem). A more
recent (2013) "reference architecture" is found here.

V3 also added its proprietary "Desktop Cloud Orchestrator" software to the appliance, to
ease deployment and management. This YouTube video from 2012 provides some
flavor (not Flavor-Aid!):

For whatever reasons (e.g. execution problems, disappointing VDI market growth,
competition from much larger players) meaningful sales were not generated and the
company was about to hit the wall when Sphere 3D scooped up the assets for $4M in
cash and about $5.7M in Sphere 3D stock (excluding a potential earn-out up to $5M).
The court filing below shows that in November 2013, just before Sphere 3D signed a
letter of intent to acquire the assets of V3, it had retained legal counsel to advise on
"bankruptcy, workout, dissolution, and restructuring options."

This 2011 article from desktop virtualization guru Brian Madden predicted challenges for
the company that may have played a role in V3 running out of runway:

With Overland, Tandberg, and V3 out of the way (albeit briefly), we are left with the one
remaining component: Sphere 3D's "Glassware 2.0" virtualization technology. If you are
looking for some basic primers on emulation and virtualization of servers and
applications, you can find them here and here. Some information from major players in
application virtualization space (in which Sphere 3D hopes to compete) from VMWare,
Citrix, and Microsoft can be found here, here, and here.


It's difficult to find detailed information on "Glassware 2.0". There are no detailed
whitepapers, technical specs, etc. It also seems to have morphed somewhat over the
past couple of years. Archived versions of Sphere 3D's website give a sense for how
little they disclosed. Below are some screenshots from the company's website circa
December 2013:

Not exactly bristling with detail, is it? And Fortran is a programming language, not an
operating system - wouldn't a software company know this?


Note the comment on hardware emulation above. A search for the company's patent
applications reveals they are primarily emulator related:

Emulation, which recreates hardware in software (while consuming a meaningful
amount of computing resources) is not new or novel. The first known emulator dates
back to 1941 when the British used the Colossus computer to emulate the German
Enigma machine. There are 33 subcategories of emulation software on Wikipedia.


In 2012, 2013 and 2014 Sphere 3D's press release and filings often used the term "full
functionality of any software program or application on any device, anywhere." I
am personally excited about running my 1985 version of Lotus 1-2-3 on my Apple
Watch. Any device right? With full functionality? Sphere 3D's website still makes similar
references:

The real world is a bit different. For example Apple's licensing terms for products such
as its OSX operating system allow it only to be legally installed on Apple-branded
hardware:

That didn't seem to stop the company from using the MacOS logo in investor
presentations (see here). Just because something may be technically feasible, doesn't
mean you can do it legally.


Of course there are technical and practical limitations as well (e.g. that mainframe app
written in 1985 may not understand the swipe gestures on your Kindle Fire).


The company has more recently provided some high level architectural diagrams:

So we know Glassware 2.0 runs on top of Windows 2008 and 2012 Server. A lot of the
functionality that enables application virtualization are built natively into Windows Server
(and thus Microsoft's cloud platform, Azure), including App-V and RemoteApp:

One of the purported advantages to Sphere's approach is that applications are
"containerized," in that rather than being combined with a full copy/instance of an
operating system, the container only includes the application and the pieces of the OS
needed to run the application. Thus in theory there should be some efficiency gains vs.
older approaches.


Sphere 3D claims (see here) that it's "microvisor" (slang for micro hypervisor) allows
direct access to GPU (graphic chips, important for image-intensive applications) while
"Hypervisors prevent direct access to the hardware. All access is made through virtual
drivers which are cumbersome at best and do not work at worst." It seems that
statement is a stretch. Below is information from Nvidia, a major GPU supplier partnered
with giants Citrix and VMware:

Containers are not new. A quick primer and brief history of containers from VMware can
be found here. The clear leader in container technology, which is being adopted widely,
is Docker, an open-source (i.e. free) platform. You can read more about Docker here
and here. Docker is backed by Yahoo! Founder Jerry Yang, Benchmark, Greylock,
Insight, Sequoia, and others. Over 95,000 applications have now been "Dockerized" and
it has been downloaded over 200 million times. It has been deployed at companies like
eBay, Baidu, Yelp, and Spotify, and has integration partnerships with Amazon Web
Services, Google, Cloud Foudry, IBM, Microsoft, VMware, and many others. Microsoft
announced recently that it is bringing Docker to the Azure platform.


For more discussion on Glassware 2.0, this article in The Register isn't bad, which talks
about some of the practical realities of the software. You can also find interesting
discussions in the comment section of various Seeking Alpha articles on ANY.


From my perspective, what is important to know is that Sphere 3D is entering a
virtualization market dominated by major players (e.g. VMWare alone has a $1.2 billion
R&D budget). If I had to bet on a "containerization" winner, it would be Docker. To me it
seems Glassware's opportunity set will be confined to small niches, where the market
opportunity is so small that it's not worth a software vendor's time to upgrade (or
Dockerize) their software to support a new platform (this will be less and less of an
opportunity with cloud-based SaaS apps), or for customers that deploy new
unsupported hardware ( e.g. Chromebooks) and need access to the niche applications
either until the vendor upgrades the software or they move to the new version. In my
opinion this is far from the sweet spot of the virtualization, cloud, and container wave
that is going on.


A perfect live case study, and seemingly the first real world deployment of Glassware is
what the company did with Corel.


In September 2013, Sphere 3D announced a public beta for an iPad version of Corel
Office:

http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/27/sphere_3ds_mini_microvisor/?page=2
I'm not exactly sure what happened along the way, but it seems the office suite never
got released, and it was whittled down to WordPerfect only in an official launch 11
months ago in April 2014:

So how has the Glassware 2.0-powered WordPerfect iPad app been received? A quick
look at App Annie is instructive. Below are the customer reviews stats for the current
and prior versions of the product:

I don't recall ever seeing a score this bad. 75% of the users rated it 1 out of 5 stars.
However, reading the actual reviews gives some insights into how well "Glassware 2.0"
is unleashing all of that functionality. Here are the first 10 reviews:

I asked Corel about the product. They confirmed to me in writing that the product would
be pulled at the end of February. Note how they now refer to it as a "test" (compare that
to the language in the launch PR above). Below is a screen shot of what Corel was
happy to tell me over Facebook:

Corel was touted as an important relationship by Sphere 3D. What started as a full
virtualization of Corel Office, became WordPerfect only at launch, and is resulting with
the app being pulled down?


An oft-touted (by ANY longs) "customer win" is that of Chesterfield Country Public
Schools, a large (top 100 in U.S.) public school system in Virginia covering 58,000
students and 63 schools. In May 2014, CCPS announced that it was purchasing 32,000
Dell Chromebooks to be issued to students. At the time of the announcement, Sphere

The Chesterfield deal was also highlighted in a recent bullish Seeking Alpha article on
Sphere 3D (found here):


"Then there is the Chesterfield County School district, with a whopping 32K
Chromebook implementation. Guess what they are using to still be offering legacy
Windows apps? Yes, Glassware 2.0."


I'm a bit of a nosy fellow when it comes to investing my savings. I don't necessarily
accept what I am spoon-fed. I like to test and verify. Some call this "due diligence" but I
call it "common sense." As an investor I've spent a fair bit of time making requests under
the Freedom of Information Act and equivalent statutes (e.g. at the state level). Not only
does Virginia have the Virginia Freedom of Information Act, but Chesterfield County has
an "Open Government" initiative to promote "transparency and openness."


Conveniently, Chesterfield County provides access to all vendor payments made by
CCPS. Initially, I was interested in what kind of revenue Sphere 3D might be receiving
from this deal. It was easy enough to find payments to Dell totaling over $3.8M in FY
2015 to date - a partial sample is below:

However, I could find no payments whatsoever to Sphere 3D or V3 Systems. That
raised an eyebrow. I then thought that, perhaps, Glassware 2.0 was being provided
through Dell. After all, Dell is a partner of Sphere. I was easily able to locate the Dell
contract (thanks Chesterfield County for your openness!) found here. No reference at all
to Sphere 3D or V3, and the words "virtualization" and "Windows" do not appear.
Hmmph.


I then started skulking around the CCPS Chromebook website that describes what is on
offer to students:


Source


I could find no mention of Windows apps ("legacy" or otherwise) being made available to
Chromebook users. In fact, the only reference I could find to Microsoft at all was the
following:

I then decided to do something rather outrageous. I asked them. You see that little "Ask
a question" form on the screenshot above? So inviting.


I was frankly a bit shocked by what I learned. CCPS is not using Glassware 2.0, nor is
there any deal with Sphere 3D. Straight from the Manager of Instructional Technology at
CCPS:

So this is what ANY longs have been waving around for the past 9 months? And why
was Sphere's Chief Strategy Officer tweeting about this? Why did it take me spending
30 seconds to fill out a form on a CCPS website to learn this? As recently as Friday, the
"How To Find Big Stocks" newsletter touted "testimonials" from CCPS. Speaking of
"How To Find Big Stocks," here is a screen capture of Sphere 3D's "Media" section of its
website circa December 2013:

To be fair, another school district, New Caney ISD in Texas has confirmed that it will be
using Sphere 3D to some extent (see here). It's not 100% clear what Windows
application (or applications) is being virtualized by New Caney. A recent presentation
mentions iStation, Microsoft Office, and TestNav 7.5 as being required for
Chromebooks. New Caney IT Director Dustin Hardin's blog correctly points out that
Microsoft Office Online runs on Chromebooks (it is a web app). iStation may have been
an issue, but just released a Chromebook app. That would leave TestNav 7.5, an online
testing system that is not compatible with Chrome OS. Indeed Sphere 3D recently
became certified with TestNav and is one of many virtualization providers that can
provide TestNav 7.5 on Chromebooks:


Source


It's interesting that VMware View and Horizon can also provide this functionality, in that
these VMware products are the backbone of the V3 Systems VDI appliance.

http://www.testnavqualified.com/
It should be noted that while TestNav 7.5 is not compatible with Chromebooks without a
virtualization solution, TestNav 8 is, as shown here. Thus, it seems to me that New
Caney is (or is planning on) using Glassware to allow the older version of TestNav to run
on its own new (Chromebook) hardware, perhaps until it upgrades.


Circling back to Chesterfield County, I came across the following article from January:

The above article also contains the following insight into CCPS's decision process:

It's not clear how Sphere 3D won the New Caney ISD business (e.g. price, performance,
or both). However, it does point out some limitations of the market that Sphere is going
after. If a new hardware platform (e.g. Chromebooks) takes off, software vendors will
upgrade their software or create apps to run on such a platform (just like it didn't take
iStation or TestNav long to come out with Chromebook-compatible software), limiting the
need for virtualization. Some organizations may not be able to move quickly to the next
version (e.g. New Caney ISD and CCPS) so may have some demand for a bridging
solution from Sphere 3D or one of the many other virtualization vendors. Niche
opportunities may also exist for more esoteric needs. It's also a reality that the more
applications (and customers) move to the cloud with software-as-a-service /SaaS apps
(with a simple browser interface) the less need to emulate other hardware or older
software.


The company put out an "open letter to shareholders" on February 17. It included what I
view as a virtually (pardon the pun) worthless financial update:

Given the Overland merger closed on December 2, there was nearly a full month of
Overland revenue included in that update. The company did not provide a split between
the Overland, V3, or Glassware 2.0 businesses. Overland did $23M in revenue in the
quarter prior to the merger (a $7.7M monthly run rate) so we can safely assume most of
that revenue came from Overland. No bottom line or EBITDA updates or estimates were
provided. I view the "goal" of an annualized run rate of $160M+ in Q4 2015 as having
little informational value, especially give CEO Eric Kelly's history of missing expectations
at Overland.


I noted the disappointing 2H (at least to Sep 30 2014) results after the Overland /
Tandberg merger earlier. Going back further, here are some quotes from Overland CEO
Eric Kelly taken from transcripts as early as 2010 when he became CEO at Overland:

The above guidance is interesting as, like Sphere 3D's recent business update, in
February Mr. Kelly was providing expectations for the fourth calendar quarter. So how
did things turn out in 2012? Fourth quarter calendar 2012 revenue actually came in at
$12.6M (44% below the midpoint of the estimate).

EBITDA for the quarter ended June 30, 2013 was negative $4.6M.


You'll forgive me if I leave that $160M cup on the picnic table for now.


Others have raised questions about the company, management's credibility, and track
record (see here, here, here, here and here).


With so many moving parts, it's difficult to put a value on the "new" Sphere 3D. How do
you value a shrinking, cash burning storage business that hasn't turned a profit since
2005? How do you value an appliance vendor that was on the verge of bankruptcy?
How do you value a virtualization software business with negligible revenue? I'll take a
stab, for what it's worth.


First, below is the current capitalization of the company:

For the Overland/Tandberg component of the business, I am going to use a value of
$65M. I get there two different ways. First, the enterprise value immediately prior to the
announcement of the Sphere 3D merger was about $60M. As a reality check on that
number, Quantum (company in the same market, with larger scale, a lower decline rate,
and higher margins) trades for 0.74X EV/Sales. Applying that number to Overland
annualized sales for the quarter ending September 30 2014 (the latest available -
$91.6M run rate) I get about $68M. Split the difference and call it $65M for
Overland/Tandberg.


For V3, I'm arbitrarily going to use $10M. Sphere paid $4M in cash for this asset plus
some highly-valued ANY paper with a notional value of $5.7M, so I'll round up from
there and use a $10M figure.


I get to about $75M for Overland and V3 (I personally think Overland is worth far less as
I have little optimism for future profitability). That leaves upwards of $140M in value
being ascribed to "Glassware 2.0". Given the modest amount of traction to date, and
seemingly (in my opinion) fumbling badly on the Corel implementation, I view that as
extremely rich.


Revenue from Glassware in 2013 was literally zero, and negligible for 2014. Total
revenue for Sphere in the first 3 quarters of 2014 was only $4.4M, and that not only
includes V3 revenue, but per the recent filings it seems some or all of $2.2M had to be
reversed between Overland and Sphere as "elimination of intra entity transactions." And
given that $2.2M reversal had a COGS of $1.1M (50%), we can assume it was mostly
hardware related anyway. Perhaps the 2014 audited financials will clarify.

If Glassware 2.0 is worth $140M, it would have to go down as one of the biggest returns
on R&D dollars in history. According to the company's annual report, it spent less than
$30,000 on technology development in 2013, down from $42K the prior year. Canadian
dollars.

Of course, a portion of $1.4M in "salaries and consulting" may related to R&D, but per
the notes about $581K of this was share-based payments to management and directors.


In my opinion, if Sphere 3D (ex Overland and V3) showed up at a VC with a handful of
early customer wins, little revenue, and the Corel experience, they would be lucky to get
a $10M pre-money valuation.


As a sample of how well "Glassware 2.0" needs to do to justify my calculated implied
value of ~$140M, if one assumes that in 3 years Glassware will be valued at VMware's
high EV/Sales multiple of 4.95x, and using a discount rate of 35%, and assuming no
additional dilution or cash needed to get there, ANY would need to be doing ~$70M in
trailing 12-month revenue, in 36 months.

Some may quibble with a 35% discount rate, however I would note that Sphere 3D itself
is using a 35% discount rate for valuing the potential earn-out on the V3 Systems
transaction. A 20% rate equates to $49M in year 3 Glassware revenue (from a current
level of near zero). And again, under the unrealistic assumption that additional capital
raises and are not required to get there.


In my view a bet on Sphere 3D here is a bet that a) the storage business can at least
stabilize and not continue to be a cash sucking black hole of perpetual disappointment
(my opinion - and I have trademarked that phrase so don't even think about using it),
and b) that Glassware is on the cusp of major revenue and traction. A school board or
small win here or there just won't cut it. The company talks about how these pieces fit
together ("hyper converged cloud infrastructure!"). Maybe they are right, but I tend to
know marketing gobbledygook when I hear it.


I am skeptical that they will be able to stabilize the storage business (a decade of
continuous losses and negative organic revenue means something to me), and I'm even
more skeptical that Glassware and V3 will enter into a massive and sustained revenue
ramp, albeit with sporadic deal announcements here and there.


Trying to come up with a specific valuation is tough. I view Overland as the most
valuable piece of the bunch (it seems Sphere exec Peter Tassiopoulos agreed, wanting
to sell out to Overland in 2012 when Overland had a $40M market cap and negative
working capital. If I use my $65M Overland value as the upper bound for what
Glassware is worth, my crude sum-of-the-parts would equate to:

That wouldn't strike me as unreasonable, if I were three pints into the Kool-Aid already.
It's not a stretch in my opinion to say that there are some catastrophic downside
scenarios as well. If the Overland business stays true to its heritage and continues to
bleed and Glassware/V3 don't take off in a big way, the company will be in a tough spot,
with a "zero" not out of the realm of possibility. And Cyrus, a distressed debt lender,
would be owed nearly $20M. Ask the old Tandberg Data shareholders how that situation
worked out for them.


Upside dreams are only a spreadsheet away, so I'll leave those scenarios to the
analysts and ANY bulls. I could be wrong.


My sense is the retail investor base expects results, and fast. That could be a problem if
the company stumbles. In addition, my hunch is that Cyrus Capital, 9 years into a series
of ill-performing loans is looking to recover as much of its past losses as it can and
move on. My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that along the way that have sunk
about $80M into these businesses. After 9 years what they have to show is a $19.5M
debenture from Sphere and about $30M "worth" of Sphere 3D stock. I would love to
read their investor letters on the matter over the past 9 years. As an owner of 5.9M
Sphere 3D shares, that is a significant potential overhang (at average trading volumes
of 390K and being 25% of daily volume it would take about 3 months to move). With an
insider on the board it would be hard to do. If I had to speculate, I would think that what
they are looking for is a nice pop in the stock so the company can raise capital and they
can move a block on a secondary basis. But I am speculating here.
Another overhang may come from Pinetree Capital which owns about 2.8M shares
(recently "retired" former Pinetree CEO Sheldon Iwentash owning another ~1M shares).
Pinetree is a distressed public investment company that is in default on its debt and
creditors that have stepped in. While not a fire sale, the forbearance agreement with the
creditors calls for large cash payments on the debt:

My guess is that they will be trying to sell everything that isn't nailed down as soon as
they can, and that could include its large holdings in Sphere 3D. Pinetree's portfolio is
bristling with private and illiquid junior companies, about half of which are in the
resources sectors. Below is a stale snapshot (Sep 30) of their portfolio:

On balance, it seems like a great time to be short Sphere 3D, if one can stomach the
volatility. I first started writing this article when ANY was in the $7 range a couple of
weeks ago. Even though it has declined to the low $5s, I still see a lot of potential
downside over the medium term.


As a potential sign of desperation about the company's share price, Sphere just
announced a CUSIP number change and small name change (from "Sphere 3D
Corporation" to "Sphere 3D Corp."). Unless this is somehow related to the Overland
merger (e.g. merging with the acquisition subsidiary they set up to do the Overland
deal), this is a tactic used occasionally by paranoid microcaps to lash out at nefarious
"naked short sellers" by forcing share certificate exchanges and reconciliation of share
locates. If so, I view it as a major sign of weakness, as nothing would "burn the shorts"
more than executing on the business. If they are devoting management time and
attention, and shareholder cash, to "the shorts" it may serve more as a dinner bell than
a warning for prospective short sellers. The company was silent on the reasons for this
change, but it reminds of New Wave Mobile (now delisted) that put out this PR in 2007:

I wrote an article on the topic of overblown concerns with naked short selling (found
here) if you want my opinion on the topic.


As for what happens to the stock price, it is difficult to predict as I think it is already
decoupled from reality. I am not a buyer at any price.
