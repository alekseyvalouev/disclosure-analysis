Marubeni	(8002):	
The	Writedowns	Have	Awoken!		 	 	 	 	 April	18,	2016	
	
	
NEWS:	For	the	second	year	in	a	row,	Marubeni	Corp.	revised	down	its	profits	by	more	than	
¥100	bn	plus1,	driven	by	¥70	bn	in	impairments.	Today’s	announcement	by	the	company	
shows	that	two-thirds	of	the	company’s	profit	for	this	fiscal	year	ending	March	2016	was	
likely	wiped	out	due	to	one-time	losses	in	the	fourth	quarter.	The	bulk	of	this	year’s	
revisions,	which	total	¥120	bn,	is	in	commodities,	which	account	for	63%.	The	top	
writedown	at	¥35	bn	is	in	the	Chile	copper	business.	Marubeni	reports	its	annual	results	for	
the	FY2016	on	May	10.	
	
COMMENT:	As	our	Dec.	18,	2015	report,	“Marubeni:	The	Writedowns	Awaken”	forecast,	the	
company	has	had	to	impair	its	assets	to	reflect	the	massive	drop	in	commodity	prices.	We	
estimated	impairments	of	¥150bn-200	bn	and	for	Marubeni’s	stock	to	drop	40%	to	¥390.	
The	shares	dropped	to	¥496	in	February	from	¥625	at	the	time	of	our	report,	and	we	fully	
expect	the	downward	trend	to	continue.	
	
However,	today’s	writedowns	do	not	draw	a	line	under	the	matter.	Marubeni	has	waited	
until	its	larger	peers	among	Japanese	traders	post	their	own	results,	but	it	cannot	hide	from	
the	fact	that	its	commodity	investments	are	in	many	cases	inferior	to	peers	as	they	were	
completed	at	the	peak	of	the	market.	
	
In	this	sense,	seeing	a	mere	¥20	bn	impairment	on	iron	ore	in	Australia	(the	same	material	
that’s	seen	its	price	shrink	to	a	third	of	its	2011	peak),	is	bewildering.	We	ran	Marubeni’s	
Roy	Hill	stake	through	peer	comparison,	DCF,	and	multiples	valuations	and	all	showed	a	loss	
of	at	least	double	that	size	and	more	likely	triple	and	higher.	
	
Marubeni’s	losses	from	the	Gavilon	asset,	which	despite	being	a	grain	company	is	
ingeniously	listed	as	a	non-resource	business,	is	buried	together	with	profit	declines	in	steel	
products.	To	remind,	Gavilon	is	an	asset	for	which	Marubeni	booked	¥125	bn	in	goodwill	
after	the	purchase	in	2013.	Meanwhile	the	grain	company	has	failed	to	meet	a	single	annual	


																																																								
1	FY2016:	http://www.marubeni.com/news/2016/release/201604186.pdf	and		
			FY2015:	http://www.marubeni.com/news/2015/release/00002.pdf

profit	target	set	for	it	by	Marubeni	up	to	now.	Last	year’s	¥50	bn	writedown	of	Gavilon	can	
hardly	be	enough	and	the	profit	decline	warning	is	surely	the	start	of	more	impairments.	
	
Earlier	this	year	Marubeni	kicked	out	3	top	executives	at	Gavilon	and	said	that	the	business	
needs	a	radical	overhaul.	We	agree,	and	think	this	should	start	with	a	more	sincere	attempt	
at	Gavilon’s	valuation.
