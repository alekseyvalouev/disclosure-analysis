Afrezza is a rapid-acting, inhaled insulin for the treatment of diabetes.Afrezz


The hedge fund manager who has already made a killing betting
against biotech company MannKind Corp. now says the stock will soon
be worthless.


"After 14 weeks of a disastrous drug launch and with much more data
and research, we now believe that MNKD will go to ZERO," Jason Karp
and his $2.5 billion Tourbillon Capital Partners wrote in a May 5 letter to
investors obtained by CNBC.com.


Karp is referring to the recent rollout of Afrezza, MannKind's signatureAfrezz
diabetes treatment product. Afrezza's innovation is the ability to inhaleAfrezz
insulin as opposed to injecting it. The drug has a licensing agreement
with pharmaceutical giant Sanofi. It's in the early stages of its
commercial launch.


The new, more negative thesis rests on what Tourbillon called low levels

notion that Afrezza could do better than break even in a few years; aAfrezz
notion that is becoming increasingly far-fetched."


A spokesman for MannKind did not immediately respond to requests
for comment. Amy Zipper, Tourbillon's chief operating officer, declined
to comment.

CNBC.com reported in July that Tourbillon was short and had a $1 price
target on the then-$10-a-share company.


"Only in a frothy, retail-driven (and now Tweet-driven) market can a
stock like MannKind exist with a $4.3 BILLION valuation and in our view
no clear prospects of revenue," Karp wrote at the time.


The stock has fallen more than 57 percent since late July to $4.15 a
share today.


Matthew Pfeffer, MannKind's chief financial officer, has already strongly
contested Karp's thesis.


"We think it's a much improved, next generation product," Pfeffer told
CNBC.com in July.


Hakan Edstrom, MannKind's president and CEO, said in February that
the product was just beginning to hit the market.


"With our flagship product, Afrezza, in the early stages of itsAfrezz
commercial launch in the United States, we now enter a very exciting
new phase for MannKind," Edstrom said in a statement along with 2014
financial results.

Tourbillon's main fund has performed well. It's up 8.26 percent net of
fees this year through April, according to the letter. The fund also
gained 10.05 percent in 2014.
