Prescience Point believes that shares of Celadon Group (“CGI”, or “the company”) are grossly 
overvalued, failing to reflect the likelihood of an imminent debt restructuring and wipeout of 
existing shareholders. 
 
In April 2017, Prescience Point issued two research papers  (the “Initiation Report” and the 
“Follow-Up Report”) on CGI.  In our Initiation Report, we concluded that CGI’s profits and TBV 
were highly overstated in its SEC filings and that the company was at the precipice of bankruptcy.  
In our Follow-Up Report, we revealed that the company was the subject of an undisclosed 
investigation by the SEC’s Enforcement Division.   
 
In the prevailing 9 months since we released our reports, CGI’s auditor BKD withdrew its audits 
of CGI’s financial statements; CGI’s top 3 executives were replaced; CGI disclosed an active 
formal SEC investigation; and, CGI violated its debt covenants and would have already declared 
bankruptcy if not for the generosity of its lenders who have amended the credit agreement three 
times since May. 
 
Unbelievably, despite all of the challenges and uncertainties facing CGI, its share price has almost 
quadrupled over the past few months from a low of $1.55 on May 3rd to the current share price 
of $6.35.  Investors appear to believe that, with new management in place and the recent 
improvement in the trucking environment, CGI is in the midst of a successful turnaround. 
 
However, we continue to believe that CGI is a Zero, and that bankruptcy is the most plausible 
outcome, for the following reasons: 
 


• After generously amending the credit agreement several times, CGI’s lenders appear to 
have finally lost patience.  In the most recent amendment dated September 29th, a 
clause was added requiring CGI to refinance its existing credit facility by December 31st.  
If CGI fails to do so, it appears that its lenders are now prepared to force the company 
into bankruptcy in order to preserve the value of their collateral. 
 


• CGI’s refinancing efforts appear to be on the verge of failing.  As of November 30th, the 
company had yet to receive a satisfactory LOI for its proposed term loan, and had only 
managed to secure a non-binding LOI for its proposed ABL which is subject to due 
diligence.  Non-binding LOIs are far from firm commitments as evidenced by Bank of 
America’s decision to walk away from its proposed $225m ABL with CGI earlier this year 
after conducting due diligence.  Also, based on the cautious tone of CGI’s latest 
refinancing update, it appears that management is losing confidence in its ability to 
refinance on acceptable terms for shareholders.

• In addition to the ongoing financial restatements and SEC investigation, we believe that CGI’s difficulties in attracting interest 
from lenders is also attributable to its dire financial condition.  Our research indicates that CGI’s already poor operating 
performance has further deteriorated in the 3+ quarters since it last reported earnings.  For example, CGI has communicated to 
investors that it expects to report a net loss of $10.0m in Q3’17, as well as a net losses for FY’17 and Q1’18.  Additionally, the 
minimum LTM EBITDAR covenant in the latest credit agreement amendment – $76.4m, $71.0m and $67.0m for the periods 
ended 9/30/17, 10/31/17 and 11/30/17, respectively – suggests that CGI’s LTM EBITDAR has declined significantly since Q2’17.  
Lastly, although CGI’s rampant asset liquidations have helped keep it afloat in the short term, these dispositions will greatly 
pressure the company’s revenue and profitability going forward.  Consider that the recently sold Quality business accounted for 
$12.8m of annualized operating profit in Q2’17. 
 


• In our Initiation Report, we concluded that CGI’s last reported TBV of $10.80 per share as of Q2’17 is mostly fiction.  In total, we 
estimated CGI’s accounting shenanigans had inflated its Q2’17 TBV by $219m, and that CGI’s actual Q2’17 TBV was no more 
than $.42 per share.  Recent evidence has confirmed that CGI’s reported TBV is significantly overstated and is likely worthless, in 
our view.  For example, Element has written down its JV stake by almost 50% over the past 3 quarters, supporting our 
conclusion that the $100m JV stake on CGI’s balance sheet is likely worthless.  Additionally, according to CFO Thom Albrecht, 
BKD is reassessing the accounting for around 11,000 equipment transactions, indicating that significant equipment write-downs 
are likely.  Lastly, CGI’s continued operating losses will result in further reductions to its TBV. 
 


Even if CGI is somehow able to refinance and remain solvent, we believe CGI shareholders will still incur significant losses.  In order to 
effectively run its business, CGI will need to substantially reduce its debt balance which stood at $455.3m as of Q2’17.  With access to the 
equity markets likely cutoff due to a lack of audited financials, we believe that the company will need to exchange more than $250m of its 
existing debt for equity in order to reduce its debt to a target leverage ratio of 2.0x LTM EBITDAR.  Given that current TBV appears to be 
worthless or close to it, we estimate that such a debt-for-equity swap would be priced at no more than $1.00 per share – diluting existing 
shareholders by at least 90%! Thus, all roads appear to lead to a disastrous outcome for shareholders. 
 
We hope that current and future investors and creditors familiarize themselves with the risks we have addressed and take immediate 
action to preserve the value of their holdings.

Developments Over the Past Nine Months Have Validated Our Research  
 
Since we published our initial short recommendation on CGI almost nine months ago, a number of developments have transpired which 
have either confirmed or reinforced many of our key research conclusions.  These developments include the following: 


 
• BKD withdrew its audit reports: In our Initiation Report, we concluded that CGI would restate its historical results due to the 


myriad of accounting improprieties we highlighted.  On April 25th, this prediction came true as BKD withdrew its audits for CGI's 
FY'16, Q1'17 and Q2'17 financial reports.  In a subsequent press release on October 2nd, CGI indicated that it did not expect 
BKD's audit work to be completed until sometime after 12/31/17.  In our view, the lengthy amount of time it is taking for BKD 
to complete its work indicates that CGI's financial reports are likely to be restated significantly. 
 


• CGI replaced its top 3 executives: In our Initiation Report, we presented evidence that CGI management had not only 
fabricated CGI’s financials, but had also used a related party (19th Capital) to enrich itself at the expense of shareholders.  In 
the months following our report, CEO Paul Will, COO Eric Meek and CFO Bobby Peavler were all let go and replaced by the 
company.  In our view, this swift cleaning of house by CGI confirms that the concerns we raised about management’s conduct 
have merit. 
 


• CGI’s liquidity issues have intensified: In our Initiation Report, we concluded that CGI would be insolvent in 1-2 quarters due to 
its deeply negative and rapidly deteriorating FCF and limited revolver availability.  Since we published our report, CGI’s liquidity 
issues have intensified.  The company has been firesaling assets and recently raised $22.6m in term loan financing in order to 
keep itself afloat.  CGI also violated its debt covenants, and its credit agreement has been amended three times since May.  If 
not for the generosity of its lenders, CGI would have already declared bankruptcy.  
 


• CGI revealed that it is the subject of a formal SEC investigation: In our Follow-Up Report, we revealed FOIA data confirming 
that CGI was the subject of an ongoing SEC investigation.  We concluded that this investigation would result in enforcement 
actions against CGI and its management team.  CGI verified our findings when it disclosed on October 2nd that the SEC had 
undertaken a formal investigation related to the company.  Public companies are only required to disclose SEC investigations 
that they deem to be "material."  The fact that management judged this investigation to be serious in our view indicates that 
future enforcement actions are likely. 
 


CGI’s Refinancing Efforts Appear to be on the Verge of Failing 
 
Since BKD withdrew its audits in April, CGI’s lenders have generously amended the credit agreement a total of three times as they have 
patiently waited for the company to get its financial house in order.  However, it appears that their generosity and patience is wearing 
thin as the sixth and most recent amendment contains a new clause requiring CGI to refinance its current $221m credit facility by 
December 31st, indicating that they are now willing to let the company fall into bankruptcy in order to preserve the value of their 
collateral.   
 


Section 6.02 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new clauses (w) and (x) to such 
section: 


(x) on or before November 22, 2017, a certificate signed by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower confirming that the 
Borrower has paid the necessary due diligence or similar upfront fees required under one or more letters of intent 
executed in connection with a prospective transaction or transactions that would enable the Borrowers to repay in 
full all Obligations under the Loan Documents on or before December 31, 2017. (Sixth Amendment to Credit 
Agreement, Pg. 4, 9/29/17)

Thus, CGI must refinance its existing credit facility in short order, or else it will almost assuredly have to file for Chapter 11.  Unfortunately, 
despite months of effort, the company has made little progress in securing new lenders, and based on the cautious tone of CGI’s 
November 30th press release, it appears that management is losing confidence in the company’s ability to do so.  These developments 
have led us to believe that CGI’s refinancing efforts are on the verge of failing and bankruptcy is the most plausible scenario.  
 
CGI Has Made Little Progress in Securing Lenders for Its New Credit Facility 
 
Over the past few months, CGI has been scrambling to raise money for a newly proposed credit facility consisting of an ABL and a term 
loan.  According to management, the ABL will be smaller than the current credit facility, meaning that the company will need to close 
both the ABL and term loan in order to successfully complete the refinancing.  The bad news for CGI shareholders is that, with the year-
end deadline just days away, the company does not appear to be close to closing either: 


 
• Although CGI recently signed a letter of intent (“LOI”) for its proposed ABL, the LOI is non-binding and subject to completion 


of due diligence: In its November 30th press release, CGI disclosed that it had signed an LOI for a proposed ABL with two of its 
existing lenders. 
 


In particular, we have entered into a nonbinding letter of intent which contemplates an asset based revolving credit 
facility with two of our existing revolving lenders.  (CGI Press Release, 11/30/17) 


 
However, in the same press release, the company noted that the LOI it received was non-binding, and that the closing of the 
ABL was subject to further diligence, internal lender approvals and negotiation of definitive documents.  Therefore, although 
signing an LOI represents some incremental progress, CGI appears to be a long way away from closing on the ABL as many 
hurdles still need to be cleared.    
 


The proposals are non-binding and the completion of the refinancing is subject to, among other things, the prospective 
lenders' satisfactory completion of due diligence, internal lender approvals, and negotiation of definitive 
documentation.  (CGI Press Release, 11/30/17) 


 
Also, as disclosed in its May 1st press release, one of CGI’s current lenders – Bank of America – provided CGI with a term sheet 
for a proposed $225m ABL back in May.  At the time, the company disclosed that it expected the facility to close by the end of 
June.  However, the ABL never closed as Bank of America apparently walked after further diligence.  We believe there is a good 
chance that the lenders who signed the current LOI will also do the same after digging deeper into the company. 
  


• CGI has not received any satisfactory LOIs for its proposed term loan: Prior to its November 30th press release, CGI had last 
updated investors on its refinancing process in a press release on October 16th.  In this update, the company disclosed that it 
had received indications of interest (“IOIs”) for both its proposed ABL and term loan: 
 


The Company has received the required indications of interest…In particular, two members of our current bank group 
proposed asset-based revolving credit or similar facilities consistent with our requested terms…In addition, we received 
indications from multiple term lenders to accompany the revolving facility, with terms being consistent with our range 
of expectations.  Based on these indications of interest, which are non-binding, we continue to expect to refinance our 
existing facility with a more appropriate long term capital structure.  (CGI Press Release, 10/16/17) 


 
Over one month later, in its latest refinancing update on November 30th, CGI disclosed that it had signed an LOI with two of its 
existing lenders for its proposed ABL.  However, no mention was made of signing an LOI for its proposed term loan, indicating

that the company had yet to receive a satisfactory LOI from potential lenders.  The fact that CGI had yet to receive a 
satisfactory LOI as of November 30th was further confirmed in a conversation with CFO Thom Albrecht.  
 


In particular, we have entered into a nonbinding letter of intent which contemplates an asset based revolving credit 
facility with two of our existing revolving lenders.  This continued support from our current lenders is much appreciated 
as we continue to work towards accomplishing the refinancing.  (CGI Press Release, 11/30/17) 


 
So why has CGI failed to attract a satisfactory LOI for its term loan?  Some of the lenders who submitted IOIs may have dropped 
out after further diligence.  Others may have submitted LOIs that CGI rejected due to unsatisfactory terms.  Regardless of what 
happened, the simple fact is that CGI’s attempts to attract serious interest for its term loan have largely failed. 
 


Has Management Lost Confidence in CGI’s Ability to Successfully Refinance? 
 
In a press release on November 30th, CGI provided investors with an update on its refinancing efforts.  As detailed below, this latest 
refinancing update struck a much more cautious tone in comparison to the company’s previous update on October 16th.  In our view, this 
significant change in tone is an indication that, after putting in months of effort with little progress, management has lost confidence in 
CGI’s ability to successfully complete the refinancing. 
 


• The refinancing update on October 16th struck a very confident tone: In CGI’s October 16th press release, CEO Paul Svindland 
expressed a great deal of confidence when commenting on the company’s ongoing refinancing efforts.  More specifically, Mr. 
Svindland thanked current lenders for their “strong support.” He also noted that the terms CGI had received from prospective 
lenders were “consistent with our range of expectations.”  Finally, he noted that management continued to “expect to 
refinance our existing facility.” 
 
Provided below are Mr. Svindland’s comments in their entirety from the October 16th press release: 
 


We were pleased to receive multiple indications of interest from both asset-based revolving lenders and term lenders to 
provide the required financing.  In particular, two members of our current bank group proposed asset-based revolving 
credit or similar facilities consistent with our requested terms.  This strong support from our current lenders is much 
appreciated and will be instrumental to our refinancing process.  In addition, we received indications from multiple term 
lenders to accompany the revolving facility, with terms being consistent with our range of expectations.  Based on 
these indications of interest, which are non-binding, we continue to expect to refinance our existing facility with a 
more appropriate long term capital structure. 


 
• The refinancing update on November 30th was notably more cautious: Fast forwarding over one month later, in CGI’s 


November 30th press release, Mr. Svindland was much more cautious when commenting on the company’s ongoing refinancing 
efforts.  For example, he thanked current lenders for their “continued support” rather than their “strong support.”  He also 
stated that CGI was continuing to “work towards accomplishing the refinancing,“ which was much more subdued compared to 
his prior statement that CGI continued to “expect to refinance our existing facility.” Finally, he made no mention of the terms 
CGI had received from prospective lenders, while in his prior comments he noted that terms were “consistent with our range of 
expectations.” 
 
Provided below are Mr. Svindland’s comments in their entirety from the November 30th press release: 
 


We were pleased to receive proposals for both an asset based revolving credit facility and term loan financing.  In 
particular, we have entered into a nonbinding letter of intent which contemplates an asset based revolving credit facility

with two of our existing revolving lenders.  This continued support from our current lenders is much appreciated as we 
continue to work towards accomplishing the refinancing. 


 
• This significant change in tone indicates that management has lost confidence:  Some investors do not pay attention to 


changes in language in public disclosures.  We believe this is a mistake.  For legal reasons, companies and their management 
teams are typically very careful that the information presented in official filings and press releases cannot be construed as 
being misleading.  Therefore, changes in how disclosures are worded can often provide important clues for investors. 
 
If CGI management was still optimistic about its chances of successfully refinancing, we believe it would have used similarly 
confident language in its latest refinancing update as it did in its prior one.  Therefore, in our view, the cautious tone that 
management has adopted indicates that it has lost confidence in CGI’s ability to refinance on acceptable terms for 
shareholders.   
 


CGI’s Financial Condition Remains Dire 
 
So why is CGI struggling so much to raise money for its new credit facility?  Well, to begin with, CGI is missing audited financials for almost 
two fiscal years and is currently under a formal investigation by the SEC.  Lenders are generally more risk averse than equity investors, 
and we believe this cloud of uncertainty surrounding CGI has likely scared off many of them. 
 
In addition to the ongoing financial restatements and SEC investigation, we believe that CGI’s dire financial condition has compounded its 
difficulties in attracting interest from lenders.  As detailed below, recent evidence indicates that CGI’s already poor operating 
performance has further deteriorated in the 3+ quarters since it last reported earnings.  As also detailed below, recent evidence in our 
view confirms that CGI’s reported TBV is significantly overstated and is likely worthless.  Therefore, we believe it is doubtful that CGI 
generates enough profit or has enough collateral to support its proposed credit facility.    
 
Despite the Recent Trucking Turnaround, CGI’s Operating Performance Appears to Have Further Deteriorated 
 
Despite recent increases in shipping volumes and rates across the trucking sector, CGI’s recent disclosures indicate that its operating 
performance continues to remain challenged.  Even worse, our research indicates that CGI’s operating performance has actually 
deteriorated significantly over the past few quarters, and will likely continue to deteriorate over the coming quarters.  We arrived at these 
conclusions based on the following: 
 


• CGI has reported estimated net losses since Q2’17: Despite a more favorable trucking environment, CGI has yet to return to 
profitability. Although the company has not reported quarterly financial results since Q2’17, CGI has communicated to investors 
that it expects to report a net loss of $10.0m in Q3’17, as well as a net losses for FY’17 and Q1’18.  Provided below is an excerpt 
from CGI’s most recent NT 10-Q filing: 
 


The Company presently expects to report a net loss for the fiscal quarter ended September 30, 2017. Because of the 
Company’s continued evaluation of the matters noted in Part III above, it is not in a position to give more detailed 
estimated results for the period.  (NT Q1’18 10-Q, 9/14/17) 


 
• Revised covenants suggest that CGI’s operating performance has deteriorated significantly since Q2’17: Although CGI has not 


filed financials since Q2’17, clues to the company’s operating performance can be found in the sixth and most recent 
amendment to the credit agreement.  Under this amendment, CGI is required to maintain a minimum LTM EBITDAR of $76.4m, 
$71.0m and $67.0m for the periods ended 9/30/17, 10/30/17 and 11/30/17, respectively: 
 



http://otp.investis.com/clients/us/celadon/usn/usnews-story.aspx?cid=671&newsid=45020

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/865941/000100888617000133/exhibit101.htm
6 


Maintain Adjusted EBITDAR, on a trailing twelve month basis, not less than (i) $76,400,000 for the twelve-month period 
ending September 30, 2017, (ii) $71,000,000 for the twelve-month period ending October 31, 2017 and (ii) $67,000,000 
for the twelve-month period ending November 30, 2017. (Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement, Pg. 5, 9/29/17) 


 
In our experience, lenders typically give a cushion ranging between 20% - 25% on this type of covenant.  After adding a 25% 
cushion to the minimum LTM EBITDAR thresholds, we estimate CGI’s LTM EBITDAR was $101.9m, $94.7m and $89.3m for the 
periods ended 9/30/17, 10/30/17 and 11/30/17, respectively.  These estimates represent a significant decline from the $127.4m 
of LTM EBITDAR that CGI last reported in Q2’17 (quarter ended 6/30/17). 
 
Based on the above analysis, we believe it is likely that CGI’s financial performance has deteriorated significantly over the past 
3+ quarters.  While it is possible that our EBITDAR estimates are too low, we do not believe this is likely.  A cushion far in excess 
of 25% for this type of covenant is something we cannot recall seeing before. 
 


• CGI’s operating performance is likely to deteriorate even further: We believe that a return to profitability for CGI is unlikely to 
happen anytime soon.  In fact, we believe that CGI’s operating performance is likely to get worse before it gets better.  Consider 
that, over the past few months, the company has been selling off divisions to fund its significant cash burn.  In September, CGI 
sold its flatbed division to PS Logistics for an undisclosed amount.  Additionally, based on a call with CFO Thom Albrecht on 
December 5th, CGI also recently sold its Quality division, a transaction which was puzzlingly not disclosed to investors in a formal 
press release. 
 


Mr. Albrecht: That leasing company is gone. 
 
Research Consultant: To clarify, Quality is the leasing business, right?  Is that still a part of Celadon? 
 
Mr. Albrecht: Yeah, that’s gone.  The employees are gone. 


 
Selling off divisions have helped CGI to stay afloat in the short term.  However, on the flipside, these dispositions will greatly 
pressure the company’s revenue and profitability going forward.  For example, as disclosed on pg. 9 of CGI’s Q2’17 10-Q, the 
Quality division generated $16.2m of revenue in Q2’17.  More importantly, this division generated $3.2m of operating income in 
Q2’17 which amounts to $12.8m on an annualized basis.  CGI will be hard-pressed to replace the loss of such a large amount of 
operating income.  (Note: Quality is also referred to as “Equipment leasing and services” in CGI’s 10-Q and 10-K filings)

Further pressuring CGI’s profitability will be its aging tractor fleet.  As per the company’s FY’16 10-K, the average age of the 
company’s tractor fleet was 1.9 years as of 6/30/16: 
 


The average age of our owned and leased tractors and trailers was approximately 1.9 years and 3.7 years, 
respectively, at June 30, 2016.  (FY’16 10-K, Pg. 7, 9/13/16) 


 
Given CGI’s challenged liquidity position, we believe it is unlikely that the company has been able to refresh much, if any, of its 
existing tractor fleet.  Thus, at the end of this year (12/31/17), we estimate that the average age of CGI's tractor fleet will be 
~3.4 yrs (1.9 yrs + 1.5 yrs). 
 
Now, consider that in CGI's FY'16 10-K, the company stated that maintenance costs begin to increase substantially once tractors 
reach 4 years of age.  Given this fact, it appears that CGI’s maintenance expenses will begin to increase significantly in 2018. 
 


Our replacement cycle for our tractors is approximately three to four years. This equipment renewal policy has allowed 
us to recognize significant benefits associated with reduced maintenance and tire expenses, as such expenses increase 
significantly for tractors beyond the fourth year of operation, as wear and tear increases and some warranties expire.  
(FY’16 10-K, Pg. 5, 9/13/16) 





Recent Evidence Strongly Supports Our Conclusion that CGI’s TBV is Close to Worthless  
 
We believe that CGI’s last reported TBV of $10.80 per share as of Q2’17 is mostly fiction.  In our Initiation Report, we concluded that CGI 
had used improper and manipulative accounting practices to significantly inflate the value of its assets, including the value of its 
equipment and JV stake.  In total, we estimated CGI’s accounting shenanigans had inflated its Q2’17 TBV by $219m, and that CGI’s actual 
Q2’17 TBV was no more than $.42 per share. 
 
Recent evidence which has emerged over the past nine months has validated much of our analysis:

• Element has written down the value of its JV stake by almost 50% over the span of just 3 quarters: In our Initiation Report, 
we estimated that CGI had overstated the value of its JV stake by $100m.  CGI marked its JV stake at $100m on its Q2’17 
balance sheet.  However, our analysis indicated that this stake was actually worthless. 
 
As disclosed on pg. 12 of its 9/30/17 earnings report, Element has written down its JV stake by 49.2% from CAD $135.8m to 
CAD $69.0m over the past 3 quarters.  In our view, this confirms that the JV value of $100m as reported on CGIs balance sheet 
is inflated and must also be written down.  We reiterate our belief that the JV is worthless. 








• BKD is re-assessing the accounting involving an extensive amount of equipment currently and previously owned by CGI: In 
our Initiation Report, we estimated that CGI had overstated the value of the equipment (PP&E + equipment held for sale) on its 
Q2’17 balance sheet by $78.8m through improper accounting methods.  Additionally, we estimated that CGI had failed to 
record a $36m loss from the sale of Quality equipment in its Q2’17 financial statements. 
 
As we highlighted earlier, on April 25th, BKD withdrew its audit opinions for CGI’s FY’16, Q1’17 and Q2’17 financial reports.  In a 
press release on May 1st, CGI disclosed that BKD was reassessing the carrying values and accounting of transactions involving 
the company’s equipment: 
 


The insufficient appropriate audit evidence relates to the carrying values and accounting (and related structure, 
substance, and disclosure) of transactions involving dispositions and acquisitions of revenue equipment between June 
and December of 2016.  Additional information concerning the transactions and the fair values of the revenue 
equipment disposed of and acquired is required to determine the appropriateness of the accounting for these 
transactions.  (CGI Press Release, 5/1/17) 


 
From the same conversation with Mr. Albrecht referenced earlier in this report, it was revealed that BKD is in the process of 
analyzing the accounting for around 11,000 “pieces of equipment” that the company currently owns or had previously owned.  
The fact that BKD is reassessing the accounting for such an extensive amount of equipment strongly indicates that the 
accounting red flags we identified involving CGI’s equipment have merit. 
 


Mr. Albrecht: There were a lot of transactions with Quality, and again that portfolio at one point had gotten up to 
11,000 pieces of equipment.  So, there’s a lot of transactions in there that are being studied (by BKD). 


 
• Bank of America explored providing an asset-backed loan (“ABL”) to CGI but walked upon further diligence, indicating that 


collateral was insufficient: As already discussed earlier, back in May, CGI signed a term sheet with Bank of America for a

proposed $225m ABL facility.  As highlighted below, availability under the proposed ABL was to be based on the value of certain 
assets which included its AR, equipment, inventory, and real estate.  In our view, Bank of America’s apparent decision to walk 
after further diligence indicates that the company did not have the necessary assets / collateral needed to close the facility – 
Further evidence that CGI’s last reported TBV is mostly fiction. 
 


The Company has reached an agreement in principle with Bank of America…for a new $225 million senior secured 
revolving credit facility ("Proposed ABL Facility").  The Proposed ABL Facility will be used to refinance the Company's 
existing credit facility…Availability under the facility will be based on a borrowing base including accounts receivable, 
equipment, inventory, and real estate at customary advance rates. The expected closing date is on or about June 30, 
2017, subject to customary closing conditions including negotiation and execution of definitive agreements, due 
diligence, and requisite approvals.  (CGI Press Release, 5/1/17) 


 
Recent evidence also indicates that CGI’s TBV has further deteriorated over the 3+ quarters since Q2’17.  As already mentioned above, 
after correcting for CGI’s improper accounting, we estimate that the company’s actual Q2’17 TBV was just $.42 per share.  We believe 
that CGI’s current TBV is less than $.42 per share and may even be negative based on the following: 
 


• Recent asset sales were likely completed at firesale prices: CGI has been selling off various assets in order to fund its ongoing 
cash burn and keep itself afloat.  Assets which have recently been sold off include its flatbed division, its driver academy and 
Quality Companies.  As disclosed in its October 2nd press release, CGI also plans on selling two more small divisions (excludes 
Quality which has already been sold), as well as excess trailers and real estate over the coming quarters: 
 


In terms of non-core assets, we exited the flatbed business and our driver-training academy in September, and we plan 
to exit three additional small businesses, including our Quality Companies lease servicing business, in coming quarters.  
In addition, excess trailers and real estate have been identified for sale.  (CGI Press Release, 10/2/17) 


 
Given CGI’s weak negotiating position, we believe that the company will likely incur significant write-downs from its asset sales.  
Supporting our conclusion is the fact that CGI 1) did not disclose the amount of proceeds it received from the sale of its flatbed 
division and driver academy, and 2) did not bother to inform investors that its Quality division had been sold.  If the sale of 
these divisions had fetched substantive proceeds, we believe CGI would have been eager to inform investors just how much it 
had received.  This lack of transparency by CGI indicates to us that these divisions were likely sold at firesale prices. 
 


• Persistent softness in used tractor prices will likely lead additional equipment write-downs: Given that 1) the book value of 
CGI’s tractors appears to be significantly inflated relative to market value and 2) used tractor prices are not expected to recover 
for quite some time, we believe CGI will need to write-down the value of its equipment to reflect current market prices.   
 
While the trucking environment has improved over the past few months, used tractor prices remain deeply depressed and 
actually declined during the first 9 months of 2017: 
 


In the larger overall wholesale environment…Average pricing in the first 9 months of 2017 is running 2.4% lower than 
the same period of 2016.  (Source: JD Power Report, Pg. 3, November 2017) 


 
According to an analyst from Stifel, used tractor prices are likely to remain soft for a while as a surplus of used tractors are 
continuously flushed into the market: 
 


There is little hope for much improvement in used truck prices over the short- to medium term…a surplus of 3-, 4-, and 
5-year-old tractors continues to be flushed [into] a used truck market that continues to be plagued by mediocre 
demand… (Transport Topics Article, 8/28/17)

CGI depreciates its tractors to a salvage value of 40% over 4 years.  This means that CGI would depreciate a tractor that is 
purchased for $135K to a salvage value of $54K after 4 years.  By comparison, the average price of a 4 year-old sleeper at 
wholesale was more than $21K or 39% lower at just $32.9K in September 2017:  
 


Average pricing by age was as follows…4-year-old trucks: $32,914 (Source: JD Power Report, Pg. 3, November 2017) 
 


• Continued operating losses:  CGI has disclosed that it expects to report a net loss for Q3’17, FY’17 and Q1’18, and we expect it 
will report continued losses for the foreseeable future.  These continued operating losses will result in further reductions to 
CGI’s TBV. 
  


Given the totality of the evidence presented above, we believe that BKD will force CGI to drastically write-down the value of its assets 
once the ongoing audit is complete.  Following these write-downs, we expect that CGI’s restated TBV will either be worthless or close to 
it. 
 


All Roads Appear to Lead to a Disastrous Outcome for Shareholders 
 
At the moment, the signs overwhelmingly indicate that CGI will be unable to secure the necessary lenders for its new credit facility.  Thus, 
we believe that CGI’s refinancing efforts will ultimately fail, and that the company will subsequently file for bankruptcy. 
 
However, even if CGI is somehow able to refinance, the outcome is still likely to be disastrous for shareholders.  As shown in the table 
below, at the end of Q2’17, CGI’s last reported debt balance including capital and operating leases was $455.3m.  Given our assessment 
that CGI has continued to burn cash since Q2’17, we believe that the company’s current debt balance has not declined and has likely 
increased. 





CGI’s current debt burden is much too high, and refinancing its existing credit facility does not address this problem.  So, what is an 
appropriate amount of leverage for the company?  In FY’13 and FY’14, CGI maintained a leverage ratio of around 3x LTM EBITDAR.  
However, as CFO Tom Albrecht acknowledged during the same conversation we referenced earlier, the company will need to begin 
refreshing its tractor fleet a year or so from now in order to keep its maintenance costs under control.  Based on this, we estimate that 
CGI will need to reduce its leverage to 2.0x LTM EBITDAR in order to give itself the necessary dry powder to finance its future tractor 
purchases. 
 


Research Consultant: Turning to your fleet…I know that maintenance costs increase quite a bit after about 3 (or 4) years…Do 
you have a plan to refresh your fleet? 


Mr. Albrecht: We do…It won’t be for probably another year. 
 



http://img03.en25.com/Web/NADAUCG/%7Bb0ba2620-6a80-4d1f-bc27-1fdf4874d2de%7D_11.2017_Commercial_Truck_Guidelines.pdf

To estimate CGI’s current LTM EBITDAR, we can once again refer to the minimum LTM EBITDAR covenant in the latest amendment to the 
credit agreement: 
 


Maintain Adjusted EBITDAR, on a trailing twelve month basis, not less than (i) $76,400,000 for the twelve-month period ending 
September 30, 2017…  (Sixth Amendment to Credit Agreement, Pg. 5, 9/29/17) 


 
CGI’s minimum LTM EBITDAR covenant for the period ending 9/30/2017 is $76.4m.  Assuming a 25% covenant cushion, we estimate that 
CGI’s LTM EBITDAR as of 9/30/2017 was $101.9m.  2.0x our estimated LTM EBITDAR of $101.9m equates to a target debt balance of 
$203.7m.  Assuming a current debt balance of $455.3m, we estimate that the company will have to reduce its debt by $251.6m to 
achieve a target leverage of 2.0x: 





For the time being, issuing additional equity does not appear to be a viable option for CGI due to its lack of audited financials.  With 
access to the equity markets cutoff, we believe that the company will need to exchange some of its existing debt (most likely its capital 
leases and operating leases) for equity in order to reduce its debt balance. 
 
As of December 20th, CGI’s share price is $6.35.  However, given that CGI’s reported TBV appears to be worthless or close to it, we believe 
that lenders will pay no more than $1.00 per share for any equity received in a swap.  This will result in an enormous amount of dilution 
for current shareholders. 
 
For example, if CGI’s equity is priced at $1.00 per share in a debt-for-equity swap, the company would have to issue 251.6m shares in 
order reduce its leverage to 2.0x LTM EBITDAR.  As shown in the table below, this would reduce the ownership of existing shareholders by 
89.9%, resulting in a near wipe-out of existing shareholder value.
