Need proof of a speculative bubble?


Closely watched hedge fund manager Jim Chanos says he has the best
barometer for gauging where 1 percenters are putting their money,
given the Federal Reserve's easy money policies that have been fueling
their portfolios to record highs. During an interview Thursday on
CNBC's "Squawk Box," he pointed to the stock chart of Sotheby's.


"That's what people are buying," Chanos said.


The chart shows that shares of Sotheby's have peaked before every
major financial bubble since 1987, starting with the leveraged-buyout
spree that fueled the stock market before the Black Monday crash that
year.

The stock "double peaked" in the past few years, since rising
exponentially following the 2008 financial crisis. Chanos attributed
Sotheby's run-up to the Fed's super-low interest rates and aggressive
asset purchases, attempts to kick-start a sluggish economic recovery
reeling from the subprime mortgage bubble.


The contemporary art market has gone "bonkers" under the Fed's easy
money policies, Chanos said. Many credit those policies for creating a
"wealth effect" that has increased the prices of all asset classes, stocks
and art included.

It's as if the Fed now includes asset prices as part of its mandate,
Chanos said. Record selling prices at auction houses don't trickle down
to the 99 percent, however, Chanos said.


"This is still driven by art, which is socially acceptable conspicuous
consumption," Chanos said. "It's one of the ultimate barometers of the 1
percent, or the one-tenth of 1 percent."

Chanos, founder of Kynikos, the largest short-selling hedge fund, said
he had a short position against Sotheby's and he advised art investors
to tread carefully.


"I own a couple pieces," Chanos said. "Anybody who buys art should be
looking to hedge it right now."
