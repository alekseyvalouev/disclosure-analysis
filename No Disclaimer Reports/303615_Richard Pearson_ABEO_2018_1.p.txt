Summary. In Oct 2017, shares of ABEO hit a new high of $19.55 following the release of seemingly 
positive data in its clinical trial for MPS-III. 


ABEO quickly used that strength to raise money in an equity offering at $16 in October. 


But when additional data was released last week, ABEO quickly began to plunge every day. 


“Smart money” investors now realized that Cohort 1 data had been badly manipulated to show optimal 
results. 


Out of a three person Cohort, one patient was given an arbitrary “floor score” for a cognitive test –
precluding any real chance of further declines in cognitive ability. Another patient was removed from 
the trial altogether. 


This information was not made clear in October at the time of the equity offering.


In addition, Cohort 2 data was visibly mixed, with the strongest results coming from a disputed test 
method and with very negative indications coming from the industry standard test. 


The leading industry journal specifically recommends two different tests than the one being used by 
ABEO. The non recommended test is the one which analysts continue to cite as indication of strong 
results. 


The investors who have figured this out have been selling heavily every day since that data was 
released on Feb 8th. 


Yet sell side analysts continue to put positive spin on the results by focusing on a single “outlier” to 
explain negative results.

ABEO Share Price Plunges Despite Strong Analyst Support 


On February 7th, Abeona’s share price reached a 2018 YTD high of $18.90. But following the release of it MPS-III 
data on February 8th, stock began to immediately plunge. Sell side analysts immediately came out in support of 
Abeona, saying that the data released did not justify the sell off. It should be noted that all of the bullish analysts 
had just acted as underwriters on Abeona’s recent equity offering and collectively shared in $5 million in fees. 


The key argument raised by these analysts was that any perceived weakness in the results was only due to a 
single outlier within a small sample set. Overall data, they say, remains positive. There may even be a possibility 
that data will show an uptrend as Cohort 2 matures. 


But as we can see from the chart below, despite the very vocal enthusiasm from sell side analysts, Abeona’s 
share price has traded straight down on heavy volume every day since that data came out. The share price has 
now fallen by 30% even as these analysts continue telling us it should double. 


“Smart money” investors have now discovered that data from ABEO’s Cohort 1 has been manipulated to 
deliver the best possible result for one of the three patients.  Then a third patient (out of three) was 
removed entirely.  This “data” is therefore entirely nonsensical. This manipulation was not made clear to 
investors ahead of the equity offering in October.  Once investors discovered this, the stock began 
plunging.

A pattern among plunging biotech stocks 


Below you can see a table of past biotech stocks that I wrote about at MoxReports.com. 


At their peaks, each of these stocks had investors salivating about their further prospects for triple (and even 
quadruple) digit gains. 


A consistent theme among biotech stocks is that complicated information can be manipulated.


To read my full article on each of the biotech stocks below, click on the name in the far left column. 


In nearly every case below, bullish sell side analysts were calling for these stocks to double or triple, just 
before they plunged to a fraction of their original price. 


As with ABEO, I highlighted significant problems with each of the biotech stocks shown in the table 
below. Yet many investors insisted on riding these down to near zero on the belief that “the market for 
such a drug would be huge”, “the affliction itself is horrible”, or simply that “much of the data looks 
good”.

Abeona: Company Overview 


Abeona Therapeutics (ABEO) is a clinical stage biotech company focused on gene therapy for rare disorders. It 
was founded around 2012 by current CEO Tim Miller and former Chairman Al Hawkins.  In May of 2015 
PlasmaTech acquired Abeona for about $34mil in stock and performance milestones.  This transaction was 
effectively a reverse merger that brought Abeona public. The company is based in Dallas, TX.


The primary focus of Abeona is ABO-102 and ABO-101, both of which are being evaluated for treatment of 
Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) type III (also known as Sanfilippo syndrome).  Nationwide Children’s Hospital 
(NCH) employees Haiyan Fu, PhD and Doug McCarty, PhD developed ABO-102 and ABO-101 and Abeona 
licensed the IP from NCH.  NCH is conducting clinical trials for ABO-102 and ABO-101and they also conducted 
the Natural History Study (NHS) being used as the control cohort in the trials.  Both ABO-102 and ABO-101 are 
currently in Phase 1/2 clinical trials for MPS IIIA and MPS IIIB.   


Abeona is also developing EB-101 for recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (“RDEB”) (also known as 
“butterfly syndrome”) which causes large open wounds and blisters.  EB-101 has completed Phase 2 trials and is 
currently in hopes of going in to Phase 3 going forward.  While EB-101 is somewhat further along the regulatory 
pathway than Abeona’s other drugs (ABO-102 & 101), analysts have only recently considered its potential and 
most have not modeled for it. This is likely due to the small addressable market, questionable efficacy, and 
competitive market for skin grafts.


Additional early stage pre-clinical programs include EB-201 for epidermolysis bullosa (EB), ABO-201 (AAV-CLN3) 
for juvenile Batten disease (JNCL), ABO-202 (AAV-CLN1) for infantile Batten disease (INCL), ABO-301 (AAV-
FANCC) for Fanconi anemia (FA) disorder and ABO-302 using CRISP/Cas9-based gene editing for rare blood 
diseases. 


Following the presentation of MPS-III data in October of 2017, shares of Abeona reached $19.95 (more than 
quadruple their 2017 lows).   Shortly thereafter, on October 19th, Abeona issued $92 million of stock in a new 
equity sale at $16.00.  


During 2017 shares of ABEO rose by as much as 4x as a result of “good data”. However, Abeona did not 
reveal the manipulation of patient data in collection of other scores. When problems began to emerge in 
Feb 2018, ABEO share price immediately tumbled. ABEO is still up by 200% vs. 2017 lows.

Recent developments – 2018 


January 29th – Abeona received Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy designation for EB-101.  This is an 
expedited program similar to Breakthrough Therapy designation, which this drug already has. 


February 7th - Abeona reported initial 30-day safety and biopotency data for the first patient enrolled in Phase I/2 
for ABO-101 in MPS IIIB.  The estimated enrollment in the program is nine patients in two cohorts.


February 7th – Matthew Herper of Forbes released an interview with gene therapy pioneer Jim Wilson.  Wilson 
has recently become concerned with toxicity in monkeys and piglets treated with high doses of adeno-associated 
virus (AAV).  AAV is the same method that Abeona utilizes to deliver ABO-102 & ABO-101 into patient tissues.  
Although some public concern has resulted from his finding ultimate consequences are currently unclear.


February 8th – Abeona reported top-line data from Phase 1/2 trial in MPS IIIA at the WORLDSymposium.  The 
data was presented by lead investigator Kevin Flanigan, MD of Nationwide Children’s Hospital.  Following the 
release of this data, ABEO’s share price quickly fell by 30% over the subsequent several days, despite positive 
commentary from analysts.


February 12th – Abeona received Orphan drug designation for ABO-202 for infantile Batten disease, a fatal 
lysosomal storage disease of the nervous system.  ABO-202 is currently preclinical and human trials have not yet 
begun.

Evaluation criteria for treating MPS-III


MPS III (Sanfilippo syndrome) is a genetic disease which causes enzyme deficiencies that result in the abnormal 
accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (sugars) in body tissues. The incidence of MPS III (four types A-D combined) 
is estimated to be 1 in 70,000 births.


In MPS III, the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the central nervous system (CNS), 
including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and eventual death. To date, 
there is no cure for MPS III and treatments are largely supportive.


In attempting to evaluate effectiveness against MPS-III, Abeona’s clinical trial is measuring two categories of 
responses. 


Biological responses measure things like the hoped-for reduction of Heparin Sulfate or GAG levels which 
remains in the cerebrospinal fluid (“CSF”) or in the urine. These are the sugars whose accumulation results in the 
damage shown above. In addition, the trial will look for increased enzyme levels as well as reduced liver and 
spleen volumes.


The biological responses can be seen as a useful indicator. In addition, they are able to be measured precisely.  
However the far more important metrics are the external/observable tests that indicate a cessation or 
slowing decline of mental and behavioral impairment.


To assess changes in adaptive functioning (behavior), Abeona uses the Vineland Adaptive Behavior 
Scale.  To assess cognitive ability Abeona uses the Leiter Scale. 


Cohort 1: Leiter Scale data so deeply manipulated as to be entirely useless. The supposedly “positive” 
data then touted as indicating success.  Cohort 2: Leiter data again has been positioned as very positive, 
even though it entirely contradicts the results of Vineland Scale.  Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases
recommended against Leiter. MPS-III competitors  (Lysogene and Shire) use “more robust” tests by 
industry.

·   info@moxreports.com ·   moxreports.com7


The Leiter Scale: Why It Was Chosen. Why It’s a Problem


To evaluate results against a control arm, Abeona is comparing behavioral and neurocognitive progression against a Natural 
History Study (“NHS”) which tracked the deterioration of MPS-III patients. That study was conducted by Nationwide Children’s 
Hospital (NCH).  Kevin M. Flanigan, MD of NCH is listed as an author of a paper that reviewed results of the NHS.  He is also 
the lead investigator that recently presented the updated results at the WORLDSymposium on February 8th.  This implies that 
the lead investigator of ABO-102 had significant control over patient selection for the Natural History Study and the clinical trial 
that it is compared against.  He also happens to have financial ties to companies including Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT) and 
PTC Therapeutics (PTCT).  


It's also worth noting that ABO-102 and ABO-101 are based on IP that was created by Haiyan Fu PhD and Douglas McCarty 
PhD.  Both are employees of Nationwide Children’s Hospital and Dr. McCarty is on Abeona’s Scientific Advisory Board.  They 
are also listed along with Dr. Flanigan as members of the NCH team that was responsible for recruiting patients for Abeona’s 
Natural History Study (slide 4).


The charts below show the deterioration suffered by MPS-III patients in the NHS.  On the left is the Leiter Scale, which 
measures cognitive ability (nonverbal IQ). NOTE the range for “normal” (i.e. unaffected) children is shown at the very top in 
shaded grey.  That range runs from around 87 on up.  You can then see the deterioration in cognitive ability for each of MPS 
IIIA and MPS IIIB sufferers.  There are two points to notice.  First, the rate of deterioration (slope) is very rapid.  Second, the 
“floor score” for the Leiter-3 scale is a score of 30.  The subjects in the study do not go lower than this.


If a patient is assigned a “floor score” of 30, it is not possible for them to show any further deterioration in their scores. A
steady state amounts to success. 


Also the data points on the Vineland scale on the right (measuring behavioral assessments) tend to be more spread out and 
declining at a slower rate. 


Below I show how in Cohort 1, the Leiter data in Abeona’s trial has been completely manipulated guaranteeing a better result,
regardless of any real world deterioration.   And in Cohort 2, it is again the Leiter data that is being widely touted as evidence 
of a strong clinical result for MPS-III patients (even though this data is directly contradicted by the Vineland data).   


Here is why all of this matters. The Orphanet Journal of Rare Diseases (OJRD)  specifically recommends two different tests 
for testing neurocognitive assessment in Sanfillippo syndrome (MPS III) patients.  The recommended tests are Bayley Scales 
of Infant and Toddler Development (3rd edition) or the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (2nd edition). The Journal 
specifically does not recommend Leiter.  Competitors Lysogene and Shire Pharmaceuticals have conducted clinical trials 
that utilized these other tests (i.e. not Leiter) for neurocognitive assessment.

Cohort 1 – Manipulated data now meaningless 


As soon as the latest data was presented, we saw the beginning of a steep and steady decline in the share price.  
Despite the chatter from the sell side analysts, I suspect that this plunge had nothing to do with any “outlier”.  
Instead, it becomes apparent that in Cohort 1, the data which was being portrayed as “strong” was actually utterly 
meaningless.  We can now see that one of the patients in Cohort 1 was assigned a “floor value” because he could 
not be accurately measured.  And then one other patient was removed entirely.  So out of a 3 person Cohort, only 
one was left with a legitimate score.  By assigning a “floor value” to that patient, it meant that there was little if any 
possibility of recording any decline in cognitive ability – in other words, the gene therapy would appear to be 
yielding a tremendous result.


As far as any presentations I can see, this arbitrary “floor score” was not made clear to investors ahead of the 
October equity offering, But it is clearly quite material.  We can now see the immediate reaction from investors, 
who have driven the stock down by 30%. Investors who bought in to that October equity offering at $16 are now 
collectively underwater by around $25 million.   


There are other problematic details worth noticing.  The Leiter data from Cohort 1 only contains a single point    (-
4), even though it is described as covering two observations. In other presentations Abeona has either shown each 
data point separately or provided a range like they did for NHS data in the very same chart.  (Notice the 
“High/Low” bar around the number -24 on the same chart). Had they broken out the two data points separately 
(like they do on every other chart) the implications of this “floor score” would have been immediate obvious to even 
a casual observer. The data is truly meaningless, but it gets worse.


Here’s why the stock is selling off: A few savvy investors now realize that cohort 1 data is effectively 
meaningless.  Had this data been previously disclosed, the stock never would have hit the highs of 2017 
and 2018.

Cohort 2 – Leiter Score Deviates Again 


Just like Cohort 1, Cohort 2 focuses on two tests, a neurocognitive test (Leiter) and a behavioral test (Vineland).  
The results of the Leiter test could be viewed to be encouraging, with some modification.  One of the three scores 
in Cohort 2 is described by sell side analysts as a visible outlier.  With the remaining two Leiter scores 
outperforming the NHS control, analysts expressed the view that the data is strong. 


But again, there is a reason why Leiter is not the industry recommended test for MPS-III.  Once we look to the right 
at the Vineland Score, we can see a very different result.  Yes, we can again see a noticeable outlier.  But we can 
also see that this outlier is now so wide that even very aggressive corrective efforts would bring it nowhere near 
the control arm.  Then we can also see that even a second patient also performed worse than the control arm.  
And the one single patient that performed better than the NHS control did so by a tiny margin of just 3 points (as 
compared to 18 points on the Leiter scale to the left.)


So in other words, the Vineland data on the right provide strong indication of little or no effectiveness being seen in 
Cohort 2.  


In Cohort 1 we saw the outright manipulation of data by arbitrarily assigning the “floor score” which would then 
result in optimal apparent performance.  But in Cohort 2, all we see is an over reliance on a test that is not 
recommended (but which shows positive results), while simultaneously ignoring the test that is industry standard 
(but shows basically zero effectiveness).     


The non recommended test provides positive results, while the industry standard test provides dismal 
results.  And then analysts tout the “encouraging results” from Cohort 2.

Who is currently selling ABEO?


As sector enthusiasm for gene therapy heated up, a number of “smart money” biotech funds began taking stakes 
in Abeona.  However, it is notable that these funds took their stakes at much lower share prices. They have also 
consistently limited their stakes to less than 5% of Abeona, so that they can retain the flexibility to immediately sell 
their shares at any time without having to disclose.  Note that Knoll Capital sits at 5.04% so is just marginally over 
that limit. 


(Note: SCO Capital owns 30% of Abeona.  SCO is the investment vehicle of Abeona’s chairman Steven H. 
Rouhandeh, who was previously an investment banker and Wall St. attorney before Abeona and its predecessor 
firm.)

What about that “outlier” ?


Clearly RBC was looking at the same data presentation that I was, but somehow their analyst came to the 
conclusion that the data was great if we could just ignore a single outlier.  RBC made no mention of the fact that 
Cohort 1 data on Leiter was now totally meaningless.  In that three person Cohort, one patient was removed, while 
the other person was given an arbitrary “floor score” from day one such that there was zero possibility of showing 
any cognitive decline, regardless of what happened in the real world.  As a result, 50% of a tiny N=2 sample size 
was now legitimate, while the other 50% was artificially “perfect”.  So again, if RBC even noticed this then they 
failed to mention it to us.


Instead, RBC focused on a single “outlier” stating that because one patient was sick on the day of measurement, 
the data was unfairly skewed.  We already saw this earlier in our analysis of Cohort 2. Yes, indeed, if we take out 
this outlier from our Leiter data in Cohort 2, then the data does look favorable.  But then when we look at Vineland 
data, results become a disaster.  Even performing a very aggressive correction for the “outlier” still shows basically 
zero effectiveness for Cohort 2 on this scale.


For their conclusion, RBC states:  
“We see the existing data from nerocog scoring systems at multiple ABO-102 doses (cohort 1 and 2) suggesting potential for 
benefit, and look to longer term follow up to resolve concerns surrounding the single patient outlier driving increased variability. 
See Exhibits 6 & 7 for details.”


But in concluding ABEO’s promising future, RBC is actually using the wrong data.  Below is a screenshot from 
RBC. You can see clearly that the data presented as “Vineland Scale” is actually the data that we saw earlier for 
the “Leiter Scale”.   This is important. The Leiter scale does indeed look quite positive (if we first exclude an 
outlier) while the Vineland scale still looks disastrous even with any correction for any “outlier”.  RBC has therefore 
assumed that the “disastrous” data is now the “positive” data. Please feel free to look back to the MPS III 
presentation from February 8th.

Conclusion – the Sell Side Says “BUY” while the Buy Side Screams “SELL” 


Immediately following the presentation of the most recent MPS-III data, sell side analysts rushed to express their 
optimism and support for Abeona. They assured the public that the data behind Abeona’s MPS-III trial was quite 
positive.  Yet any close read of the data shows us that much of the Cohort 1 data is meaningless, while the most 
recent Cohort 2 data is downright bad.  


In contrast to the optimism of the analyst / bankers, Abeona’s share price tells us a very different story.  
Immediately after the data came out, the share price began to plunge. And it has continued plunging with little 
support every day since.  


It is very easy for sell side analysts to simply regurgitate some predetermined view on a stock, even as they ignore 
facts and data which present obvious problems.


The “smart money” investors read through the data and then form their own conclusion.  


With Abeona’s share price down 30% since that data was released, it is already quite clear what the smart money 
is thinking (and doing).  


If you don’t know, it’s OK to raise you’re hand !

Some dissenting opinions on those stocks above 


Looking back to my past Biotech reports on page three, I had revealed deep problems which were so 
visible that they should largely not have been debatable. Yet many investors seek to cast blame anywhere 
they can and then insist on riding a failed investment down to zero. 


Ultimate failure. If the data were good, there would be no need to manipulate it in the first place. Yet many 
investors insist on holding their shares to zero. Common justifications include “the market potential is 
huge”, “it is such an awful disease”, “data looks great” and “I believe in company and product”.
