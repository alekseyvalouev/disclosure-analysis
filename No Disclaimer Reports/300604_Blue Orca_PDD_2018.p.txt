Pinduoduo Inc. (NASDAQ: PDD) (“PDD” or the “Company”) purports to be China’s third-leading e-


commerce platform behind Alibaba (NYSE: BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ: JD).  PDD’s meteoric rise 


has been near miraculous.  Backed by famous venture capital firms and an investment by Tencent, in three 


years PDD supposedly went from a concept on a whiteboard to a USD 19 billion market capitalization.  


Market commentators have anointed it the fastest growing e-commerce company in the world.   


Do not believe the hype.  In this report, we review and analyze multiple independent data points which 


indicate, in our opinion, that PDD inflates its reported revenues and GMV and understates its staffing costs 


and net losses.  Damningly, PDD’s own website stated that the Company’s true headcount was 4.3x times 


greater than reported in its SEC filings.  This evidence is corroborated by recruiting websites which show 


that an undisclosed related party controlled by the chairman is hiring on behalf of PDD.  In our opinion, 


this indicates that PDD likely uses this secret related party to shoulder staffing costs which should be 


included in the Company’s consolidated financials.   


We believe, based on the evidence presented in this report, that PDD’s business is worth considerably less 


than it claims.  If we value PDD on the same price-to-sales multiple as Alibaba’s but adjust to what we 


believe are actual revenues, we value PDD at $7.10 per share, a 59% downside from its last traded price.  


And this is likely conservative, as we are valuing PDD’s gimmicky fad on the same multiple as China’s 


leading e-commerce business.  Many investors may conclude, as we have, that PDD is simply uninvestable. 









































1) SAIC Filings Indicate that PDD Overstates Revenues.  In its prospectus, PDD claimed that only two VIE subsidiaries contributed 
100% of the Company’s consolidated FY 2017 revenues.  Yet in their SAIC filings, which include basic financial statements submitted 


by law to the Chinese government, these same two VIE subsidiaries reported only RMB 1.2 billion in total revenues.  After accounting 


for inter-company transactions, such SAIC filings indicate that PDD’s two VIEs generated RMB 706 million or 36% less than the 


revenues reported by PDD in its SEC filings.  We have been reviewing SAIC filings of Chinese companies for almost a decade.  Such 


filings, in our opinion, are generally indicative that a company has misrepresented its financial performance when SAIC filings differ 


materially from financials submitted to U.S. investors.   


a. SAIC Filings Also Indicate that PDD Underreports Net Losses.  Revenue recognition rules are similar under Chinese and U.S. 


GAAP and thus, in our opinion, cannot explain the discrepancy between SAIC filings and PDD’s SEC financials.  Furthermore, 


any revenue recognition discrepancies should wash out when comparing profitability across filings.  PDD reported that the net 


losses in the PRC were only RMB 417 million in 2017.  But if we add up the net losses of PDD’s two VIE entities and their parent 


company, a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, SAIC filings indicate that PDD’s net losses in the PRC were RMB 689 million in 


2017.  In our opinion, such SAIC filings show that PDD’s 2017 net losses in the PRC were 65% greater than disclosed to 


U.S. investors.

2) PDD Understates Employee Headcount and Staffing Costs.  We believe there is significant evidence to 


indicate that PDD’s business is not nearly as efficient as the Company claims and that PDD’s actual headcount 


(and by extension staffing costs) are substantially higher than disclosed in its SEC filings.   





a. PDD’s Own Website Contradicts Disclosed Headcount.  In its prospectus, PDD stated that it had a total 


of only 1,159 employees as of December 31, 2017.  However, the Wayback Machine showed that on PDD’s 


own website, PDD claimed that it had more than 5,000 employees in December 2017 and January 2018.  


Based on the disclosed headcount on PDD’s own website, we estimate that PDD’s actual staffing costs in 


2017 were RMB 716 million, RMB 489 million more than implied by PDD in its SEC financials.  In turn, 


we think this corroborates SAIC filings and supports our investment thesis that PDD incurred far higher 


losses than disclosed in its SEC filings.   





b. PDD’s Reported GMV-Per-Employee is an Inexplicable Outlier.  PDD reported RMB 167 million of 


GMV per employee in 2017.  If PDD is to be believed, it generates the highest GMV-per-employee of its e-


commerce peers and is far more efficient on an GMV-per-employee basis than even Alibaba (RMB 120 


million per employee) and JD.com (39 million per employee).  This seems unlikely.  Either PDD has hacked 


the business and operates far more efficiently than leading Chinese e-commerce peers despite their 


advantages of scale and operating experience, or PDD’s disclosed numbers are not accurate.  We believe it 


is the latter.  If instead we use the headcount disclosed on PDD’s website (instead of its SEC filings) in the 


calculation, PDD’s GMV-per-employee is RMB 53 million, right in line with the industry average for e-


commerce companies (RMB 45 million).  In our view, this is an additional data point indicating that PDD 


significantly underreports its headcount and staffing costs to U.S. investors.   





3) Undisclosed Related Party is Secretly Staffing for PDD.  In 2009, PDD’s founder and chairman, Colin (Zheng) 


Huang founded an e-commerce service company, Dongguan Leqee Network Technology Company Limited 


(“Leqee”).  PDD never even mentions Leqee in its prospectus.  Yet there is evidence for continuing transactions 


between Leqee and PDD throughout the track record period and up to October 2018.  Leqee advertised on its 


own website that it was recruiting on campus for open positions at PDD in 2017.  In addition, we found multiple 


job postings from Leqee advertising for positions at PDD, including for jobs with titles such as PDD event 


coordinator and PDD public relations manager.  We also found job postings by PDD advertising for positions at 


Leqee’s offices.  This includes advertisements for positions at PDD in Hangzhou, a city in which Leqee has 


offices but PDD never discloses any office locations.  At the very least, we think such evidence indicates 


continuing undisclosed related party transactions between PDD and Leqee.  Ultimately, we suspect that Leqee is 


secretly shouldering some of PDD’s staffing costs; costs which we believe should appear on PDD’s SEC 


financials and would increase PDD’s reported losses and undermine PDD’s reported operating efficiency.  PDD 


is not the business it pretends to be.  And its undisclosed dealings with Leqee, in our view, should subvert any 


notion that PDD is fairly and accurately representing its business and financial performance to U.S. investors.   





4) PDD Inflates Reported GMV.  E-commerce businesses, for better or worse, are valued not only on revenue and 


profitability (or lack thereof) but also on popularity metrics, principally the gross value of merchandise sold on 


the platform (GMV).  In our opinion, multiple data points suggest that PDD’s reported GMV is significantly 


inflated, presumably to make its business look more attractive to investors.   





a. PDD’s Double Contingency Architecture Promotes GMV Overstatement.  PDD defines GMV to 


include all unsold items and unsettled orders.  While this definition is standard across e-commerce 


companies, PDD’s unique architecture makes its reported GMV problematic.  PDD’s application does not 


have a “shopping cart” function.  Once a customer confirms a product selection, an “order” is automatically 


generated.  Customers have 24 hours to pay for the “order” or it is cancelled.  This is the first contingency 


(shopping cart).  The second contingency is that even if a customer enters payment information for a team 


order, the transaction will be cancelled after 24 hours if no one joins the customer’s team.  PDD’s supposed 


edge is social e-commerce, but even if the team purchase falls through and the transaction is cancelled, we 


believe that PDD still records the “order” to GMV.

.com 


In practice, we believe PDD’s reported GMV includes billions of orders that were either failed team 


purchases or were simply left in a de facto shopping cart.  We believe that PDD’s reported GMV figures 


are therefore highly misleading and are not comparable to the GMV reported by its e-commerce peers.  This 


unique architecture also explains, in our opinion, the material discrepancies between PDD’s reported GMV 


and the actual GMV implied by its disclosed payment processing fees and revenues. 





 
Source: Blue Orca Analysis of PDD’s Disclosures and Application 


*Customers can also purchase products individually, which we believe represent a small portion of total orders. 





b. Disclosed Payment Processing Costs Imply GMV 43% Less than Reported.  PDD states on its website 


that it does not charge commissions on transactions but admits that it collects a 0.6% transaction fee on 


behalf of third-party payment processors WeChat Pay and Alipay.  PDD reported that such payment 


processing costs were RMB 541 million and RMB 164 million in 2017 and Q1 2018, respectively.   If every 


transaction on PDD’s e-commerce platform generates 0.6% in transaction fee costs, then logically, such 


costs should be 0.6% of PDD’s reported GMV.  But the math does not add up.  Rather, using PDD’s 


disclosed transaction costs as an input, we calculate that PDD’s actual GMV was RMB 117 billion in 2017 


and 1Q 2018, 43% less than PDD’s reported RMB 207 billion in GMV over those five quarters.    


c. Disclosed Commission Fee Revenues Imply GMV 34% Less than Reported.  PDD also discloses 
revenues from payment processing fees, which the Company claims are 0.6% of the value of the 


merchandise sold.  This revenue should be close to the payment processing costs, but accounts for both 


returns and transactions cancelled after payment.   


Based on the disclosed commission fee revenues, the implied GMV should include all paid orders placed 


on PDD’s platform, regardless of whether the orders are delivered or returned. For the 18 months ending 


June 2018, PDD’s reported commission fee revenues of RMB 1.1 billion imply that PDD’s actual GMV 


(including returns) was only RMB 191 billion over that period, 34% less than reported to U.S. investors.  


In our opinion, this is another data point indicating that PDD simply exaggerated GMV to feed its hype 


machine.   





d. Payables to Merchants and Cash Cycle Imply GMV 47% Less than Reported.  The merchant cash 


cycle is the period of time from when a customer pays for an order to the day when the merchant receives 


the cash from the sale.  During this time PDD is holding the merchant’s cash, and thus must record a liability 


“payables to merchants.”  If PDD’s reported GMV and its disclosed balance of merchant payables are true, 


it should take an average of 10 days from the time a customer pays for an order until the time a 


merchant receives the cash.  But in practice, merchants report that the process takes much longer.  Based
4 
 


Pinduoduo Inc.│ NASDAQ: PDD                  www.blueorcacapital.com 


.com 


on our due diligence, we estimate that the actual merchant cash cycle is at least 18.5 days (from payment, 


to shipping, to receipt, through withdrawal of the cash from the merchant’s PDD account).  Because the 


actual cash cycle is much longer in practice than implied by PDD’s reported figures, we think the most 


likely explanation for this discrepancy is that PDD’s real GMV is much lower than reported.   





5) Aggressive Revenue Recognition.  PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 


transaction fees (0.6%) are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.  


Indeed, PDD reported RMB 531 million of transaction fee revenues but RMB 541 million of transaction fee costs 


in 2017, indicating that this commission fee revenue was zero margin.  We believe that prevailing GAAP 


accounting rules prohibit a company from recognizing revenues collected on behalf of third parties.   These are 


pass-through revenues which should be reported on a net, not a gross basis.  This is material because it 


demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules.  It is also material because firms like PDD trade on 


a multiple of sales.  Even if it is pass-through revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by recording a higher top 


line.   


VALUATION 


PDD claims to have gone from scratch to China’s third largest e-commerce business in three years.  The Wall St. hype 


machine, in full force, touts it as the world’s fastest growing internet company.  This hype has pushed PDD’s stock to 


nosebleed prices befitting its faddish business model.   


As a basis of comparison, PDD trades at 21.7x LTM Q2 2018 sales, twice the multiple of industry giant Alibaba (8.8x) 


and forty-four times the price-to-sales multiple of more established Chinese e-commerce businesses like JD.com 


(0.5x).  Most of JD.com’s revenues are from direct sales, not merchant services, so the comparison is not perfect.  But 


it is illustrative.  On an estimated 2018 price-to-sales ratio, PDD’s stock still looks very expensive (11.5x) compared 


to Alibaba (7.5x) and other Chinese e-commerce players.

*Ratios are calculated using the prices closed on Nov 13, 2018 


We believe, based on the evidence presented in this report, that PDD’s business is worth far less than it claims.   


Because they are chronically unprofitable, investors value growing e-commerce businesses on a multiple of sales.  We 


believe that SAIC filings provide compelling evidence that PDD’s 2017 sales were 36%-40% less than reported.  As 


a result, we believe that any valuation of PDD on a multiple of sales should adjust sales figures accordingly to reflect 


its SAIC filings.  On an adjusted sales figure, using Alibaba’s price-to-sales ratio (7.5x), we value PDD’s shares at 


$7.10, a 59% downside from its current price.

Valuation: P/S Multiple 


     
Source:  PDD Public Filings, FactSet, Bloomberg, Blue Orca Calculation 


Some analysts value PDD on 2020 earnings, based on the fantasy that PDD’s loss making business will magically 


become profitable by that time.  We think such prognostications fail to account for evidence highlighted in this report 


suggesting that PDD understates its headcount and by extension its staffing costs.  Which is in turn supported by 


evidence that Leqee, an undisclosed related party, is secretly bearing some of PDD’s staffing costs.  In our view, this 


evidence suggests PDD’s cost structure is more onerous than disclosed, reducing the likelihood that its chronically 


unprofitable business will somehow magically turn a corner by 2020.   


PDD is also sometimes valued as a multiple of GMV.  Here we believe there is ample evidence to support our 


investment thesis that the Company’s reported GMV is overinclusive and misleading, and that the actual transaction 


volumes through PDD’s e-commerce platform are substantially lower than the headline GMV.  We have three data 


points to suggest GMV is overstated: payment processing costs, commission fee revenues and the merchant cash 


cycle.  


PDD Overstated Its GMV by 34-47% 


  
Source: Blue Orca Calculation 


The three metrics imply that PDD’s actual GMV is between 34-47% less than reported.  If we take an average (41% 


less than reported), we can value PDD’s shares on a price-to-adjusted GMV basis.  In this calculation, we generously 


use the Company’s current price-to-GMV multiple (0.29x).  After a 20% corporate governance discount, which we 


believe is appropriate given the complete absence of transparency as to PDD’s GMV composition, we value PDD’s 


shares at $8.05 per share on an adjusted GMV-basis.

We think our valuation is conservative, as our price/adjusted sales calculation uses generous multiples attributed to 


industry leading e-commerce businesses.  But companies misrepresenting their financial performance, inflating 


important usage and popularity metrics, and engaging in undisclosed related party transactions do not deserve to trade 


at such generous multiples.  So although we value PDD’s shares at $7.10 on a price-to-adjusted sales, and $8.05 on a 


price-to-adjusted GMV, we expect some investors may conclude, as we have, that PDD is simply uninvestable.

BETTER WAY TO SELL TISSUE PAPER? 


PDD attributes its rise to the unique social and interactive characteristics of its e-commerce platform.  PDD’s 


application offers retail products through its app with a twist: instead of merely purchasing products for themselves, 


consumers can receive a discount if they can successfully entice friends, family and other members of their social 


network to join them in their purchase.  The value proposition is to enhance online shopping with elements of social 


interaction, bargain hunting and gaming.   


PDD’s so-called “team purchase” model is fairly clever.  It turns shoppers into marketers.  In order to get the best 


prices, buyers are encouraged to share product information on social networks and entice others to transact through 


the platform.  The users, in effect, are one of the primary drivers of user growth.     


PDD does not charge commissions on transactions, but rather derives almost all of its revenues from “online marketing 


services.”  Similar in concept to Google’s AdWords, merchants bid for keywords that match a product listing 


appearing in search results.  PDD also provides for advertising placements (banners/links/logos) through an online 


bidding system.   


But PDD’s platform also creates tradeoffs.  Its bargain-hunting, group-purchase model attracts cheap, low quality 


goods and lower ticket prices.  PDD’s growth has been driven by cheap goods, including fruits and vegetables, and its 


popularity is driven by users in lower-tier cities.  Its reported take-rate is low compared to other Chinese platforms 


like Alibaba and JD.com, and its average ticket size is only RMB 33, 18.2x lower than JD and 3.6x lower than 


Alibaba.1   


One analysis of the SKUs for sale on PDD’s platform, which scrubbed more than 500,000 pieces of data, reported that 


the most popular item for sale on PDD’s platform was actually tissue paper.   


 
Best Selling Item on PDD’s Platform 


Indeed, shortly after its IPO, PDD’s shares sank on accusations from various manufacturers that its platform was a 


haven for counterfeit products.  This prompted a probe from Chinese regulators, which is still ongoing (to our 


knowledge).  Although there are smart investors that are short PDD because its platform is reportedly inundated with 


counterfeit goods, we will not be discussing it in this report.  Consider it simply gravy.  Or a cherry on top of an 


already compelling short investment thesis.     


PDD sells cheap goods to China’s poorer people in China’s poorer cities.  And while there is some value in the 


business, the crux of our investment thesis is that this business is not nearly as lucrative, impressive, fast-growing nor 


as scalable as PDD would have investors believe.

SAIC FILINGS INDICATE THAT PDD OVERSTATED REVENUES AND UNDERSTATED NET LOSSES 


Publicly available filings from the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”) indicate, in our opinion, 


that PDD’s 2017 revenues were 36-40% less than reported to investors in its IPO prospectus.  SAIC filings also 


indicate that PDD’s 2017 net losses in China were 65% greater than reported in its SEC filings.   


PDD’s corporate structure is relatively simple.  Beneath an offshore holding company (Walnut HK) and an on-shore 


PRC wholly foreign-owned enterprise (WFOE), PDD operates its e-commerce business through only two variable 


interest entities (VIEs).

As of December 31, 2017, PDD only had two such VIEs: Hangzhou Aimi Network Technology Co., Ltd (“Hangzhou 


Aimi”) and Shanghai Xunmeng Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shanghai Xunmeng”).

According to PDD’s prospectus, these two VIEs contributed 100% of the Company’s consolidated revenues for 2017.

SAIC filings are submitted by Chinese companies to a division of the PRC government for the purposes of state 


oversight and regulation.  These filings include financials, which are required by law to be accurate. SAIC filings are 
not used to determine a company’s taxes (tax filings are submitted to the State Administration of Taxation).  This is 


critical, because investors often mistakenly believe that Chinese companies underreport revenues or profits in SAIC 


filings to cheat taxes, but this is nonsense as such filings are irrelevant to the determination of a company’s tax base.  


To say nothing of the ludicrous position that a company is worthy of investment if it submits false tax returns to cheat 


the taxman.    


Rather, in our experience, when the financial statements included in SAIC files differ significantly from consolidated 


financials filed by public companies to a stock exchange, it is generally a reliable indication that management has 


misrepresented the performance of the business.      


In this case, PDD’s SAIC profile is simple because it reportedly derived 100% of 2017 revenues from only two VIE 


entities.  According to PDD’s SEC filings, these two entities generated a combined RMB 1.95 billion in total revenues 


in 2017, of which RMB 1.7 billion were external revenues and RMB 207.6 million were inter-company revenues.   


 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005130/a2236295zf-1a.htm 


Yet in SAIC filings, Shanghai Xunmeng and Hangzhou Aimi reported revenues of only RMB 1.2 billion and RMB 


4.6 million, respectively, in 2017.  Combined, these two VIEs reported RMB 706 million or 36% less total revenue 


than should be the case if PDD’s SEC filings were accurate.

If PDD’s SEC filings were accurate, these two VIEs (Shanghai Xunmeng and Hangzhou Aimi) should have reported 


RMB 1.95 billion in total revenues in 2017.  Yet SAIC filings for these entities report only RMB 1.2 billion in 


aggregate revenues, 706 million or 36% less than should be the case.   


But even this calculation is arguably too generous to the Company.  PDD’s other subsidiary is a wholly-owned foreign 


enterprise (“WFOE”) which, by PDD’s own admission, does not have a value-added telecommunication services 


(VATS) license, meaning it cannot operate an e-commerce business and thus cannot generate revenues from external 


customers.  As such, only the Company’s two VIE entities can generate any revenue from PDD’s e-commerce 


business.

PDD’s prospectus stated that inter-company revenues were only RMB 207.6 million in 2017. Assuming that this 


disclosure is true, then presumably the SAIC filings from the VIEs include such intercompany revenues.  If we subtract 


the disclosed inter-company revenues, then the SAIC revenues for Shanghai Xunmeng and Hangzhou Aimi are 40% 


less than the consolidated revenues reported by PDD in its SEC filings.     


 
Source: PDD Prospectus, Companies SAIC Filings, Blue Orca Calculation  


Depending on how investors choose to account for intercompany transactions, in our opinion, SAIC filings credibly 


indicate that PDD’s 2017 revenues were 36-40% less than reported to US investors in PDD’s SEC filings. 


Revenue recognition rules are very similar under US and Chinese GAAP, so we do not believe the discrepancy can 


be reasonably explained by accounting differences between SEC and SAIC filings.  Rather, based on our eight years 


of experience in analyzing SAIC files, we believe that the most likely explanation is that PDD simply exaggerated its 


revenues in order to look more appealing to investors in anticipation of its IPO.   


The effect of such an aggregation would be magnified for a Company like PDD because e-commerce companies do 


not make profits, so they trade on a multiple of revenues.   


Furthermore, if different revenue recognition rules explained the discrepancy, we would expect such discrepancies to 


wash out when comparing profitability across filings.  But this is not the case.  


1) SAIC Filings Also Indicate that PDD Underreported Net Losses 


PDD reported RMB 525 million in aggregate net losses in 2017, of which RMB 417 million of net losses were 


purportedly incurred in the PRC.  


 
Source: PDD Prospectus 


PDD discloses that Hangzhou Weimi Network Technology (“Hangzhou Weimi”) is a WFOE and thus does not possess 


a value-added telecommunications services (VATS) license.  The WFOE is not permitted under Chinese law to engage 


in e-commerce and thus cannot generate any external revenues.  Although we can eliminate it for the purposes of 


measuring the Company’s consolidated revenues, the costs borne by this WFOE and losses generated by this WFOE 


should be included when comparing PDD’s reported net losses in its SEC filings against the losses reported by its 


PRC subsidiaries in their respective SAIC financials.   


The math is simple.  PDD reported in its prospectus that net losses in the PRC were only RMB 417 million in 2017.   


If we consolidate the losses of the VIE entities and their parent company, wholly foreign-owned enterprise Hangzhou 


Weimi, SAIC filings indicate that PDD’s reported net losses in the PRC were RMB 689 million in 2017, 65% greater 


than reported in PDD’s SEC filings.

PDD UNDERSTATES EMPLOYEE HEADCOUNT AND STAFFING COSTS 


PDD’s e-commerce business rose seemingly out of nowhere.  PDD supposedly went from zero to RMB 100 billion in 


GMV in three years.  By comparison, it took 10 years for JD.com and 5 years for Taobao to reach that level.  Not only 


was PDD the fastest company to reach RMB 100 billion in GMV, but it supposedly reached this mark with significant 


operating efficiency and a lean staffing model.   


Yet we believe there is significant evidence to indicate that PDD’s business is not nearly as efficient as the Company 


claims and requires far higher staff levels than the Company admits in its SEC filings.     


1) PDD’s Reported GMV-Per-Employee is an Inexplicable Outlier 


PDD reported RMB 141 billion in GMV in 2017, which means RMB 167 million of GMV-per-employee.2  


To put this into context, when compared to other e-commerce peers, PDD’s reported operating efficiency is a wild 


outlier.  Alibaba reported a GMV-per-employee of RMB 120 million in 2017.3  JD.com was much less efficient, 


reporting RMB 39 million in GMV-per-employee.   Note that for a proper apples-to-apples comparison, we excluded 


logistics staff of other e-commerce companies from our calculation because, unlike Alibaba or JD.com, PDD does not 


have its own logistics division.     


  
Source: Companies Public Filings, Blue Orca Calculation 


*The fiscal year end of Alibaba is March 31. For simplicity, we ignored the three months difference.   





The industry average for GMV-per-employee was RMB 45 million.  Yet PDD reported GMV-per-employee of RMB 


167 million, meaning that it is supposedly four times more efficient than more mature, industry leading e-commerce 


businesses.   


Either PDD has hacked the business and operates far more efficiently than leading Chinese e-commerce peers despite 


their advantages of scale and operating experience, or PDD’s disclosed numbers are not accurate.  We think the simpler 


                                                           
2 PDD reported that its headcount doubled in 2017, so we took the average of its headcount in 2016 and 2017 when calculating 


GMV-per-employee. 
3 Alibaba made four big acquisitions, Lazada, Youku Tudo, Cainiao and Intime, and expanded its cloud computing and international 


business. As they are not related to Taobao or Tmall, we did not include such employees in Alibaba’s headcount for the purposes 


of an apples-to-apples calculation.

and more likely explanation is that the Company understates its headcount (and overstates GMV) to make its business 


appear more efficient and scalable than it really is.       


2) PDD’s Own Website Contradicts Disclosed Headcount 


We found evidence to corroborate our suspicion. In its prospectus, PDD stated that it had a total of only 1,159 


employees as of December 31, 2017.   


 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918004833/a2235994zf-1.htm 


However, the Wayback Machine (which archives web pages) showed that on PDD’s own website, PDD claimed that 


it had more than 5,000 employees in December 2017.

5,000 employees.

Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20180117155751/http://www.pinduoduo.com:80/about.html 





Using the Wayback Machine, we can clearly see that by its own admission, PDD’s actual headcount was 4.3x greater 


than the headcount disclosed in its prospectus. 


Investors should note that as PDD’s IPO approached in summer 2018, the Wayback Machine indicates that PDD 


changed its website to reflect its SEC filings (~2,000 employees). This is notable.  It indicates that the Company was 


hastily covering its tracks in anticipation of scrutiny from the U.S. markets and IPO investors.  But the Wayback 


Machine preserved the incriminating evidence.   


There is additional reason to believe that PDD’s original disclosures on its website were correct.  Recall that based on 


PDD’s SEC filings, its GMV-per-employee was a massive outlier.  Yet if we adjust the calculation to include the 


headcount reported on PDD’s website (5,000 employees as of December 2017), voila! PDD’s adjusted GMV-per-


employee is RMB 53 million, right in line with the industry average of RMB 45 million GMV-per-employee.   


  
Source: Companies Public Filings; Blue Orca Adjustments 


*Assuming the number of PDD employee was 2,000 from January to August, 3,000 in September and October, 


5,000 in November and December, PDD has on average 2,667 employees in 2017.  Therefore, PDD’s adjusted 


GMV-per-employee ratio was RMB 53 million (RMB 141 billion divided by 2,667 employees)

If we use PDD’s actual headcount as reported on its website, its GMV-per-employee metric is in line with the industry 


average (and ceases to be an inexplicable outlier).   


Put simply, PDD’s own website directly contradicts the Company’s SEC disclosures and indicates that PDD 


underreported its headcount to U.S. investors.  


We believe that by underreporting headcount, the Company understated its staffing costs, costs which should have 


been reflected in its consolidated financials and would have made PDD’s business appear a lot worse than it disclosed.  


By how much? We can estimate the underreported staff costs because two data points give us an average monthly 


salary per PDD employee.   


First, a Chinese employment website aggregated salary information for over 1,600 positions and calculated that the 


average monthly salary of a PDD employee was RMB 24,740.  This website is akin to a Chinese version of Glassdoor.   


 
Source: https://www.jobui.com/company/11642837/salary/ 


*As of Oct 23, 2018 


PDD’s disclosures give us an almost identical figure.  Although PDD did not disclose its average staff cost in its 


prospectus, we can calculate this figure from the incremental change in PDD’s reported headcount and the increase in 


staff costs in its COGS and operating expenses.  First, the Company reported that its headcount increased by 628 


employees in 2017.   





 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005130/a2236295zf-1a.htm 


The Company reported an increase of RMB 626 million in its costs of online marketplace service in 2017, of which 


RMB 489 million was from payment processing fees and RMB 108 million was from bandwidth and server costs. 


This leaves RMB 28.7 million attributable to an increase in staff costs in its costs of revenues.

Using a similar calculation, we can deduce that the increase in PDD’s staff costs accounted as sales and marketing 


expenses was RMB 29.7 million in 2017.  


Sales and Marketing: Staff Costs Increased RMB 29.7 Million 


  
Source: Blue Orca Calculation 


PDD directly stated that the increases in staff costs were RMB 18 million and RMB 92 million in general and 


administrative expenses, and research and development expenses, respectively in 2017. Therefore, the total reported 


increase in staff costs in these categories, plus the amount included in COGS, was RMB 169 million in 2017.

Basic analysis of PDD’s financial statements indicates that its reported staff costs increased RMB 169 million on a 


reported increase in headcount of 628 in 2017.  Therefore, we can calculate that the average employee salary per year 


was RMB 268,631 or RMB 22,386 per month, which is close to RMB 24,740 reported by the third-party website.

UNDISCLOSED RELATED PARTY SECRETLY STAFFING FOR PDD 


PDD’s own website stated in black and white that its headcount by the end of 2017 was 5,000 employees, 4.3x times 


more than the meagre 1,159 reported in its SEC filings.  We believe it is reasonable to posit that the Company 


underreported staffing costs proportionally.   


Fitting this narrative, there is considerable evidence that an undisclosed related party affiliated with PDD’s chairman 


continues to secretly bear some of PDD’s staffing costs.   


PDD’s founder and chairman, Colin (Zheng) Huang is a serial entrepreneur.  He started an e-commerce site called 


Ouku in 2007, which sold electronics and home appliances.  In 2009, he started his second e-commerce company, 


Dongguan Leqee Network Technology Company Limited (“Leqee”), which provided e-commerce services to brands.  


Leqee is 100% owned by a PRC parent company, Lemai Information Technology (Hangzhou) Company Limited 


(“Lemai Hangzhou”).  Huang was the director of Lemai Hangzhou from November 2015 through May 2018, when 


he resigned prior to PDD’s IPO.

Chinese media reported that PDD’s primary e-commerce entity, Shanghai Xunmeng, was formed using a core group 


of employees from its chairman’s other entity, Leqee.  Yet there is evidence that the deep ties between Leqee and 


PDD continued long after PDD supposedly broke off from its related-party incubator.

2017.

If Leqee was recruiting for PDD in 2017, it should be plainly evident that there were undisclosed related party dealings 


between Leqee and PDD during the track record period.  And there is evidence that this practice continues to today, 


including job postings from as recently as October 2018.

company, which focuses on C2B flash sales. Its teams are from Leqee.

commerce events like Singles Day (Double 11) and another special online shopping day, Double 12.  The posting

It is critical to note that Leqee’s hiring on behalf of PDD occurred during the pre-IPO track record period and after 


PDD went public, periods in which PDD would be obligated to disclose related party transactions between the 


Company and its related entity.   


This fits the narrative that PDD’s underreports its headcount and staffing costs to U.S. investors.  If undisclosed related 


party Leqee is hiring on behalf of PDD, Leqee is bearing the staffing costs that should be borne and disclosed by PDD.   


There is also evidence to show that PDD advertises for positions to work at Leqee offices.  In its prospectus, PDD 


only discloses offices in Shanghai.  PDD does not disclose any office or employees in Hangzhou.4  As a basis for 


comparison, JD.com disclosed each office location (by city) and the size of each office in its prospectus.

According to Leqee’s campus recruiting post in October 2018, Leqee has three offices, located in the cities of 


Hangzhou, Guangzhou, and in the Green Business Building in Shanghai.

We found evidence that PDD is hiring employees to work at two of Leqee’s three offices, including in Hangzhou, a 


city where PDD supposedly does not even maintain an office.   


Hangzhou 


For example, a PDD job posting from January 2018 advertised an opening at PDD for a finance assistant.  This post 


lists the same address as Leqee’s Hangzhou office as the location for the position.

In another job posting from September 2018, PDD recruits for an analyst role.  Yet the address for the job is Leqee’s 


Hangzhou office building (Building 1, No. 611 Jianghong Road in the Shangfeng Industrial Park).

Remember that PDD discloses no office in Hangzhou and does not disclose any related party transactions between the

Prior to September 2017, PDD’s primary operating subsidiary, Shanghai Xunmeng, was registered at the following

In a July 2016 job posting, Leqee advertised that it was hiring for interns at Pinduoduo and Pinhaohuo (PDD’s old 


business), which Leqee referred to as its mobile e-commerce division.  This post is notable not only because Leqee 


claims to occupy the entire 11th floor of the Green Business Building, but also because it refers to PDD as a division 


of Leqee.   


Excerpt from Leqee Job Post for PDD

This recruiting advertisement was posted during the pre-IPO track record period, when PDD would have an obligation 


to disclose any related party transactions between Leqee and PDD.  Yet Leqee is never mentioned in PDD’s 


prospectus.   


Another news article from August 2016 also reported that Pinduoduo staff, who worked on the 11th floor of Green 


Business Building, said they were under a business department of Leqee.

Although Shanghai Xunmeng changed its registered address in September 2017 to PDD’s new Shanghai headquarters, 


there is evidence suggesting that PDD’s staff still operate out of Leqee’s office space in the Green Business Building.

an opening for a position located on the 11th floor of the Green Business Building.

Leqee also advertises for job openings at exact same address! Even the room numbers are the same.

We think these posts clearly demonstrate that PDD’s subsidiary is advertising for PDD employment positions located 


at Leqee’s Shanghai offices.   


To review.  PDD never discloses any related party transactions with Leqee in its public filings.  PDD never even 


mentions Leqee in its prospectus, despite common ownership and even though Chinese media reported that PDD was 


formed with a development team from Leqee.  


Yet there is evidence for continuing transactions between Leqee and PDD throughout the track record period and up 


to and including October 2018.   


Leqee advertised on its own website that it was recruiting on campus for PDD.  We also found multiple job posts on 


independent websites in which Leqee is listed as the hiring company for positions such as PDD event coordinator, 


PDD public relations manager and PDD financial analyst.

In addition, we found multiple job postings from PDD subsidiaries which advertise for open positions at PDD but list 


Leqee’s offices as the work address for the positions.  This includes advertisements for openings at PDD in Hangzhou, 


a city in which Leqee has offices but PDD never discloses any office locations.   


At the very least, we think such evidence indicates continuing undisclosed related party transactions between PDD 


and Leqee.  Furthermore, we think such recruiting advertisements show fairly unambiguously that Leqee is hiring for 


PDD and that PDD is hiring for positions to work out of Leqee’s offices.   


This evidence also corroborates evidence presented in the previous section which indicates that PDD is underreporting 


its headcount – as it indicates some PDD employees are staffed by Leqee.   


In our opinion, this evidence supports our supposition that Leqee is secretly shouldering some of PDD’s staffing costs, 


costs which we believe should appear on PDD’s SEC financials and would increase PDD’s reported losses and 


undermine PDD’s reported operating leverage and efficiency.  PDD is not the business it pretends to be.  And its 


undisclosed dealings with Leqee, in our view, should subvert any notion that PDD is fairly and accurately representing 


its business and financial performance to U.S. investors.

PDD INFLATES REPORTED GMV 


E-commerce businesses, for better or worse, are valued not only on revenue and profitability (or lack thereof) but also 


on operating metrics, principally the gross value of merchandise sold on the platform or through the application 


(GMV).   


In its prospectus, the Company reported that its GMV was RMB 141 billion and in 2017, RMB 66 billion in Q1 2018, 


and RMB 82 billion in Q2 2018.6  If we chart various disclosed GMV data points, we can see that PDD’s reported 


growth trajectory appears near miraculous. 


 
Source: Goldman Sachs Report, September 13, 2018 


So much of the bull case for PDD rests on the supposedly meteoric growth of its reported GMV.   


Yet we believe that there is significant evidence, including commission fee revenues and payment processing costs 


disclosed by PDD in its SEC filings, to suggest that PDD’s reported GMV is highly misleading and that the actual 


transaction volumes on its applications are materially lower than disclosed.     


a. Double Contingency Application Architecture Promotes GMV Overstatement 


In its prospectus, PDD defines GMV as “the total value of all orders for products and services…regardless of whether 


the products and services are actually sold, delivered or returned.”  


 
Source: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1737806/000104746918005130/a2236295zf-1a.htm 


Although the SEC questioned, in correspondence with Alibaba, the inclusion of unsettled orders and unsold items in 


reported GMV, this definition is standard across e-commerce companies.   


That said, we believe there is something unique about PDD’s e-commerce application which makes its reported GMV 


figures substantially more misleading than the GMV figures disclosed by other Chinese e-commerce giants using a 


similar GMV definition.   


On U.S. e-commerce platforms like Amazon or eBay, a customer browses for an item, places it in a cart, and then 


pays for the item upon checkout.  Setting aside the issue of returns, the GMV figures that these companies disclose 


                                                           
6 PDD disclosed that its Q1 17 GMV was RMB 66.2 million in the first version of its F-1, but removed that information from other 


versions.  PDD’s Q2 2018 GMV was disclosed in a Goldman Sachs research report dated September 13, 2018.

represent the total volume of orders paid for on an e-commerce website or app.  Chinese e-commerce applications 


such as Taobao and JD.com are slightly different, in that customers submit an order prior to making a payment.   


Take Taobao for example.  When a customer wants to purchase a product, he or she could add it to a shopping cart or 


choose to buy immediately; then confirm his or her selection of the color, quantity and/or size of a product, and finally 


submit the order.  On Taobao, customers must affirmatively click the “submit order” button for an order to be 


placed.  They are then taken to a payment screen.   


 
Source: Taobao Mobile App 


But PDD’s application is unique even by Chinese standards.  On PDD’s app, when a customer confirms his or her 


selection of the color, quantity and/or size of a product, an order is automatically generated.  The shopping cart 


function is effectively eliminated.   


 
Source: PDD Mobile App 


Once a customer completes his or her selection of a size and/or color or type of product, an order is automatically 


generated on the application.  If, at this point, you try to exit the “select a payment method page,” a message will pop
31

up on your phone saying “This order has been saved for you. You can make the payment within 24 hours. (This order 


can be viewed in Your Account).” And if you go to ‘My Orders’ page, you will see the saved order. 





 
Source: PDD Mobile App 


Because of its automatic order submission and the absence of any “shopping cart” function, we believe that the 


Company counts as GMV orders that are placed without even a basic commitment to complete the transaction.  If the 


purpose of GMV is to disclose transaction volumes and not simply aspirations, then including such aspirations as 


“orders” would seem highly misleading to investors.     


But the absence of a shopping cart function is only the first contingency.  There is a second.  If you elect a team 


purchase price for a product, but no one joins your “team” for the team purchase, the transaction is also cancelled after 


24 hours.  Even if a customer makes a payment (passing the first contingency), the failure to attract fellow purchasers 


to a team purchase order will also result in cancellation of the transaction (the second contingency). 


This is what we refer to as the double-contingency.

*Customers can also purchase products individually, which we believe represent a small portion of total orders.

The flowchart summarizes the various steps involved to complete a sale on PDD’s mobile platform.  Since PDD 


generates product orders automatically for customers prior to payment, unpaid orders on PDD’s application replace 


the shopping cart function.  In our view, this leads to a massive distortion of GMV, especially when compared to other 


Chinese e-commerce companies.  Then there is a second contingency.  Even if the customer enters payment 


information, the transaction could still fall apart if the customer could not find enough people to complete a team 


purchase within 24 hours.  


PDD will no doubt retort that its reported GMV comports with its definition of GMV in its prospectus, which states 


explicitly that GMV includes unsold items.  Although this may be technically correct, our point is larger.  Investors 


and merchants use reported GMV as a proxy for the volume of transactions and merchandise sold through an e-


commerce application.  Our point is that the Company’s reported GMV is misleading because it is so over-inclusive 


(by definition) that it is neither a reflection of the total transaction volumes on PDD’s application nor is it a proper 


basis for an apples-to-apples comparison of transactional volumes across e-commerce platforms.   


Why do we care? Because we believe that PDD discloses GMV to make its stock look more attractive to investors.  


Investors making a headline comparison between PDD’s reported GMV and other e-commerce businesses like JD.com 


or Alibaba could easily be forgiven for believing they are making an apples-to-apples comparison.  But we believe 


that this is clearly not the case.   


Indeed, there are at least three data points which we believe indicate that PDD’s true GMV is between 34-47% less 


than the figure reported.  In our view, anyone looking to value PDD on its GMV or compare transactional volumes 


and popularity across e-commerce platforms should adjust PDD’s reported GMV to reflect the actual volume of 


merchandise sold through its application.   


b. Disclosed Payment Processing Costs Imply GMV 43% Less than Reported.   


PDD tells merchants on its website that it does not charge a commission on transactions.  It does, however, state that 


it collects a 0.6% transaction fee on behalf of third-party payment processing services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.  


PDD Merchant FAQ

In PDD’s SEC filings, PDD discloses the total amount of commission fees collected on behalf of third parties as 


revenues and the transaction fees remitted to payment processors as a cost.  Setting aside for the moment the ludicrous 


accounting decision to record pass-through commission fees on a gross (and not a net) basis, PDD’s disclosures tell 


us a lot about the actual volume of transactions on its application.

Payment Processing Costs and Commission Fee Revenues 


 
Note: This diagram represents the ultimate allocation of money from a successful transaction on 


PDD’s application (as we understand it), not the actual cash flows. 


If every transaction on PDD’s e-commerce platform generates 0.6% in transaction fee costs, then such costs should 


be 0.6% of PDD’s reported GMV.  But the math does not add up.   


PDD reported that such payment processing costs were RMB 541 million and RMB 163.7 million in 2017 and Q1 18, 


respectively.  Using PDD’s disclosed transaction costs as an input, we calculate that PDD’s actual GMV was RMB 


90 billion in 2017, 36% less than PDD’s reported RMB 141 billion that year.   


 Payment Processing Costs Implied 43% GMV Overstatement 


 
Source: PDD Public Filings, Goldman Sachs Report, September 13, 2018, Blue Orca Calculation 


The difference is even greater in the first quarter of 2018.  PDD reported that payment processing costs were only 


RMB 164 million in 1Q 2018, which would imply that PDD’s actual GMV was only RMB 27 billion that quarter, 


59% less than the RMB 66 billion reported to U.S. investors.   


On an aggregate basis, PDD’s disclosed payment processing fees imply GMV is 43% less (RMB 90 billion) than 


reported over those five quarters.7  Notably, PDD stopped disclosing transaction fee costs in Q2 2018, likely because 


such figures materially undermined its reported GMV.   


Perhaps the Company would argue that payment processing costs are not reflective of total GMV because the 


Company still collects commissions on returned orders and does not remit fees on such orders to merchants.   





                                                           
7 A Credit Suisse report in September 2018 stated that Tencent will or has (it is unclear) reduce its processing fee from 0.6% to 


0.4%.  While the date of the change in fees is unclear (Credit Suisse does not give a timeframe), there is nothing to indicate that 


the fee rates changed prior to 2Q 2018, and thus would not impact the calculations set forth above.

We think this is unlikely to explain the discrepancy.  PDD does not disclose the return rate of goods on its platform, 


and some commentators expect the return rate to be high because the number of counterfeit and cheap goods sold on 


PDD’s platform.  But the low-price of the products also discourages customers from incurring the extra cost to return 


such cheap purchases.  Therefore, we believe PDD’s return rate is likely around 6%, similar to its peers like Tmall. 


Accordingly, that return rate would not be sufficient to explain the major discrepancy between reported and actual 


GMV implied by the Company’s disclosed payment processing costs.   


c. Disclosed Commission Fee Revenues Imply Actual GMV 34% Less than Reported.   


PDD also discloses revenues from payment processing fees from merchants, which the Company claimed in its 


prospectus were 0.6% of the value of the merchandise sold. 


Based on this disclosed commission fee revenue, the implied GMV should include all paid orders placed on PDD’s 


platform, regardless of whether the orders are delivered or returned. The Company reported GMV of RMB 289.9 


billion for the last 18 months ending June 2018.8  


  
Source: PDD Public Filings, Goldman Sachs report, September 13, 2018, Blue Orca Calculation 





For the six quarters ending 2Q 2018, the Company also reported its commission fee revenue was RMB 1.1 billion, 


which implied the GMV was only RMB 191 billion, 34% less than reported.    


The discrepancy, we believe, is explained by PDD’s over-inclusive definition of GMV as applied to its unique 


application architecture.  In practice, we think PDD’s reported GMV includes not only successful transactions, but 


also orders that are generated but abandoned (i.e., left in the “cart”) and failed team purchases.  While PDD will no 


doubt claim that its reported GMV comports with its disclosed definition of GMV, this misses the point.  The point of 


disclosing GMV should be to give investors a metric to measure the volume of transactions on a platform.  Here PDD, 


in our opinion, totally fails.

*PDD stated it recognizes commission fee revenue when customers receive products, but in reality, it collects 


commission fee when customers make payments regardless of receipts. 


d. Merchant Payables and Cash Cycle Imply GMV Overstated 


Other PDD disclosures likewise imply that GMV is much lower than reported.  When a merchant sells a product to a 


customer through PDD’s application, there is a multi-day procedure, including a number of steps, from the time a 


customer makes a payment to the day when the merchant actually receives cash from their PDD account after a 


successful sale.  We call this the merchant cash cycle.  


From the time the customer pays for the order until the time the merchant withdraws the cash, PDD has possession of 


the funds.  It is therefore obligated to disclose on its balance sheet a line item liability called “payables to merchants.”  


This amount represents the funds, on any given day, which are held by PDD but are to be paid to its merchants when 


their transactions are finalized. 


PDD disclosed RMB 82.5 billion in GMV in Q2 2018, just under RMB 1 billion per day.  However, the average 


payables to merchants between Q1 and Q2 2018 was only RMB 9 billion.  A simple calculation with these two figures 


shows that if the Company’s disclosures of GMV and payables are accurate, it should take an average of 10 days 


from the time a customer pays for an order until the time a merchant receives their cash.9

9 For simplicity’s sake we disregard returns, which we believe account for roughly 6% of all orders.  This is the same return rate 


of other e-commerce businesses such as Tmall.  It also makes intuitive sense that the return rate would be lower.  Despite a high 


complaint rate, the low-price of products sold on PDD’s application likely discourages customer to go through all the trouble to 


return products.

But this cash conversion cycle implied by PDD’s financials appears substantially lower than merchants report in 


practice.   


The cycle is as follows.  When a customer selects an item and initiates a team purchase, an order is then generated.  


Once a team purchase order is generated and the customer enters their payment information, others have 24 hours to 


join the ‘team purchase’ or the order is cancelled.  If other customers join, then the order is successful and the group 


pays for the products.  At this point, PDD takes possession of the funds and has a liability on its balance sheet for the 


money held on behalf of the merchant.  After the payment, the merchants then have 48 hours to ship the order. Once 


customers receive their orders, they need to confirm the receipt.  If they do not, PDD’s system automatically confirms 


for buyers after 15 days. Then, it might take up to 24 hours for the amount to be posted on a merchants’ PDD accounts. 


When merchants submit money withdrawal requests, it could take 2 to 4 days to receive the cash.   





Merchant Cash Cycle Timeline 





To better understand the timeline of this process, we contacted a consultant who specializes in advising merchants on 


PDD and who was quoted in a Bloomberg article as an expert on the practical mechanics of PDD’s process. The 


consultant owns a 30-employee company which teaches merchants how to maximize their sales on the PDD platform. 


He has coached more than 400 merchants. He told us that, on average, it takes 15 days from shipping to have the 


transaction amount posted on merchants’ accounts and another two days to process money withdrawal requests.  


In January 2018, a new PDD merchant queried on a PDD online support forum how long it takes for money to be 


available for withdrawal after a customer receives the goods.  Another merchant replied around 15 days.  


 
Source: http://mmsbbs.pinduoduo.com/forum.php?mod=viewthread&tid=21044 


Based on this data and our understanding of the procedures, we estimate that it takes a merchant an average of 18.5 


days to convert a sale to cash.  This is almost double the 10-day merchant-payables cycle implied by PDD’s SEC 


disclosures.  


We think the simplest and most likely explanation for the difference between the implied cash cycle and the actual 


experience of merchants is that the Company inflates its reported GMV.   


If the actual cash cycle is 18.5 days, then the implied GMV of completed transactions would be RMB 44.1 billion, 


47% less than PDD’s reported GMV.   





How long does it take from buyers confirming receipts to 


having transacted amount available to withdraw? 


It takes approximately one day to withdraw cash, but it takes some time for the transacted amount to be 


shown on your (PDD) account. Anyway, you should be prepared for around 15 days, half a month.  


After buyers confirm receipts, how long does it take for the transacted amount to be available for 


withdrawal? How long is the cash cycle?

Sensitivity Analysis of GMV Implied by Cash Cycle 


 
Source: PDD Public Filings, Blue Orca Calculation 


*For simplicity, we ignored the impact of returned orders 


Note the sensitivity of our calculation to changes is the payables cycle.  Our calculation of the merchant cash 


conversion cycle (18.5 days) assumes no return and that merchants would withdraw cash as soon as the money hits 


their PDD account.  In reality, we believe the cash cycle should be longer, as merchants may not withdraw money 


every day.10   


So much of the hype around PDD is based on the meteoritic growth its headline GMV.  Yet the cash cycle triangulates 


with the transaction volumes implied by PDD’s disclosed payment processing costs and revenues; which together 


suggest PDD’s actual GMV is between 34%-47% lower than the headline GMV figure reported to investors.

10 This calculation is based on our due diligence, and thus is by necessity a rough estimate of the cash cycle and the timeline for 


merchants to get paid.  PDD likely has this data, but to our knowledge, fails to disclose it to investors.

AGGRESSIVE REVENUE RECOGNITION 


We believe that prevailing GAAP accounting rules prohibit a company from recognizing revenues collected on behalf 


of third parties.  FASB Topic 606 specifies that when a third party is involved in a transaction, an entity should record 


revenue on a gross basis only if it is acting as a principal. Otherwise, the entity is an agent and should record only net 


revenue.  


As discussed above, PDD reports transaction fee revenues in its SEC filings, generally 0.6% of the value of 


merchandise sold.  But PDD explicitly tells merchants that it collects no commissions, and that the 0.6% transaction 


fees are collected on behalf of third -party payment services such as WeChat Pay and Alipay.  


 
Source: https://ims.pinduoduo.com/#!/zhaoshang/problem 


PDD tells merchants that the transaction fees are just collected on behalf of third parties.  Accordingly, we think 


revenue recognition rules should prohibit PDD from recognizing this pass-through revenue on a gross basis.11   


Indeed, PDD reports RMB 531 million of transaction fee revenues but RMB 541 million of transaction fee costs.

11 To our knowledge, PDD did not receive a discount from WeChat Pay before 2Q 2018, although this an area where PDD’s lack 


of transparency has created confusion.  PDD stated in its prospectus that Tencent (WeChat Pay) agreed to provide them with Weixin 


payment services and charge a rate no higher than the normal rate of its payment solutions charged to third parties, which is 0.6%.

We think in this case that accounting rules clearly prohibit PDD from recognizing transaction fees collected on behalf 


of third parties on a gross basis.  But that, it appears, is exactly what they do.   


This is material because it demonstrates PDD’s aggressive approach to accounting rules.  It is also material because 


firms like PDD trade on a multiple of sales.  Even if it is zero margin revenue, PDD can inflate its stock price by 


recording a higher top line.

VALUATION 


PDD claims to have gone from scratch to China’s third largest e-commerce business in three years.  The Wall St. hype 


machine, in full force, touts it as the world’s fastest growing internet company.  This hype has pushed PDD’s stock to 


nosebleed prices befitting its faddish business model.   


As a basis of comparison, PDD trades at 21.7x LTM Q2 2018 sales, twice the multiple of industry giant Alibaba (8.8x) 


and forty-four times the price-to-sales multiple of more established Chinese e-commerce businesses like JD.com 


(0.5x).  Most of JD.com’s revenues are from direct sales, not merchant services, so the comparison is not perfect.  But 


it is illustrative.  On an estimated 2018 price-to-sales ratio, PDD’s stock still looks very expensive (11.5x) compared 


to Alibaba (7.5x) and other Chinese e-commerce players.

*Ratios are calculated using the prices closed on Nov 13, 2018 


We believe, based on the evidence presented in this report, that PDD’s business is worth far less than it claims.   


Because they are chronically unprofitable, investors value growing e-commerce businesses on a multiple of sales.  We 


believe that SAIC filings provide compelling evidence that PDD’s 2017 sales were 36%-40% less than reported.  As 


a result, we believe that any valuation of PDD on a multiple of sales should adjust sales figures accordingly to reflect 


its actual revenues.  On an adjusted sales figure, using Alibaba’s price-to-sales ratio (7.5x), we value PDD’s shares at 


$7.10, a 59% downside from its current price.   


Valuation: P/S Multiple

Some analysts value PDD on 2020 earnings, based on the fantasy that PDD’s loss making business will magically 


become profitable by that time.  We think such prognostications fail to account for evidence highlighted in this report 


suggesting that PDD understates its headcount and by extension its staffing costs.  Which is in turn supported by 


evidence that Leqee, an undisclosed related party, is secretly bearing some of PDD’s staffing costs.  In our view, this

evidence suggests PDD’s cost structure is more onerous than disclosed, reducing the likelihood that its chronically 


unprofitable business will somehow magically turn a corner by 2020.   


PDD is also sometimes valued as a multiple of GMV.  Here we believe there is ample evidence to support our 


investment thesis that the Company’s reported GMV is overinclusive and misleading, and that the actual transaction 


volumes through PDD’s e-commerce platform are substantially lower than the headline GMV.  We have three data 


points to suggest GMV is overstated: payment processing costs, commission fee revenues and the merchant cash 


cycle.  


PDD Overstated Its GMV by 34-47% 


  
Source: Blue Orca Calculation 


The three metrics imply that PDD’s actual GMV is between 34-47% less than reported.  If we take an average (41% 


less than reported), we can value PDD’s shares on a price-to-adjusted GMV basis.  In this calculation, we generously 


use the Company’s current price-to-GMV multiple (0.29x).  After a 20% corporate governance discount, which we 


believe is appropriate given the complete absence of transparency as to PDD’s GMV composition, we value PDD’s 


shares at $8.05 per share on an adjusted GMV-basis.    





Valuation: P/GMV Multiple 


   
Source:  PDD Public Filings, Goldman Sachs research report on September 13, 2018, FactSet, Blue Orca Calculation 


We think our valuation is conservative, as our price/adjusted sales calculation uses generous multiples attributed to 


industry leading e-commerce businesses.  But companies misrepresenting their financial performance, inflating 


important usage and popularity metrics, and engaging in undisclosed related party transactions do not deserve to trade 


at such generous multiples.  So although we value PDD’s shares at $7.10 on a price-to-adjusted sales, and $8.05 on a 


price-to-adjusted GMV, we expect some investors may conclude, as we have, that PDD is simply uninvestable.
