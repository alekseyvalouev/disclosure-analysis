Summary
Nymox withheld the data that Phase 3 trials of its only drug had failed for 6-12
months after management knew of the failure.
During this time, Nymox issued bullish press releases while management
continued to aggressively dump stock without timely SEC disclosure.
Offshore anonymous Panamanian �nance deals; auditor, legal counsel,
bankers ALL closely tied to regulatory violations, stock promotions and/or
outright frauds.
Nymox moved its domicile from Canada to the Bahamas to limit transparency
and legal liability. No institutional ownership or research coverage by anyone.
Nymox is down to $800,000 in cash and has just $41,000 in quarterly
revenues. Bogus misleading press releases have caused the stock to recently
soar.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 2/43


Authors note: Prior to publication, the author �led a formal written whistle-blower complaint
with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), including details from the
article below.


Investment summary – catalysts for a decline to true zero.


The key points I will make in this article are as follows:


1. Nymox management has consistently and repeatedly misled
shareholders about its prospects in a material way – and then dumped stock
at in�ated prices without making timely SEC disclosures. The stock price then
crashes.


2. Following the ensuing fraud lawsuits, Canadian Nymox reincorporated in the
Bahamas to limit disclosure and legal liability. It then quickly resumed its
promotional activities from the Bahamas.


3. Nymox has a history of using anonymous offshore Panamanian �nanciers who
then fail to disclose share ownership or their unregistered offshore dumping
of stock.


4. Unremedied material weakness in internal controls, a “going concern”
warning and a highly problematic penny stock auditor of past stock
promotions. Auditor Thayer O’Neal is simply a renamed “spin off” from
previous auditor who was dissolved by the PCAOB for gross audit
de�ciencies.


5. Nymox’s legal counsel has recently been charged by the SEC with stock
fraud, engaging in pump and dumps and market manipulation. He has a long
history of such activities.


6. Nymox’s banker has a long history of involvement with penny stock
promotions and blatant SEC violations when raising money for microcaps.
Signi�cant history of their troubled clients going to zero after raising money
from investors.


7. The doctor who was quoted in the recent bullish Nymox press release failed
to disclose his direct funding from Nymox as well as ownership of shares.


8. More details on repeated small purchases by new board member James
Robinson


Nymox Pharma (NASDAQ:NYMX (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NYMX)) is a “no-brainer”
short which I expect to go to true zero. The company bears many striking similarities to
Force�eld Energy (NASDAQ:FNRG (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNRG)) which quickly
collapsed by 99% within a few days following my exposé of that company.


Multiple parties behind Nymox have been behind other stock promotions which have declined by at
least 99%.


Shares of Nymox Pharma had nearly doubled this year as a result of several grossly misleading
press releases issued by the company. The shares are now up by nearly 10x from their 2015 lows.


Nymox has been around for over 30 years but has failed to ever have a commercial success. In
November of 2014, the company announced that its only clinical drug (NX-1207) had failed both Phase
3 clinical trials it was in, sending its stock to as low as 39 cents. However, Nymox management had in
its possession the information that the trials had failed for as long as 6-12 months prior to releasing
the news to the public.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 3/43


During that time (well after the drug had failed), Nymox management continued to put out bullish
press releases while dumping millions in stock without making timely SEC disclosures of the
sales. During this time, Nymox also raised millions more for the company by placing unregistered stock
with an anonymous o�shore Panamanian shell company. The Panamanian shell has never
disclosed its ownership and has never disclosed its sales of stock.


On the legal side, Nymox is represented by Zouvas & Associates LLP. Luke Zouvas was previously a
partner with Luis Carrillo in the �rm Carrillo Huettel & Zouvas, LLP. That �rm imploded when Carrillo
was charged by the SEC in a wide range of small cap pump and dump fraud schemes
(http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2015/sep/07/ticker-lawyer-luis-carrillo-wont-�ght-
charges/) involving Canadian stock promoters and Bahamas based brokers.


(Note that Nasdaq listed Nymox was originally a Canadian company. In order to avoid legal scrutiny
and liability, Nymox recently (July 2015) re-domiciled itself to the Bahamas.)


Zouvas himself can now be tied to numerous small cap pump and dump stock promotions and was just
recently (April 2016) charged by the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2016/comp23526-
zouvas.pdf) for outright stock fraud using o�shore companies, undisclosed ownershipand sales
of stock, as well as false and misleading press releases issued by the company.


Past Zouvas stock promotions (which all imploded) bear striking similarities to Nymox.


Nymox has quarterly revenues of less than $50,000 and is down to less than $1 million in cash. The
company has had unremedied material weaknesses in internal controls for over two years and has
a going concern warning.


Nymox’s auditor, Thayer O’Neal was created as a direct spino� of LL Bradford, when that �rm was
recently shut down by the PCAOB for multiple gross audit de�ciencies. The new “spin o�” auditor
simply changed its name and picked up LL Bradford’s troubled clients, all of which (aside from Nymox)
have imploded to just pennies.


Nymox’s banker is Chardan Capital markets. Chardan and its founders have a lengthy history of run ins
with regulators, including cases of market manipulation, numerous imploded reverse merger frauds and
charges of defrauding the Small Business Administration.


Similar to Force�eld Energy , Nymox “appears” to have just 1% institutional holdings with the rest
“supposedly” being scattered among small retail holders. Nymox has zero research coverage.
Following my exposure of Force�eld, the share price plunged 60% within 3 days. The Chairman was
then quickly arrested by the FBI for manipulating the worthless stock. After being halted, Force�eld
quickly fell to zero. I believe that with Force�eld there were large holdings of stock being held by
undisclosed o�shore holders. These holders were well aware that the company was a sham and were
the �rst to dump shares at any price as soon as I exposed the promotion. There was simply no value in
the company and no bottom in the share price.


In the last section below, I will also provide more information on recent share purchases by an 81 year
old Hollywood �lm director (James Robinson) who was appointed to the board of Nymox in 2015.


Background


Over the past few years, I have exposed a wide variety of deeply troubled companies. I have
highlighted these companies as attractive targets for short selling opportunities. Following exposure,
many of these companies quickly plunged by 80% or more. Examples of my “targets” which
subsequently plunged by at least 80% include:

(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TEAR)), Tokai Pharma (NASDAQ:TKAI
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/TKAI)).


These were the absolute homerun short trades.


But in fact, I have also exposed dozens of others which also quickly fell by at least 50%. This can be
seen by looking at a list of my prior articles (http://seekingalpha.com/author/richard-
pearson/articles#view=regular_articles). While not the epic homeruns, I would also consider drops of
50% or more to be very successful short trades.


In my earlier career years, I spent nearly a decade as an investment banker for a major �rm on Wall
Street, with a primary focus on healthcare companies, biotechs in particular. I performed due diligence
on more companies than I can count and helped successful biotechs raise billions of dollars. I learned
quite a bit about what separates “real” biotechs from the “wanna be’s”.


It is now many years later, and I have parlayed that experience into investing for my own account. I
continue to focus heavily on biotechs and (as my regular readers know) I often focus on short selling
opportunities, betting on declines in the share prices of biotechs which have underlying problems.


Examples of my past biotech exposés include CytRx , Galena , Ziopharm (NASDAQ:ZIOP
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/ZIOP)), Revance Therapeutics (NASDAQ:RVNC
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RVNC)), Regulus , Keryx Biopharm (NASDAQ:KERX
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/KERX)), Ohr Pharma . Each of these stocks quickly fell by at least 60-
90% as their problems unfolded.


And now I get to tout my most recent successful short prediction.


About 2 weeks ago, Shares of Tokai Pharma plunged by 80% in a single day when its prostate cancer
drug (Galeterone) failed Phase 3 trials (http://investors.tokaipharmaceuticals.com/phoenix.zhtml?
c=252857&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2188163). This is yet another stock which I had warned investors
about (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3632506-wrong-tokai-pharmaceuticals) in late 2015. When I
wrote about Tokai, the stock had been trading at around $10. I showed that Tokai was engaged in
“after-the-fact cherry picking” of data and highlighted heavy insider selling. I described Tokai as a
“no brainer short“.


Following my article, Tokai’s share price ground down to around $5.00 – an initial decline of 50%.
Failure of its drug was all but guaranteed. Following the announcement of the failure, the stock now
trades for around $1.00.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 5/43


Today I am exposing very deep problems at Nymox Pharmaceutical . There are obvious
similarities between Nymox and my past homerun short trades, especially Tokai Pharma and
Force�eld Energy.


Nymox is another “no brainier short” which will soon go to true zero. Yes, zero. This is a
company with no value and basically no assets which has simply been pumped up on
promotional hype.


Nymox – recent developments


In late 2014, shares of Nymox Pharma had just rallied by 25% to over $5.00 as anticipation was
building for the results of its two Phase 3 trials for its NX-1207. The trials had been evaluating NX-1207
for use in treating Benign Prostatic Hyperplasia (“BPH”), otherwise known as an enlarged prostate.


Much of the share price strength had been due to a stream of positive press releases from Nymox
touting the strong prospects for NX-1207. Examples of these press releases are shown below.


Then on November 3rd, 2014, Nymox announced (https://globenewswire.com/news-
release/2014/11/02/678844/10105809/en/Nymox-NX-1207-BPH-Pivotal-Phase-3-U-S-Studies-NX02-
0017-and-NX02-0018-Fail-to-Meet-Primary-E�icacy-Endpoints.html) that both trials had both failed to
meet their primary endpoints. The stock immediately plunged by 85% to just 75 cents. It continued to
decline to as low as 39 cents in the subsequent weeks.


(Note: as I will demonstrate throughout this article, management was already aware that NX-1207 had
failed Phase 3 trials as far back as 6-12 months earlier. Instead of making timely disclosure of the
failure, management continued to put out bullish press releases touting the drug’s prospects. During
this time Nymox CEO Paul Averback aggressively sold millions of dollars worth of stock at in�ated
prices, while Nymox the company raised over $5 million from equity o�erings. No SEC disclosures of
the sales were made at the time).


Since the implosion in November of 2014, the shares have now recovered much of those losses, now
trading at around $3.20 In other words, the stock is now up by nearly 10x since its post-failure lows !


The key driver of the stock price rebound has once again been a series of NEW favorable press
releases under which the company seems to suddenly indicate that (contrary to previous disclosure)
the company’s only drug once again has bright prospects.


As I will demonstrate clearly below, the information in these press releases is deeply misleading.
Nymox’s only drug continues to be just as worthless as it was when the stock was trading at 39 cents.


With just 1% institutional holdings and zero research coverage, there has been almost no analysis of
the faulty information being disseminated by Nymox.


Investors should run (not walk) from this dubious biotech which has a long and sordid history of deeply
misleading shareholders as management dumps shares.


Company Overview


Nymox Pharma was founded in 1985 (yes, over 30 years ago) by CEO Dr. Paul Averback. During the
past 30 years, the company has pursued multiple business paths including various diagnostic tests as
well as several initial attempts at therapeutic drugs. It has never generated meaningful commercial
revenues. The company does generate a miniscule amount of revenue (less than $50,000 per quarter)
from sales of two diagnostic tests which test for the presence of nicotine in saliva or urine.


Looking at Nymox’s �nancials, it may appear that the company has generated a decent amount of
revenues over the past 5 years. However, this is absolutely, positively not the case.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 6/43


Back in 2010, Nymox signed a licensing agreement with Italy’s Recordati Pharma. Recordati paid
an upfront licensing fee (http://www.�ercebiotech.com/biotech/recordati-and-nymox-pharmaceutical-
corporation-announce-european-licensing-agreement-for-nx) of $13 million for European rights to
Nymox’s only drug, NX-1207. Over the years, Nymox has disclosed working on several di�erent drug
compounds, but NX-1207 is the only one that ever made it into any clinical trials. At the time of the
Recordati agreement, NX-1207 drug had just entered Phase 3 trials.


It is important to note that the $13 million in cash from Recordati is long since gone and Nymox now
has less than $1 million in cash. However, for accounting purposes the Recordati revenues were
recognized pro-rata over the subsequent 5 years. This gives the appearance that Nymox had
generated around $2-3 million per year in revenues. But again, this is for accounting purposes only.
Nymox generates less than $50,000 per quarter in revenue and now has less than $1 million in cash.
Nymox has never generated meaningful revenues from commercial sales of any product.


Following the 2014 failure of both Phase 3 trials, Recordati immediately terminated
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wfz.htm#1stPage) all development and commercialization activities
related to NX-1207.


As of 2016, we can see that Nymox is no longer recognizing these revenues for accounting purposes.
In Q1 of 2016, Nymox revenues (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.whn.d.htm#1stPage) amounted to just
$41,501.


As for cash, Nymox’s situation is dire. As of December 31, 2015
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.whn.d.htm#1stPage), the company was down to just $653,000 in cash.
The company did raise $2.1 million in a series of small private o�erings in February
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.whn.d.htm#1stPage). But by March 2016, it was again down to just
$831,000 in cash. (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.whn.d.htm#1stPage) Last year the company burned
$3.7 million in cash from operations.


Given its shaky �nancials and limited prospects, it is not surprising that there is virtually no institutional
investment in the company. Institutional ownership (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/nymx/institutional-
holdings)stands at just 1% of shares outstanding. There is no research coverage of Nymox. Share price
moves are entirely driven by retail day traders who play the latest headlines and press releases on the
stock.


Nymox has a long history of misleading investors – and then dumping stock at in�ated prices


My regular readers will remember that I have exposed multiple biotech stock promotions at companies
such as CytRx , Galena , Ziopharm , Northwest Bio and Tokai Pharma . These promotions shared many
similarities to what we now see at Nymox. This will be illustrated below.


Each of these companies was dominated by the participation of retail investors and each of them had
completed seemingly “promising” Phase 2 clinical trials. Many small investors relied heavily
upon numerous bullish press releases which appeared to presage almost certain success of their
drugs.


What many retail investors do not understand is that drugs do not “pass” Phase 2 and then proceed on
to Phase 3. The progression from Phase 2 to Phase 3 is simply a DECISION made by the company.
For companies running stock promotions, they will ALWAYS proceed to Phase 3, even when they know
that their drug doesn’t work. This is because having a drug in Phase 3 typically results in a share price
bump and allows the company to raise larger sums of money. We saw this exact phenomenon in each
of CytRx, Galena, Ziopham, Northwest Bio and Tokai. And we are now seeing it again with Nymox.

In each case, management aggressively touted the “compelling results” in Phase 2 in order to boost
the share price. When the share price bumped up, the companies could then raise more money and
enter partnerships with larger drug companies. Insiders would often sell stock.


Yet in each case, the Phase 2 trials were largely a sham. In each of may articles, I showed with a high
degree of certainty that each of these dugs stood almost no chance in Phase 3 trials. Yet
management chose to proceed to Phase 3 anyway. When Phase 3 results were released, they were a
dismal failure in each and every case. The share prices quickly plummeted by 60-80% in a single day.


Sadly, such misleading behavior is very common with small cap biotechs.


With no institutional investment and no research coverage, there is simply no mechanism to keep
Nymox honest. The day-to-day share price action is strictly dominated by retail day traders who play the
headlines and press releases of the company along with following “technical analysis” on places
like Twitter (https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=%24nymx).


Nymox (in particular CEO and founder Paul Averback) has a history of grossly misleading investors and
then dumping shares at in�ated prices.


During its 30 year history, past business descriptions
(http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.64H5.htm#1stPage) detailed the company’s primary pursuit of
Alzheimer’s related projects. This included a diagnostic testfor Alzheimer’s as well as several anti-
Alzheimer’s drugs (http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.64H5.htm#1stPage). Many years ago, Nymox had
also done very preliminary work on developing several anti-infective drugs
(http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.64H5.htm#1stPage). But these never went anywhere.


Even in the distant past, Nymox and CEO Averback have always been very aggressive in promotion.


With the Alzheimer’s test, Averback had once run an aggressive public ad stating that “Alzheimer’s–
Now you can rule it out“. An article in Bloomberg (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-03-
15/no-shortage-of-moxie-at-nymox) quickly described Averback’s ad as “misleading”, “unproven” and
“unsupported”.


According to Bloomberg:


Dr. Norman R. Relkin, an Alzheimer’s specialist who directs a memory-disorders program at
New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, says hawking the test to the public is
“reprehensible.” The Alzheimer’s Assn. derides Nymox’ “highly objectionable” sales e�orts
and advises against use of the test


Following such public criticism of his marketing tactics on the ine�ective test, Avervack then switched to
using “scienti�c meetings” to spread use of the test, funding studies conducted in hospitals which it said
were supportive.


Bloomberg (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-03-15/no-shortage-of-moxie-at-
nymox) concluded that:


In its rush to market, Nymox seems more interested in cashing in on the data it has rather than
learning more.


However, the e�ect of the public promotion by Averback had a strong e�ect and Nymox’s stock
soared from $2.45 to as high as $13.50, before ultimately crashing back to the $2’s.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 8/43


The issue here was that the Alzheimer’s test proved to be highly problematic.


Nymox’ test had demonstrated a disturbing rate of false positives
(http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-03-15/no-shortage-of-moxie-at-nymox) of 11%. At the
time, Harvard Medical School neurologist Peter Lansbury noted
(http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/1998-03-15/no-shortage-of-moxie-at-nymox): “A false
positive for Alzheimer’s is a nightmare.” It would end up preventing diagnosis for various other types
of impairment, which could have otherwise been treated if properly diagnosed.


In July of 2005, an FDA advisory panel (https://www.questia.com/magazine/1G1-137018198/fda-panel-
blocks-urine-test-for-alzheimer-s-test) voted 5 to 2 to block use of Nymox’s Alzhemer’s test. The
FDA ruled that the test was “non-approvable“.


By this time, the stock had declined back into the $2’s and Nymox’s cash balance
(http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.v1yv.htm#1stPage) was down to just $151,000. Nymox was broke.


With its Alzheimer’s test a failure, Nymox needed a new investment thesis to boost the stock price.
Nymox also desperately needed cash.


Keep in mind that Averback had already been running the company for 20 years and had so far failed to
ever generate more than a few hundred thousand in total annual revenues. Even these meager
revenues were simply the result of a 2000 acquisition of Serex, which marketed two diagnostic tests for
detecting nicotine in urine or saliva samples. At the bottom line, the company was losing $3.5 million
per year.


What was Averback supposed to do after 20 years, go out and get a real job ?!? No chance.


On the product side, Nymox soon began emphasizing a new direction for the company. Historical �lings
had all emphasized Nymox’s focus on Alzheimer’s, but in 2006 the company began to emphasize
(http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.u1D9.htm#1stPage) its new focus on BPH (enlarged prostate).


Nymox had originally been developing a whole series of compounds for Alzheimer’s, including NXD-
5150, NXD-9062, NXD- 1191 and NXD-3109. But none of these ever made it into clinical trials
(https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=nymox&Search=Search).


Instead, Nymox began pursuing NX-1207 for enlarged prostate (BPH). NX-1207
had inexplicably been developed directly (http://www.secinfo.com/dsvr4.4Fa8d.htm) from its work on
entirely unrelated the Alzhemier’s drugs, none of which showed enough promise to enter clinical trials.


To address the cash shortage, Nymox began relying more heavily on an o�shore �nancing agreement
conducted via obscure Panamanian shell company
(http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.z1yh.htm#1stPage), raising over $3 million by issuing stock at
discounted prices.


(Note: In the past, it has been my experience that the involvement of anonymous o�shore shell
companies in holdings shares has typically been for the purpose of concealing true ownership of the
shares as well as concealing the o�shore dumping of these shares. Such dumping often presages
massive plunges in the share price. This topic merits its own discussion and is addressed in the section
below. But for now, we could see that Nymox had temporarily solved its near term liquidity crisis via its
new Panamanian connection.)


Despite its curious beginnings as an unrelated Alzheimer’s drug, Nymox took NX-1207 through multiple
clinical trials for BPH.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 9/43


Throughout 2007 and 2008, Nymox began releasing a stream of positive press releases
(http://www.nymox.com/newsletter.action) touting strong results from Phase 2 clinical trials. Throughout
2008, the share price began to rise to over $5.00.


Based on strong Phase 2 results (according to Nymox), Nymox then took NX-1207 into Phase 3 trials.
And in 2010, Nymox announced a licensing deal with Italian pharma group Recordati.


The Pharma Times
(http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nymox_stock_soars_on_recordati_deal_981295) put out an article
noting:


Italian drugmaker Recordati is shelling out 10 million euros [US$13 million] for access to US
group Nymox Pharmaceutical’s experimental enlarged prostate drug NX-1207 in Europe,
causing the latter’s shares to rocket more than 60%.


Misleading investors while secretly dumping stock


During this time, Nymox continued to put forth very aggressive and positive press releases. (A list of
these is provided below). Because of the Recordati investment and the positive PR, Nymox’s share
price had soared back to almost $10 by 2011.


As the stream of hyper bullish press releases continued, CEO Averback was quietly selling millions of
shares (http://securities.stanford.edu/�lings-
documents/1053/NPC00_01/20141124_f01c_14CV07331.pdf) without ever �ling any SEC forms to
disclose the sales. From SEC �lings, the only way that anyone would know that Averback had sold
would be to compare each annual form 20F to the previous year’s 20F and then do the math. This is
further complicated by the fact that Averback has often awarded himself additional shares, which
obscures the impact of his share sales.


Looking back, we can see that as of March 2011, CEO Averback owned 13.1 million shares
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.p56.htm#1stPage). But by March of 2013, this number had declined
to 12.2 million shares (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.x5a.htm#1stPage). Averback had therefore
disposed of nearly a million shares when the share price was ranging from $7 to nearly $10, netting him
at least $6-8 million in proceeds. As shown below, while he was selling, Nymox had put out more than a
dozen bullish press releases on NX-1207.


As described in a subsequent lawsuit, in November 2013, Nymox completed enrollment for its �rst
Phase 3 trial (http://securities.stanford.edu/�lings-
documents/1053/NPC00_01/20141124_f01c_14CV07331.pdf) of NX-1207. Nymox did not make any
disclosure of the results.(Note: as with most securities lawsuits, the suit was ultimately dismissed.)


Even prior to the failure, biotech journalist Adam Feuerstein from TheStreet.com was the �rst
to highlight (https://www.thestreet.com/story/12775982/2/biotech-stock-mailbag-acelrx-yellen-aftermath-
nymox.html) when these trials had already been completed as well as the fact that the results were well
overdue. Investors refused to listen.


Investors had no idea, but as early as November 2013 (and certainly by May of 2014), Averback
would have been fully informed that the �rst trial of NX-1207 had failed.


Rather than disclose this information to the public, Averback continued selling his shares of Nymox at
in�ated prices. Again, there was no direct SEC disclosure at the time of the share sales to US investors.
Even though Averback knew that the trial had failed, he continued to have Nymox issue positive press
releases on NX-1207.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 10/43


By March of 2014, Averback’s share ownership was down to 11.4 million shares
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.n2j.htm#1stPage). CEO Averback had therefore sold over 800,000
additional shares at prices of $5-8, again netting him millions of dollars in additional personal
proceeds. And again we saw numerous bullish press releases touting NX-1207 at the exact time
Averback was dumping his stock.


By May 2014, Nymox’s second Phase 3 trial was completed (http://securities.stanford.edu/�lings-
documents/1053/NPC00_01/20141124_f01c_14CV07331.pdf). It was a failureand Averback would
have been fully informed of this. Again, Averback refused to disclose the failure of the Phase 3 trial to
investors until 6 months later, during which time he continued selling shares.


By March of 2015, Averback’s holdings were down to 10.9 million shares
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.m3w.htm#1stPage). He had therefore sold another 500,00 shares. But
since there is no SEC disclosure of dates, we cannot prove how many of this last 500,000 shares were
sold prior to disclosing the failure of the Phase 3 trials. Given that he knew of the drugs complete
failure, and given his past behavior, I am assuming he sold his shares before disclosing the failure to
the public.


But wait, it gets worse.


Averback wasn’t just focused on lining his own pockets. Instead, he had the company start aggressively
issuing new shares to raise money that it would badly need once the trial failure became public. The
shares were issued to an anonymous o�shore Panamanian buyer, which would then sell them into the
market. Again, no disclosure of any such sales were made at the time.


From the subsequent 20F �ling (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.m3w.htm#1stPage) (released a year
later), we can see a list of the share issuances which started in December 2013. We can see that the
share sales aggressively continued even after the second trial failure in May of 2014. Clearly the sale
prices were (obviously) signi�cantly above the sub-$1 levels where the stock ended up once the trails
failures were disclosed.


– December 18, 2013, 48,544 common shares were issued at a price of $6.18 per share.


– January 14, 2014, 69,686 common shares were issued at a price of $5.74 per share.

– October 24, 2014, 50,040 common shares were issued at a price of $5.00 per share.


Under those drawings, Nymox received over $5 million in proceeds. The majority of these
drawings occurred at a time when Averback knew with 100% certainty that the trials had failed.


As soon as the Phase 3 failures were announced, the share price plunged. But Nymox had already
raised $5 million for its own use and Averback had personally pocketed at least $15 million for
himself.


After pocketing the $15 million, and with the share price in tatters, Averback then announced that he
would be “forfeiting” his $290,000 salary to help the company preserve cash. But he then also awarded
himself 3 million new shares (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wfz.htm#1stPage)upfront. This happens
to be roughly the amount he had sold before disclosing the Phase 3 failures. So basically, after selling
the 3 million shares for $15 million, he then got all of those shares back – for free.


Next, he then also set the company up to issue him an additional 250,000 shares per month
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wfz.htm#1stPage) for up to 7 years !! The justi�cation for this massive
award was that he was forgoing his $290,000 salary. But keep in mind that this would total a
whopping 21 million shares (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wfz.htm#1stPage) ! Even at the
distressed prices at the time of the award, the company valued these awards at $21.2 million. At
current prices, they would be valued at over $60 million. This is how Averback compensated himself for
forfeiting his mere $290,000 salary.


So Averback has already cashed out of at least $15 million personally. Due to the recent share price
rise, his current holdings are now worth an additional $60-70 million. And with the additional shares he
receives each month, he is set to receive up to $80 million more.


No bad for a company which has never even generated meaningful revenues over its 30 year history.


Included is a list of the press releases that Averback was putting out in the time that he was dumping
his shares. Notice that a good number of these bullish releases occurred AFTER he was well aware
that NX-1207 had failed Phase 3 trials.

Nymox disclosure – going from “very bad” to “completely preposterous”


As stock promotions go, Averback had turned Nymox from a complete failure into quite a success. He
managed to personally pocket at least $15 millionhimself simply by selling stock at in�ated prices
before disclosing the drug failures. This alone was more than the total cumulative revenues of
Nymox in its entire 30 year history !


But Averback wasn’t done. In fact, he was just beginning. Now that he was awarding himself millions of
additional shares, he now had a massive incentive to get the share price back up.


And in fact, with nearly $100 million worth of stock at prevailing low prices, the real incentive is
to simply get the VOLUME up just so he could sell more stock even at the low prices.


But there were already a series of lawsuits (https://globenewswire.com/news-

company following the share price implosion.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 15/43


The �rst thing he did was to re-domicile the company to the Bahama’s
(https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/08/04/757664/0/en/Nymox-Announces-Change-of-
Company-s-Domicile-and-Head-O�ice.html) in 2015. Now he would continue to bene�t from the
minimal disclosure requirements, but Nymox would also be largely insulated from the legal
consequences of his stock promotion.


Subsequent to changing its domicile, the next 20F noted the company no longer had any stated
business purpose or any restrictions on what business it may choose to carry out:


our articles of incorporation are on �le with the Acting Registrar General of the Commonwealth
of The Bahamas under Corporation Number 175894 (NYSE:B
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/B)). Our articles of incorporation do not include a stated
purpose and do not place any restrictions on the business that the Corporation may
carry on.


Nymox has institutional holdings of just 1%. The majority of outside shares appear to be simply owned
in small lots by scattered retail investors. Yet somehow the vote garnered the support
(https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/08/04/757664/0/en/Nymox-Announces-Change-of-
Company-s-Domicile-and-Head-O�ice.html) of 94% of these scattered shareholders.


Such a move to an o�shore secrecy haven would clearly disadvantage shareholders. That Nymox
could somehow garner such strong support for such a detrimental motion seems like a stretch. In fact,
even getting a 94% turnout for such a retail-only stock should be nearly impossible. Locating
thousands of small investors and getting them to actually vote would have been quite a
challenge.


But as we will see, Nymox’s o�shore Panama connection may mean that there are concentrated
pockets of ownership which are not re�ected in any company disclosure. This would easily explain how
Nymox could obtain overwhelming approval for such a detrimental motion.


This is just my observation and opinion, it remains to be proven. In fact, this could be the single most
interesting part of the Nymox promotion story, so keep this aspect in mind as we proceed.


Re-igniting the promotion from the Bahamas


As soon Averback got the company re-domiciled to the Bahamas in 2015, the immediate next step was
to re-ignite the stock promotion.


What Nymox did next was to “re-evaluate” the failed Phase 3 data in what it referred to as a
“prospective extension study”. It was just 8 months after the dismal failure of its two Phase 3 trials. But
this simpli�ed “new look” at the data ended now ended up pointing to an overwhelming success
(http://www.nymox.com/resources/content/d244.pdf) with NX-1207 showing dramatic bene�t vs.
placebo. Just 8 months earlier, NX-1207 had showed little to no bene�t vs. placebo.


To be clear, this was not a new study. It was simply “data mining” using data from the existing failed
Phase 3 studies. The failed data and various subsets can simply be mined and re-analyzed over and
over again until a something resembling a positive result is �nally obtained.


In any event, this “prospective extension study” of existing data allowed the now-Bahamian Nymox to
put out an explosive press release (http://www.nymox.com/resources/content/d244.pdf) which single
handedly dove the share price up by 125%. (http://www.�ercebiotech.com/biotech/nymox-soars-after-

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 16/43


Fierce Biotech (http://www.�ercebiotech.com/biotech/nymox-soars-after-claims-of-a-post-phiii-bph-
turnaround?utm_campaign=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_source=rss) cautioned that:


Additional new blinded protocol data from the same pivotal studies is being prospectively
captured in order to assess long-term results in patients up to 5 years after a single injection of
NX-1207 2.5 mg vs placebo,” said CEO Paul Averback at the time….


There’s no word on what the FDA’s position will be on “prospectively captured” data like
this.


In that explosive press release Nymox promised that:


The Company now intends to meet with authorities and to proceed to �le where possible in due
course for regulatory approvals for fexapotide tri�utate in various jurisdictions and territories.


The chances that the FDA allows Nymox a “do-over” on two Phase 3 trials due to after-the-fact
data mining are basically zero.


Fierce Biotech had noted speci�cally that:


The general rule of thumb in biotech is that an unblinded Phase III failure is hard to get
around. You can mount a new study or give up.


Quite obviously Nymox does not have the cash to mount a new study, which is why it simply sat and
“re-analyzed” the old data until it found a subset that looked positive.


But the press release was a quick and easy way for Nymox to rally retail day traders and get the share
price moving again. The ruse clearly worked due to the all retail nature of the investor base and the
notable lack of analyst coverage to interpret the �ndings.


In reality, NX-1207 for BPH is dead. It failed both of its Phase 3 trials and no amount of after-the-fact
“prospective data capture” is going to change that.


Case in point, a full year has now passed and there has not been a single update as to any progress on
NX-1207 for BPH or any supposed discussion with the FDA. Not even a single new press release on
BPH.


Instead, Nymox has shifted the focus to using NX-1207 for a totally di�erent application. This time it
is as an actual treatment for prostate cancer. Towards the end of 2015, Nymox began putting out
preliminary early announcements of results in its Phase 2 trials for NX-1207 in treating prostate cancer.


As was the case in years past with the Phase 2 trials for BPH, the press releases were emphatically
glowing about the strong prospects for NX-1207 in treating prostate cancer.


On February 9th, Nymox announced (http://www.nymox.com/resources/content/d260.pdf) the results of
the Phase 2 trial. Not surprisingly, the results were stated in a way that was overwhelmingly positive.


It was clear from the press release that “The trial commenced in February 2012” and that “The study
lasted 40 months overall from the �rst patient randomized to the last patient 18 month endpoints.”


So you do the math. This means that Nymox already had the result of this study for 8 months
before releasing the data.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 17/43


This is funny because just a few days BEFORE releasing the data, Nymox conducted another �nancing
(http://www.nymox.com/resources/content/d258.pdf) whereby it issued $2.1 million of new shares to
what it described as “long-term Nymox shareholders”.


At the time, Nymox did not disclose the names of the investors nor did it disclose the price at which
the investment was made.


The point is this: Nymox already knew the results of the Phase 2 study for 8 months and it
chose to sell $2.1 million of new shares at some unspeci�ed discount to unnamed existing
investors just days before releasing the positive press release. It was a true sweetheart deal. It
was literally like handing the unnamed investor a pile of free money.


As expected, the share price immediately soared on 10x normal volume due to the glowing press
release.


But the gains were not going to last.


Shortly after the glowing press release, independent websites focused on prostate cancer began to see
the claims being made by Nymox. And this is where the latest problems began.


Website Prostate Cancer Info Link (https://prostatecancerinfolink.net/2016/02/09/nymox-claims-
success-in-phase-ii-trial-of-nx-1207-in-low-risk-prostate-cancer/) focuses exclusively on prostate cancer
issues. The site is sophisticated and features detailed articles, video presentations, a daily blog and an
interactive mentoring service. The site found immediate problems with Nymox’s press release.


Referencing Nymox’s Phase 2 protocol, the site noted that:


Now, as we have indicated all along, there are very serious questionsabout whether any of
these patients actually needed treatment at allat the time that they were initially entered into
this study, so it is di�icult to ascertain exactly what the real bene�t is (or is not) from this
form of treatment.


You take a group of men who show no indication that they need treatment. You treat many
of them (although it is unclear from the media release or the study summary on
ClinicalTrials.gov whether the patients were randomized to one or other of the three study
arms or how many patients were enrolled in each of the three arms), and then you claim
success without providing any data on the numbers of patients who are said not to need
surgery or radiation therapy … and all this with a drug that has no side e�ects.


Now if these were results in men with even favorable, intermediate-risk prostate cancer (i.e.,
clinical stage T1c or T2a, PSA ≤ 10, a Gleason score of 3 + 4 = 7), then one might be able to
see what the fuss was about, but the patients enrolled in this trial were so low risk that
giving them the drug might have had nothing to do with the actual outcomesdescribed!


We should be clear that, at this time, there is no randomized Phase III clinical trial in
progress or scheduled to test the e�ectiveness and safety of NX-1207 in prostate cancer.


In other words, these �ndings basically invalidated the entire glowing press release from Nymox as
being nearly irrelevant. It was a sham (just like the Phase 2 BPH trials from years past).


From February 2016 until June 2016, the share price stayed range bound in the range of $2-3. There
was simply no news to drive the stock.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 18/43


Then on June 22nd, Nymox put out yet another explosive press release
(https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/06/22/850637/0/en/Nymox-Reports-Long-Term-
Prostate-Cancer-Results-in-7-Year-Prospective-Study-of-995-U-S-Middle-Aged-and-Elderly-Men-
Without-Cancer.html) detailing the results from another “prospective study” of the failed Phase 3 BPH
data.


Of all the recent press releases, this press release was the worst. It was the least
substantiated and the least rigorous. Yet the language in it was by far the most extreme.


The press release simply noted that:


These results are astonishingly good


Nymox went on to point out that “The expected rate of new prostate cancer in the U.S. general male
population in this age group is in the 5-20% range after 7 year”. It then stated that the observed rate for
those who had received NX-1207 was just 1.3%.


This simpli�ed high level summary is what caused the share price to soar.


But in fact, this latest press release contained pure hyperbole and virtually no data with which to back it
up. First o�, it seems clear that many retail traders misinterpreted the release as if it were clinical trial
results, which it is not. Again, this is a simply a rehash of old data from the failed Phase 3 BPH studies
from 2014. Nymox didn’t even include the most basic of information from this “prospective study”,
such as what age range was used or even basic statistical information such as means, medians, p
values or baseline characteristics.


And in fact, it was noted that:


All men were thoroughly evaluated to exclude any prostate cancer prior to qualifying for
enrollment in the studies.


So the fact that the incidence of prostate cancer in this group was very low should have
been EXPECTED, and not a surprise.


But after years of using the same playbook, such an aggressive press release from Nymox should have
come as expected. Here is an example of a previous glowing Phase 2 press release
(https://csn.cancer.org/node/243248) on the soon-to-fail NX-1207 for BPH.


Here is the worst part:


Like the most recent press releases, it o�ers strong assurances and praise for NX-1207 from di�erent
expert urologists who seem to assure us of NX-1207’s promising future.


One of these doctors who has regularly touted Nyomx is Dr. Ronald Tutrone.


Dr. Tutrone is the one who was responsible for the comment stating that “These results are
astonishingly good”. His credentials appear to be quite strong and the quote was very forceful. This is
likely what sent the stock soaring.


Given that Averback owns millions of shares of Nymox, his own bias and self interest should be obvious
to any investor.

However, Tutrone appears to be just an outside doctor who is “astonished’ by the great results for NX-
1207. In the press release, there is no disclosure of stock ownership or funding by Nymox to
Tutrone.


Yet for those who are willing to dig deep enough, we can see that as part of a totally separate ASCO
abstract (https://coi.asco.org/Report/ViewAbstractCOI?id=163759), Dr. Tutrone had been required to
disclose his stock ownerships and funding relationships with various companies.


Not only has Dr. Tutrone previously disclosed that he received direct funding, but he also disclosed
personally owning Nymox shares. Again, no mention of these con�icts was made in the recent
aggressive press releases which sent Nymox soaring.


This disclosure was not easy to �nd. I am a professional researcher who specializes in biotech stocks
and I knew exactly what I was looking for. Yet it still took me days to �nd this disclosure from Tutrone.
There is simply no way that small retail investors could be expected to �nd such disclosure.

The Panama connection – why you should be concerned


Over the years I have learned to pay particular attention to the presence of anonymous o�shore shell
companies when they appear as shareholders in dubious small cap companies. Sometimes it takes a
bit of extra e�ort to identify these entities, but it is certainly well worth the e�ort.


In past cases, it was the presence of these hidden o�shore entities that presaged the rapid implosion
of the share price. This is because these are often anonymous o�shore entities who don’t disclose
how much stock they own or when they are selling. Once they start dumping stock, the share price
simply implodes. Bystander investors are left wondering what happened. In most cases they will never
know.


Note that there is no way to prove this until well after the fact, so for now it remains just my opinion
based on past experience.


I saw this to dramatic e�ect when I exposed fraudulent Force�eld Energy , which had been trading at
around $7.50. Following my article, that stock imploded by 60% in 3 days before being halted. When it
reopened, it immediately traded down to just pennies. The reason why was clearly the dumping of
shares held by anonymous o�shore entities in Belize. More details are provided on this below.


With Nymox, the company disclosed the involvement of an o�shore Panamanian shell company named
Lorros-Greyse Investments to provide �nancing to the �nancially strapped company. The earliest
reference (http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.29v.htm?Find=lorros#14thPage) to Lorros-Greyse appears in
2003, which is the inception of Nymox’s agreement with Lorros.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 20/43


Initially the arrangement called for Lorros to purchase up to $5 million of new shares
(http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.29v.htm#1stPage) from Nymox at discounted prices. That agreement
was quickly superseded by a new agreement for up to an additional $12 million in stock
(http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.117z.htm?Find=lorros&Line=12108#Line12108). Then there was a
subsequent agreement for up to an additional $13 million (http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.uxv.c.htm?
Find=lorros&Line=38#Line38). Then another $15 million (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.r6w.htm?
Find=lorros&Line=1311#Line1311).


We can see from the formation documents (http://ohuiginn.net/panama/company/id/428989) that
Lorros-Greyse was actually formed within just days of the beginning of this arrangement with Nymox.
We can also see that over the past 13 years there are no other references online or in SEC documents.
With Lorros-Greyse, there has been no other activity and no involvement with any other company
other than Nymox. EVER.


The point is that Lorros-Greyse is simply an anonymous o�shore sell company which was set
up speci�cally to run the Nymox transactions and for no other purpose. It has been my observation
that such anonymous shell companies are used to hide three things: the identity of the ultimate share
holder, the size of their position, and the actual selling activity.


As an o�shore entity, all sales to Lorros-Greyse were made pursuant to AN EXEMPTION FROM SEC
REGISTRATION (http://www.secinfo.com/dRC12.29v.htm?Find=lorros#1stPage). Likewise, any sales
by Lorros-Greyse would be unregistered o�shore sales as well. They would be invisible to US
shareholders, even though they would certainly impact the share price of Nymox stock in the
marketplace.


Lorros-Greyse has no purpose other than acquiring and disposing of shares in Nymox. There has never
been any other activity or reference to Lorros-Greyse. But by tracking down the nominee directors of
Lorros-Greyse we can identify their activities in other similar companies.


It should come as no surprise that the other companies which w can tie to Lorros-Greyse
have imploded to the pennies.


Note that the named directors are nominee directors only. They are NOT the bene�cial owners who
control the stock. The real owners are hidden.


For example, Viewpoint Investment Corp is another anonymous o�shore Panamanian shell company.
We can see from its formation documents (http://ohuiginn.net/panama/company/id/637353) that it has
nearly identical directors as Lorros-Greyse.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 21/43


(http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.x8Qy.htm?Find=viewpoint&Line=1487#Line1487) and then sold
o�shore using exemptions form US securities laws (http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.x8Qy.htm?
Find=viewpoint&Line=1487#Line1487). At the time of its reverse merger, 3Power was trading at $2.48.
Since that time it has collapsed to just 8 cents. Despite owning nearly 20 million shares, Viewpoint
never disclosed owning these shares in any SEC �lings. It also never disclosed when it sold (dumped)
these shares. Anyone still holding onto shares of 3Power is simply left wondering what the heck
happened to cause such an implosion.


Dianeth M. De Ospino is listed as a director of both Lorros and Viewpoint. She is also a director for
another Panamanian entity called Opunosa Investment
(http://www.secinfo.com/duhPy.vh.htm#1stPage), whose sole purpose was to acquire and dispose of
millions of shares in a company called World Gaming
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13eFe.vkf.htm#1stPage). Opunosa has not disclosed any sales of shares in
World Gaming, however the share price has now imploded to just factions of one penny. Again,
uninformed investors in World Gaming get to simply wonder what happened.


THE POINT IS THIS:


Lorros-Greyse is Viewpoint and is also Opunosa. It is all the same exact thing. They even use the same
Panamanian law �rm, Morgan & Morgan (http://ohuiginn.net/panama/company/id/428989).


Morgan & Morgan received a “dishonorable mention” from The Economist
(http://www.economist.com/news/�nance-and-economics/21696998-mossack-fonseca-and-its-
homeland-are-not-alone-facing-closer-scrutiny-who-next) in an article entitled “Who’s Next ?”. The
focus of the article was on “incorporation mills” in Panama. Such �rms received heavy attention this
year upon release of “The Panama Papers (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panama_Papers)” which
detailed how many international politicians were using Panamanian entities to hide ill gotten assets and
conduct illegal activities.


The Economist noted:


other incorporation mills face more scrutiny too, among them Panama’s other big law �rms,
such as Morgan & Morgan, and OIL, part of Hong-Kong-based Vistra, which caters primarily to
Chinese customers. Like Mossack, these are wholesalers. They sell shell companies in blocks
to law �rms and banks, which sell them on to the end client, sometimes via other retailers.


The presence of anonymous o�shore shell companies is a screaming red �ag – DANGER !


A while back I exposed problems (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-force�eld-energy-

plunged by more than 30% on the day of my article and management quickly issued a forceful
response (https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/04/17/725728/10129523/en/ForceField-
Energy-to-Address-the-Recent-Trading-Activity-of-Its-Common-Stock.html) against me. Force�eld
claimed that it had requested that I be investigated by regulators and stated that:


“We are not going to stand by and allow our Company, o�icers and directors, employees and
shareholders to continue to su�er through what appears to be an orchestrated short selling attack
based on misinformation”.


In putting out this press release, management was simply telling the latest in a string of lies that it had
told to shareholders.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 22/43


Force�eld promised to give shareholders a full business update on the company on the following
Monday. In the meantime, the share price continued to plunge on massive volume and was quickly
down by 60%. But when Monday rolled around, the only update the company could give was that the
Chairman of Force�eld had been arrested by the FBI (http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-
04-20/force�eld-energy-ex-chairman-said-to-be-charged-in-conspiracy) at Miami International Airport,
as he was trying to �ee the country, following my article.


Again, this all happened within 3 days of my article exposing the fraud at ForceField. For those who
have time, I recommended re-reading that article, as it provides some good hints on how to spot
impending frauds.


An early tipo� that Force�eld likely had major problems was the existence of numerous
transactions and arrangements in o�shore havens such as Panama, Belize and Costa Rica.


Just like Nymox, Force�eld appeared to have institutional investment of just 1% of outstanding shares.
It appeared that 99% of the stock was spread out in the hands of retail investors. But we can see from
the subsequent implosion that this was not the case at all.


According to the Justice Department complaint:


St. Julien [The Chairman] did not disclose his ownership and control of the
shares purchased through nominees and used o�shore banks, including in Belize, to pay the
nominees to conceal his ownership and control. St. Julien coordinated the purchases by
telephone and text messages…. Through his scheme, St. Julien and his co-conspirators
deceived the investing public by creating the appearance of genuine trading volume and
interest in ForceField’s stock


The FBI ended up indicting (https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nine-individuals-including-�ve-
registered-brokers-indicted-orchestrating-131-million) nine individuals in a $131 million fraud scheme
which involved payo�s using brown bags �lled with cash as well as disposable cell phones and content-
expiring messaging applications in an attempt to avoid tracing,


The indictment (https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/nine-individuals-including-�ve-registered-brokers-
indicted-orchestrating-131-million) noted that:


They took a company with essentially no business operations and little revenue and
deceived the market and their clients into believing it was worth hundreds of millions of
dollars through a dizzying round of unauthorized trades and deceptive promotions.


(Hint: In my opinion, this sounds quite a bit like Nymox).


Within just a few trading days of my article, Force�eld had collapsed by nearly 100%. The only
explanation for this is that the ownership of Force�eld stock was far more concentrated than the
supposed “1% institutional interest” would indicate. When these undisclosed holders chose to sell,
they dumped massive amounts of stock, crushing the share price. These large, undisclosed, o�shore
holders were invisible to the rest of us. But they knew more than anyone that the company had no
cash and no business prospects. Even after the share price had plunged by 50%, these holders
were still willing to sell at any price, because they knew that the stock was ultimately worthless.


Based on my experience with Force�eld, I think I have every reason to have similar concerns about
Nymox and its use of anonymous o�shore Panamanian entities to conduct its �nancings. Given that the
transactions are unregistered, we have no idea who is behind Lorros, how many shares they may still

hold, when they are selling or how much.


The recent “sweetheart” �nancing deal in February to another anonymous investor only adds to my
concern.


A history of using troubled auditors favored by pump and dumps and stock promotions


Many years ago, Nymox had all the appearances of a legitimate company. It had a single drug in two
Phase 3 trials, it had accumulated a decent cash balance via its licensing deal with Recordati and it was
audited by Big 4 auditor KPMG.


But as soon as the truth came out regarding the failed Phase 3 trials of NX-1207, everything
changed. Fast.


We already saw that the share price imploded by more than 80% to just pennies. Almost immediately
thereafter, two long term board members (Roger Guy and Jack Gemmell) resigned
(http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.m3w.htm#1stPage).


The cash had long since run out. Nymox was down to around $600,000 is cash and had a working
capital de�cit of $580,000. Over the prior year it had burned over $5 million in cash.


KPMG then found material weaknesses (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.m3w.htm#1stPage) in
Nymox’s internal controls. As of 2016, these material weaknesses have still not been remedied.


Thayer O’Neal and the revolving door of troubled auditors


Nymox was then forced to �nd a new auditor. Nymox initially settled with little known Cutler & Co. But
following Cutler’s deregistering
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018735/000117625615000387/nymoxPharma6k.htm) with
the PCAOB, Nymox ended up with the audit �rm of Thayer O’Neal
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1018735/000117625615000387/nymoxPharma6k.htm).


Thayer O’Neal is basically an auditor for failed penny stock promotions. Both John Thayer and Thomas
“Mickey” O’Neal had been partners (http://www.pr.com/press-release/630469) at a �rm called LL
Bradford. LL Bradford had just merged with
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/822746/000107878215000083/f8k012015_8k.htm) another
little deeply troubled auditor called RBSM. The PCAOB had conducted a detailed inspection of RBSM
(https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Documents/2015-RBSM.pdf) in 2014, �nding numerous deep
auditing de�ciencies. That report was not released until 2015, at which time the troubled RBSM simply
merged with troubled LL Bradford.


LL Bradford itself was then shut down 7 months ago when the PCAOB censured the �rm and revoked
its registration (https://pcaobus.org/Enforcement/Decisions/Documents/LL-Bradford.pdf), stating:


the Firm [LL Bradford] repeatedly violated PCAOB rules, auditing standards, and quality
control standards and, in connection with several of those audits, also violated Section 10A(g)
and Section 10A(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) and Exchange Act
Rule 10A-2 concerning auditor independence.


These are very serious violations and as a result, LL Bradford was shut down completely.


Partners Thayer and O’Neal then simply started a new �rm, changed the name and picked up LL
Bradford/RBSM’s troubled former clients. As a result, the “new �rm” quickly assembled a roster of failed
penny stock promotions.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 24/43


From his LinkedIn page (https://www.linkedin.com/in/mickeyoneal), partner Thomas “Mickey” O’Neal
clearly describes his “new” �rm as just a “spin o�” of the defunct LL Bradford and RBSM.


In other words, this is just a revolving door of faulty audit practices. When the PCAOB shuts one down,
the partners just put a new name on the door and keep performing the same poor audits for the same
troubled clients.


Aside from Nymox, this is who the “new �rm” Thayer O’Neal audits. It is simply a collection of
failed stock promotions which were previously audited by LL Bradford / RBSM and which trade
for just pennies.

THE POINT IS THIS:


Nymox has basically picked an auditor who’s past history shows that it is among the worst of

predecessors were simply shut down by the PCAOB.


Thayer O’Neal simply adopted a new name and continued to audit the same companies.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 25/43


This existing client list shows that Thayer O’Neal is the auditor of choice for failed penny stock
promotions which trade for just a few cents and with no meaningful market value. Nymox
appears to be the ONLY EXCEPTION to this pattern – for now.


Nymox’s legal counsel charged with running other stock frauds


From the recent equity prospectus (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wdb.htm#1stPage) in February
2016, we can see that Nymox is being represented by Zouvas & Associates LLP.


We are being represented by Zouvas & Associates LLP; the validity of the securities being
o�ered by this prospectus and legal matters relating to applicable laws will be passed upon for
us by Zouvas & Associates LLP.


Zouvas’ name also appears in previous Nymox SEC �lings.


Anyone who is familiar with this name will immediately start hitting the “sell” button before reading any
further.


Just a few months ago (April 2016), Luke Zouvas was charged by the SEC
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2016/comp23526-zouvas.pdf) in a massive fraud case
involving a “sham IPO (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23526.htm)” and “subsequent
pump and dump (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2016/lr23526.htm)” with Crown Dynamics
Corp (OTC:CDYY (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDYY)). That company has since been renamed
Airware Labs (OTCPK:AIRW (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/AIRW)). Promotion had driven the stock
to nearly $3.00. It now trades for just 9 cents.


A read of the SEC charges (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2016/comp23526-
zouvas.pdf) reveals striking similarities to what we see going on at Nymox.


The history of Nymox’s attorney Zouvas’ in orchestrating stock fraud / promotion is extensive.


Zouvas had previously been a partner (http://www.bloomberg.com/pro�les/companies/8304446L:US-
carrillo-huettel-&-zouvas-llp) in the �rm Carrillo Huettel & Zouvas Llp. Luis Carrillo was then busted by
the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513254) for running
an international pump and dump scheme using Canadian stock promoters
(https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513254) and Bahamas based
brokers (https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513254).


(Hint: Once again, this sounds a lot like Nymox)


But in reality, Carrillo and his cohorts used a variety of o�shore locations (in addition to the Bahamas) to
run stock promotions. Carrillo was also featured in a very informative article entitled:


$500 MILLION BELIZE PENNY STOCK MANIPULATION RING SHUT DOWN
(http://promotionstocksecrets.com/500-million-belize-penny-stock-manipulation-ring-shut/)


(For those who wish to understand the mechanics of o�shore stock promotion, I highly recommend
reading that article.)


Nymox’s attorney Zouvas separated from Carrillo to found his own �rm, which also focused on stock
promotions. His brother Mark is an accountant (http://www.4-traders.com/business-leaders/Mark-
Zouvas-002SD3-E/biography/) who often runs the books. Up until the recent SEC charges, it had been
a great recipe for stock promotion success.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 26/43


Examples include the now bankrupt Reostar Energy. The ensuing lawsuit
(http://www.law360.com/articles/330101/greenberg-traurig-ducks-reostar-energy-conspiracy-
claims)noted that:


An alleged under-the-table deal between former CEO Mark Zouvas and several investors to
sell the company’s credit line at a low ball price was approved after the board of directors was
misled… the deal designed to skim millions of dollars to Zouvas.


Other past Zouvas promotions include Bold Energy (Pending:BOLD
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/BOLD)) which eventually became the stock Lot78 (OTCPK:LOTE
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LOTE)). Nymox’s attorney Luke Zouvas acted as the attorney
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1Feb4.n1t.htm?Find=zouvas&Line=4295#Line4295) in the deal.


Similar to Nymox, Lot78 was a low priced penny stock which soared to over $4.00 due to stock
promotion and bullish press releases. Just like Nymox, Lot78 had minimal revenues, was largely out
of cash and had virtually no institutional investment. Yet the share price rose on retail hype alone.


An article on Seeking Alpha came out, exposing the promotion, entitled:


Lot78 Inc: Why This $240 Million Company Could Drop By 75% Or More
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/1375581-lot78-inc-why-this-240-million-company-could-drop-by-75-
percent-or-more)


In fact, this was a dramatic understatement. Zouvas’Lot78 has since plunged to just fractions of
one penny. It is e�ectively a zero.


Nymox’s attorney Zouvas was also subpoenaed (https://www.goodetrades.com/2013/01/does-zouvas-
subpoena-spell-the-end-for-the-usgt-pump-and-dump/) regarding USA Graphite (OTC:USGT
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/USGT)), which has also plunged from over $4.00 to just fractions of
one penny.


So the list of Zouvas promotions is long, and in each and every case the stocks end up imploding:

THE KEY POINT:

SEEING WITH NYMOX, THERE HAVE BEEN PAST PROMOTIONSWHICH DROVE THE STOCKS
SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER.


IN ADDITION TO THE INVOLVEMENT ON ZOUVAS, THE OBVIOUS COMMON THEMES HERE ARE


· LACK OF MATERIAL REVENUES
· LACK OF CASH
· LACK MEANINGFUL INSTITUTIONAL INVESTMENT.
· A STREAM OF BULLISH PRESS RELEASES


(IN OTHER WORDS, EACH OF THE ABOVE ZOUVAS PROMOTIONS ARE JUST LIKE NYMOX.)


The explosive rise in Nymox following several dubious press releases is no coincidence. Here
are past examples of Zouvas promotions:

USA Graphite (http://stockreich.com/the-chimerical-radiance-of-usa-graphite-inc-otcusgt/), 2013


USA Graphite Inc. has been in the top ladder of OTC Markets activity statistics for the last

USGT stock has hit $0.87 per share which is nearly double its value from one month ago.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 29/43


After shares traded for less than $1.50 on Wednesday, they ended the week at more than $6.
There was no news to justify the price soaring.


Nymox’s banker of choice – Chardan Capital Markets


History has shown us that when Chardan says “BUY” the wisest move is to quickly hit “SELL“.


In February, Nymox �led a 424B5 prospectus (http://www.secinfo.com/d13Smf.wdb.htm#1stPage) with
the SEC hoping to raise up to $12 million by issuing new shares. This is the most recent document
naming Zouvas at Nymox’s attorney. It also named Chardan Capital Markets as Nymox’s banker.


The timing of the prospectus also happened to coincide with Nymox issuing a new bullish press
release. Nymox clearly wanted to be prepared to issue more stock if the share price soared.


Chardan was originally founded by Dr. Richard Propper, later getting his son Kerry Proper involved.


Chardan and its founders have a very long, long list of securities law violations going back decades and
yet somehow the �rm stays in business. Even a cursory Google search reveals multiple SEC and
FINRA disclosure events / violations (http://broker-dealers.credio.com/l/1312/Chardan-Capital-Markets-
LLC). Here is one recent detailed example
(https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/content/marketregulation/NASDAQ/DisciplinaryActions/CHDN_NQ_2015.pd
market manipulation of 4 US based small cap companies.


In the 1990’s, Richard Propper resigned as the managing general partner at Montgomery Medical
Ventures, a venture-capital �rm controlled by Montgomery Securities, amid reports that he inadvertently
disclosed to a family member inside information (http://4closurefraud.org/2010/07/27/did-david-j-stern-
djsp-disclose-that-13-owner-kerry-s-propper-was-the-subject-of-doj-investigation-and-sba-law-
suit/) about a Montgomery-related transaction (SEC investigation).


A few years later, he settled with the SEC (http://4closurefraud.org/2010/07/27/did-david-j-stern-djsp-
disclose-that-13-owner-kerry-s-propper-was-the-subject-of-doj-investigation-and-sba-law-suit/) over
allegations that, as a general partner of two Montgomery funds, he failed to disclose holdings and
transactions (http://4closurefraud.org/2010/07/27/did-david-j-stern-djsp-disclose-that-13-owner-kerry-s-
propper-was-the-subject-of-doj-investigation-and-sba-law-suit/)in several public companies.


In 2005 and 2007, both Proppers were sued for defrauding the Small Business Association
(http://observer.com/2010/08/the-right-and-honorable-kerry-propper/) (“SBA”) out of $35 million.


It was at about this time that the Proppers and their Chardan Capital discovered the gold mine that
was Chinese reverse mergers and SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Cos).


The implosion of Chinese reverse merger frauds is where Chardan became truly egregious. But this is
where the �rm also ended up making a fortune.


GeoInvesting (AKA The GeoTeam), highlighted no less than 17 di�erent examples
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/299068-17-reasons-not-to-take-chardans-wavering-opinion-on-
zhongpin-seriously) of Chardan Chinese reverse mergers / SPACs, the majority of which completely
imploded following exposure of or allegations of fraud.


To highlight just a few examples:


Chardan formed the SPAC that housed Chinese A Power, which was then halted and delisted. It no
longer trades.


Chardan formed the SPAC which also housed CABL, which voluntarily delisted from the NASDAQ.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 30/43


Chardan was also involved in the $30 million capital raise for Liwa International (NASDAQ:LIWA
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LIWA)) which imploded due to exposed fraud.


Chardan received substantial negative attention for an imploded fraud called Huiheng Medical, which
was supposedly involved in treating brain cancer.


This attention went mainstream against Chardan and the Proppers in a USA Today article
(http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/markets/story/2011-12-26/china-us-merger-cautionary-
tale/52233828/1).


The USA today article details obvious and egregious supposed “oversights” by Chardan and the
Proppers. A reporter who traveled to China revealed that Huiheng was in fact just an empty building
with a tiny parking lot and little activity going on.


The USA today article also details numerous additional imploded frauds where Chardan and the
Proppers were involved, making millions as investors lost everything.


Eventually it became clear that the market was no longer dumb enough to buy Chinese reverse merger
frauds. But the Proppers still had an unused empty shell company which they wanted to monetize.


The empty shell had originally been intended for another China target and was (at the time) aptly
named “Chardan 2008 China Acquisition Corp“.


By 2010, Chinese reverse mergers were imploding in a wave of outright frauds and Chardan and
the Proppers were already getting heat for it. Anything with “China” in the name was toxic and no longer
marketable to naïve investors. But Chardan and the Proppers had clearly spent millions of dollars
setting up this empty shell acquisition company.


Rather than let it go to waste, Chardan simply changed the name and purpose of the shell and had
it buy a US based law which specialized in processing mortgage foreclosures. Such foreclosures were
booming in the wake of the 2008/2009 �nancial crisis in the US.


Once again, Chardan and the Proppers were the subject of widespread unwanted attention. The New
York Times featured an article entitled, “Bet on Foreclosure Boom Turns Sour for Investors
(http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/business/02stern.html?_r=0)“.


As with the USA Today article, the NY Times details the lengthy history of regulatory violations from
Proppers.


Here is the summary:


Chardan had its defunct “China” SPAC purchase the US based law �rm of David J. Stern, which
focused on processing housing foreclosures. As a result, the private company then became publicly
tradable and was named “DJSP Enterprises”


Aside from making millions in fees, as the owner of the SPAC, Chardan retained a signi�cant amount of
ownership in the newly public company, receiving millions of shares for just pennies a piece. And then
Dr. Propper was paid additional fees to act as a “consultant” to the company.


Shares of the company quickly soared to as high as $14 and Mr. Stern ended up cashing out a
whopping $60 million.


But then the Florida Attorney General’s O�ice began investigating DSJP for falsifying documents to
speed up foreclosures. The �rm quickly lost its biggest clients. Its executives quit and the �rm quickly
�red 80% of its sta�. In addition to the issues with regulators, the �rm faced new lawsuits from both
investors and employees.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 31/43


DJSP now trades for just 13 cents.


Even with a US target, it turns out that Chardan’s renamed China SPAC ended up no better o� than the
previous generations of reverse merger frauds pursued in China.


The typical Chardan deal is heavily followed by retail investors who simply buy into the hype of a sexy
story and a few bullish press releases. But when Chardan helps these companies raise money, it does
need to get institutions to pony up a millions of dollars at a time.


QUESTION: If Chardan’s history of regulatory violations and stock implosions is so widely
documented and well known, then how have they gotten new investors to buy into their deals ?


ANSWER: Give away FREE MONEY !


Here is how the technique works.


First, give some “friendly” investors a heads up that a company needs to raise money.


Second, those companies get SHORT the shares of the subject company, in advance of the �nancing
deal.


Third, one or more banks announces that the company wishes to raise money at a discount. The share
price falls.


Fourth, the “friendly” investor then buys the new shares at a considerable discount, covering its short
position at a nice pro�t.


This is a great trade for all of the inside players involved. Everybody wins.


The bank involved makes a fat fee for running the o�ering.


The “friendly” investor makes a tidy pro�t with literally zero risk.


The company raises a few million dollars and then puts out a press release which leads smaller
(naïve) investors to believe that some institution has enough con�dence in the company to commit
millions in capital to it.


The only ones who get suckered are the retail investors. Because in reality, this investor merely
covered their short position and in no way wants to commit any capital whatsoever to this company or
this deal. They know it is likely going down, not up.


No, this is not a hypothetical. And no, I am not making this up.


Here are the SEC charges (http://www.secactions.com/sec-charges-trader-with-insider-trading-
manipulative-short-selling/) which describe that exact sequence of events when Chardan was helping
AutoChina raise money. Investor Charles Langston, who controlled CRL Management, LLC and
Guarantee Reinsurance, LTD, got the heads up from Chardan and quickly began selling shares at
$41.75. That very same afternoon, the deal was announced and Langston was able to cover his short
at $35, making a near instant and riskless 17% pro�t.


Chardan’s defense to this is that it had sent Mr. Langston a “con�dentiality” agreement and told him not
to trade on it.


However, we can see from the SEC case that this was actually the 4th time that Mr. Langston has
performed the exact same trade. Each time, he would short in advance and cover on the deal.


It becomes quite clear why someone like Mr. Langston would not want to hold Chardan’s AutoChina.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 32/43


Chardan’s AutoChina was subsequently exposed as a complete fraud
(http://www.reuters.com/article/sec-autochina-idUSL2E8FB75S20120411) and imploded to zero.


By now, the mechanics of the fraud should start to sound familiar. This includes the use of o�shore
brokers and undisclosed holdings. The parties would make fraudulent trades between their own
accounts (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2014/lr23033.htm) to generate the appearance
of legitimate trading volume and interest in the stock.


For those who wish to read more about Chardan implosions, here is a very partial list. Note that these
are all recent deals on US listed small caps.


Northwest Bio


Chardan recently announced (http://www.nwbio.com/nw-bio-announces-a-registered-direct-o�ering-of-
3-7-million-with-new-institutional-investors/) that it would be helping Northwest Bio raise a few million
dollars. I had previously exposed a well orchestrated pump on Northwest Bio entitled:


Behind The Promotion Of Northwest Bio (http://seekingalpha.com/article/2301825-behind-the-
promotion-of-northwest-bio)


This promotion had driven the worthless stock up to $7.50. Like the others, it was supposedly a
promising biotech with a new treatment for cancer. (sound familiar?) The stock has since imploded to
just 43 cents.


Live Deal / Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LIVE))


Another orchestrated stock promotion sent shares of microcap LiveDeal (now known as Live Ventures)
up by 500%. As with the others, there was virtually no revenue and no business activity.


The promotion was exposed by Bleecker Street Research (http://seekingalpha.com/article/1973861-
livedeal-50-percent-downside-possible-in-this-promoted-stock), which also detailed Chardan’s
involvement in helping the company raise money at around $9.00 per share. The stock has since
imploded by 80%.


Spherix (NASDAQ:SPEX (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/SPEX))


Chardan also helped (http://�nance.yahoo.com/news/spherix-announces-registered-direct-common-
131500726.html) troubled Spherix raise millions of dollars. Spherix has since imploded by 90%, with the
entire company now worth just $4 million.


22nd Century Group (NYSEMKT:XXII (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/XXII))


XXII was exposed (http://seekingalpha.com/article/2454105-22nd-century-group-a-lot-of-smoke-not-
enough-�re) by the GeoTeam as a stock promotion, which included details of insider’s past involvement
in stock manipulation and excessive compensation of insiders bleeding the company dry.


Geo details Chardan’s lengthy history in �nancing the company, including the fact that it has received
shares in XXII as compensation. Chardan had been aggressively touting the company, releasing
a research report
(http://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Chardan+Capital+Bullishness+on+22nd+Century+%28XX
a $9.00 target.


XXII has since imploded to just $1.00.


So again, Nymox recently �led a prospectus using Chardan as its banker and Zouvas as its
lawyer. Nymox is again looking to sell millions of shares, following its hyper bullish (but
unsubstantiated) press releases.

You do the math. This history of these parties should speak for themselves in terms of where
the share price is headed.


In my experienced opinion, it quickly plunges to true zero. (Just like past Zouvas / Chardan
deals)


Behind the purchases of James Robinson


In July 2015, right after Nymox re-domiciled to the Bahamas, Nymox appointed
(https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/07/30/756443/0/en/Nymox-Announces-Appointment-of-
James-G-Robinson-to-Board-of-Directors.html)James G. Robinson
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_G._Robinson) to the board of directors.


James Robinson is a big time Hollywood �lm producer He is the CEO and co-founder of Morgan Creek
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morgan_Creek_Productions) productions, which has produced dozens of
well known hit movies, including the Ace Ventura Series, Young Guns, The Last of the Mohicans, Robin
Hood: Prince of Thieves, The Major League series, Get Carter, Heist, and many others.


Robinson is now 81 years old and his net worth has been estimated at over half a billion dollars.


But please keep in mind that he has never shown any experience in biotech or in investing in small cap
stocks.


In the initial press release (https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/07/30/756443/0/en/Nymox-
Announces-Appointment-of-James-G-Robinson-to-Board-of-Directors.html), Nymox announced that:


Jim has been a long-term supporter of the Company in the past and this is great news for our
shareholders


It is unclear what Nymox meant by “long-term supporter”. But in any event, we can see that
Robinsons �rst SEC �ling (http://www.secinfo.com/d1yd4b.me.htm) disclosing ownership of Nymox did
not occur until 2 weeks AFTER that press release.


A that time, Robinson disclosed owning 2.1 million shares of Nymox.


Since that time, the 81 year old �lm director has continued to acquire small amounts of stock every few
weeks or months. This is never more than a few thousand shares at a time, amounting to typically
$10,000 or $20,000.


Yet each time he makes another small purchase, the news wires �ag another “insider purchase by a
director”. This (along with the bullish press releases from Nymox) is enough to lure in a few more retail
investors and helps to keep the stock a�oat.


I have already demonstrated above that so far EVERYONE with any involvement in Nymox has a
lengthy history of imploded stock promotions, regulatory violations and / or outright fraud. This includes
management at Nymox, their auditor, their legal counsel and their banker.


So far, I don’t believe that this is the case with Robinson. He has far too much money and far too big of
a reputation to be caught up in a penny stock promotion to make just a few million dollars.


The reality is that I don’t know what attracted the 81 year old �lm producer to Nymox in the �rst place.
But again, Robinson has never demonstrated any expertise with biotech or with small cap
stocks.


What I do know is that I have seen this exact “movie” before and it always ends badly.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 34/43


Robinson will lose a few million dollars on his investment in Nymox. He can certainly a�ord this
small loss. In fact, with such a substantial net worth, I have no doubt that this will just be a tax
write o� at the end of the year against various other capital gains he may have. The �nancial
impact of this will not be a big deal for Robinson.


A much bigger deal will be the damage to his reputation when his involvement hits the �nancial
press and the Hollywood tabloids, which I am quite certain it will.


Here is what you need to know about the purchases by Robinson:


Recruiting a prestigious outsider is a standard play out of the penny stock promotion handbook I have
seen it many times before and I will (of course) provide multiple examples.


In order to gain some credibility with retail investors, penny stock promotions try very hard to lure in any
outside investor, manager or director who has some combination of wealth, fame or status.


As a board member, they frequently attract older retired executives who simply want to stay relevant
and be “in the game” rather than being perceived by their peers as having been “put out to pasture”.


Despite the hype surrounding their appointments, these board members are not really required to know
much about the underlying company and their involvement is limited to typically 8-10 days per year.


Again, I have seen this same phenomenon over and over again where wealthy, older executives are
lured into a small cap stock promotion. They then lose their investment and their reputations when the
promotion implodes.


There are many examples. I will start with four that come to the top of my mind.


Example #1 – DS Healthcare (NASDAQ:DSKX (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/DSKX)) and
Manny Gonzalez of Proctor & Gamble


In 2015, a tiny microcap called DS Healthcare had minimal revenues, going concern warnings from a
dubious auditor and multiple weaknesses in internal controls. The company was a blatant stock
promotion with obvious problems and a market cap of around $50 million.


DS Healthcare was supposedly a “consumer products” company marketing personal care products.


In April 2015, the company managed to recruit 72 year old Manny Gonzalezas its Chief Commercial
O�icer. In the press release (https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2015/08/14/760804/0/en/Procter-
Gamble-Global-Vice-President-of-Sales-Joins-DS-Healthcare.html), DS Healthcare noted that:


In his role at Procter & Gamble, Mr. Gonzalez was responsible for managing an organization
with $30 billion in revenue including the entire North American merchandiser sales force of over
3,000 sales representatives for all Procter & Gamble product categories, including the
company’s extensive personal care products portfolio….. In addition to his 23 years of
experience at Procter & Gamble, Mr. Gonzalez is the current Chairman of Center for
Leadership, Florida International University (2013-current). He has served as Chairman of the
Board Services Committee for Zoological Society of Florida, Board of Directors of Procter &
Gamble Good Government Fund (GGF-PAC), and Vice-Chairman of Industry Trade Advisory
Committee for Consumer Goods (ITAC 4) at U.S. Department of Commerce and ITA.


There is no doubt that Gonzalez is an experienced industry veteran in consumer products and a major
big shot. This was tremendous news and appeared to completely validate the tiny microcap company.


Not surprisingly, the stock quickly doubled on the news.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 35/43


Yet not long after his appointment, a scathing report (http://seekingalpha.com/article/3443766-ds-
healthcare-look-60minus-70-percent-drop-equity-o�ering-accounting-problems-solvency) from Bleecker
Street Research highlighted deep problems at this transparent stock promotion, including:


– The company had virtually no revenues and was out of cash


– The stock had soared on a series of misleading press releases


– A going concern warning and a dicey auditor


– Ine�ective internal controls


– Past due SEC �lings (including 10K and 10Q)


– Management almost entirely run by one individual, founder and CEO Daniel Khesin


– Opaque �nancing and consulting deals with recently incorporated entities


In other words, DS Healthcare sounded almost exactly like Nymox.


Not surprisingly, the disturbing revelations from Bleecker resulted in an immediate plunge in the share
price of DS Healthcare. It quickly ended up plunging by more than 50%, and by now it has fallen by
around 80% from its pre Bleecker levels. DS now trades for around 60 cents, but there is so little
volume that it is nearly impossible for anyone (including Gonzalez) to sell much stock.


As with the involvement of Robinson in Nymox, it is unclear how an experienced industry veteran could
be lured into such a dubious stock promotion. But as we will continue to see, this does happen all the
time.


Example #2 – Chromadex (NASDAQ:CDXC (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDXC)) and


In June of 2016, microcap Chromadex Corp announced the appointment of 77 year old William D.
Smithburg to its board of directors. Chromdex is purportedly in the “supplements” business and
Smithburg had previously been Chairman of Quaker Oats, following a multi decade career there.


According to the glowing press release (https://globenewswire.com/news-
release/2016/06/07/846580/0/en/ChromaDex-Names-Former-Chairman-CEO-of-The-Quaker-Oats-
Company-William-Smithburg-to-its-Board-of-Directors.html) from Chromadex:


The 77 year old Smithburg had previously been President and CEO of Quaker Oats, as well as serving
on the board of directors for several well known publicly listed US giants including: Abbott Labs,
Northern Trust and Corning, among others.


In addition, it was noted that Smithburg had disclosed owning 640,000 shares of Chromadex, all made
in open market purchases. These were valued at nearly $4 million at the time.


Once again, an exposé report from Bleecker street revealed the existence of signi�cant issues at
Chromadex. The report was nearly 40 pages long. I printed a hard copy.


Bleecker had stated that:


Just weeks earlier, a key backer of Chromadex had just been publicly named
speci�cally in a SEC plea agreement for another imploded fraud
Just a few weeks earlier, a key Chromadex director had just been indicted in
a massive securities fraud case, but Chromadex had swept the news under
the rug
Past Chromadex key investors had gone to jail for fraud, including for dumping
undisclosed share holdings

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 36/43


Chromadex backers had a long history of involvement in similar microcaps
which ended up imploding to the pennies.


Following the Bleecker report, the share price quickly plunged by as much as 50% on that single day.


And again, director candidates are typically expected to put in no more than 8-10 days per year in their
companies, such that it is unlikely that the veteran Mr. Smithburg had any idea about the concerning
allegations about Chromadex.


The 77 year old Mr. Smithburg quickly recognized that he was in over his head. He wanted nothing to
do with such controversy.


Literally on the same day as the article was published, Mr. Smithburg resigned
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1b6Mu.w65w.htm#1stPage)from the board of Chromadex.


The point (so far) is this: Despite the fact that he was an experienced industry veteran and had
substantial board experience with very legitimate large cap stocks, Mr. Smithburg had no idea what he
was getting into when he entered the world of heavily promoted microcaps. He made a very smart
move by simply resigning as soon as even the hint of fraud and the involvement of fraudsters appeared.


And then it gets even more interesting.


About a week after the article was published, Bleecker took the unusual step of removing the article
from publication. I am still unclear as to what behind-the-scenes events led to this outcome.


In fact, this simply strengthens the case the Mr. Smithburg was simply not well informed at all about
Chromadex.


Had Mr. Smithburg known of problems at Chromadex, he would never have joined the board. And yet
had he known about some perceived problems in the Bleecker article he would seemingly not have
resigned.


The point is simply that the 77 year old Mr. Smithburg was appointed to the board and invested millions
of dollars into the stock without really having enough information at all. He was ill informed when he
joined the company and he was arguably ill informed when he resigned.


Because he had so little information, resigning is certainly the smartest move for him to make.


Example #3 – China Biotics (formerly CHBT) and Richard Azar


Back in 2011, I was intimately involved in exposing a Chinese reverse merger fraud at China Biotics. I
had been living in China and I had been able to gain access to the company’s factories, proving that
there were no operations and virtually no employees. It was an egregious empty shell fraud.


I was not alone in my fraud conclusions. There were at least a dozen other reports from well known
short sellers providing truly conclusive evidence that China Biotics had no operations and was a total
fraud. Yet the market cap still hovered at around $200 million.


At the time, Chinese reverse mergers were imploding due to fraud on a weekly basis. Literally hundreds
of these former high�iers went straight to zero when their auditors resigned after �nding fraud.


China Biotics was due to be audited in just a few weeks, when a little known investor named Richard
Azar suddenly disclosed taking a massive 20% stake (http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/499191-stark-
baddiin/181773-chbts-richard-azar-is-potentially-settting-up-one-massive-short-squeeze) in the
company, nearly $40 million worth of stock. Azar had been described as an accomplished investor who

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 37/43


had taken large positions in other related industries. His net worth had been estimated in the hundreds
of millions of dollars. Notably, he had never demonstrated any experience in Chinese micro cap
investing.


According to this article (http://www.articlesbase.com/investing-articles/great-caribbean-investors-
1268639.html):


Azar has been actively investing since he was 17. His father loaned him $100,000 at the time,
and Azar paid his father back two years later by buying Berkshire and making currency trades.
Azar retains a signi�cant stake in Berkshire stock today.


Educated in Canada and the U.S., Azar was turned down at Harvard Business School, but said
it was a blessing in disguise, as he used those years for intensive study of books about Bu�ett
and value investing and continued business success.


He kept right on piling up stunning returns, vaulting him into the top ranks of businessmen in
Trinidad. If Azar lived in America, he would be one of the wealthiest Americans for his age and
could be in Fortune’s list of the 40 wealthiest people under 40.


As a result of the huge investment from Azar (which was shown in public SEC �lings), China Biotics
quickly surged by as much as 40%. After all, a sophisticated international investor like this wouldn’t take
such a massive positon in such a controversial stock unless he “knew something” through deep due
diligence.


As with the Nymox purchases by Robinson, Mr. Azar’s purchases were revealed in a string of
continued SEC �lings (http://www.secinfo.com/d141Nx.q1Z3p.htm#1stPage) where various amounts
continued to be purchased over time at various prices.


Retail investors also piled into the stock, trying to ride on the coattails of Mr. Azar.


Yet the fraud allegations against China Biotics were very public. Anyone using Google could see
numerous articles and allegations.


And then just few weeks after the purchases by Mr. Azar, it was announced that China Biotics auditor
had resigned (http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.q1582.d.htm) due to egregious �ndings of outright fraud
and that it would then simply voluntarily deslist its stock to the pink sheets. China Biotics no longer
trades.


Subsequent SEC �lings (http://www.secinfo.com/d12TC3.p1Yaf.htm#1stPage) revealed that Mr. Azar
continued to own over 4 million shares of China Biotics. His $40 million investment simply went to zero.


Example #4 – China Medical Technologies (formerly CMED) and Peter Deutsche


Like China Biotics, China Medical Technologies was a fraud. And just like China Biotics, China Medical
managed to lure in an international “high net worth” investor who would quickly lose tens of millions of
dollars.


At one time, device maker China Medical Technologies was trading at around $4-5. It was publicly
exposed in a fraud report by Glaucus research. The stock plunged. The company then defaulted on its
debt and its auditor resigned. The stock was truly worthless and quickly plunged to below $1.00.


At this time, despite the obvious terminal situation, a wealthy New York wine merchant by the name of
Peter Deutsche began buying massive amounts of China Med stock. Literally tens of millions of dollars.

7/5/2019 Short NYMX. This offshore “biotech” promotion will go to zero (yes, zero) - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 38/43


Like Robinson at Nymox, the Deutsche family was extremely successful in a certain industry, namely
importing wine. They created a wine empire worth hundreds of millions of dollars.


But (like Robinson at Nymox), they clearly had no expertise in microcap stocks or speci�cally with
medical devices.


Again, China Medical had been exposed as a fraud, its auditor had resigned and the company had
defaulted on debts worth hundreds of millions. Yet retail investors chose to ignore all of these data
points and focus on a single data point: that a wealthy New York wine merchant was buying the stock.


After all, such a “high net worth” investor who had been such a success elsewhere wouldn’t dive in and
make such a huge investment without an information advantage.


The huge purchases by Mr. Deutsche attracted plenty of attention from retail traders and the stock price
quickly soared by 200-300%.


Finally, the SEC stepped in and halted the stock. When it resumed trading, it immediately plunged. It
has since been entirely delisted and no longer trades. The Deutsches lost e�ectively their entire
investment, as did the retail punters who went along for the ride.


The Deutsches have since blamed their broker, Fidelity, for the tens of millions in losses and are now
involved in a lengthy and detailed (and very embarrassingly public) court battle.


Unfortunately for the Deutsches, the whole story has been publicly aired by Bloomberg
(http://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-04-20/the-wine-mogul-vs-�delity) and other media
outlets in excruciating detail.


Behind the purchases of James Robinson


Here is how I see it:


In each of the examples above, we should be reminded of the old saying by poker players:


Whenever you walk up to the poker table, you should always try to spot the sucker. If you can’t
spot the sucker, chances are….it’s YOU.


In each case, the individuals above were smart and wealthy. They were also very experienced in their
own respective industries. But when they sat down to play the new game, they were the sucker and
they were quickly taken by those with experience.


With Nymox, e�ectively, a few seasoned players sat down for a friendly game of poker. But they game
wasn’t “Texas hold ’em”, it was “microcap stock promotion”.


For a time, the key players were as follows:


Nymox CEO, Paul Averback – Experienced stock promoter who reaped tens of millions from a
company which is out of cash and which has failed to sell products for 30 years.


Auditor, Thayer O’Neal – Penny stock “auditor” who was formed by simply renaming itself as a spino�
from LL Bradford which had been shut down by the PCAOB. Very experienced with the books of tiny
reverse mergers, which have imploded to just pennies.


Legal Counsel, Luke Zouvas – Experienced attorney for dozens of imploded micro cap stock
promotions, which also imploded to the pennies. Recently charged by the SEC with securities
fraud for an imploded penny stock promotion fraud. SCROLL

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 39/43


Banker, Chardan Captial / Propper family – Experienced fund raisers for numerous imploded penny
stock promotions, including imploded Chinese reverse merger frauds. Decades long history
of securities law violations and fraud run ins.


And then….


And then at some point, up to this poker game walks an extremely wealthy 81 year old �lm producer.
Unlike the others, the �lm producer has ZERO EXPERIENCE in biotech or small cap stocks.


The four experienced players are thrilled (absolutely THRILLED) to welcome the wealthy 81 year old
�lm producer (and his money) to the poker game. Not only is he putting millions of his own money into
the stock, but the attention is attracting small retail investors who also put money into the stock. Nymox
share price (and VOLUME) rises accordingly.


Again, attracting wealthy and successful “board members” is a standard play out of the stock promotion
hand book. It happens all the time. Despite the hype from the press releases and the monetary
investments, these individuals often know far too little about the companies they are getting involved
with. Even though their investments appear large, they are in fact small relative to their total net worth.
The time commitment of a board member is often just a few days a year, such that it does not justify
doing a “forensic level” of research on the company or its partners.


Not only do such individuals quickly lose millions of dollars, but they also endure very public
embarrassment, especially due to the association with people who have ties to fraud.


Conclusion


In the past, I have written about many biotech stocks which were highly problematic, but I refrain from
predicting that they will go to “zero”. Many of these biotechs quickly imploded by 80% or more. Nymox
is even worse, because it is truly a zero and is likely to go there quite fast.


Nymox is an o�shore stock promotion with reported institutional interest of just 1% and no research
coverage. Yet the history of using a pre-constructed anonymous Panamanian o�shore �nancing vehicle
to issue piles of unregistered stock makes me believe that there are undisclosed pockets of o�shore
ownership. In the case of Force�eld Energy, this is what ultimately caused the stock to implode to the
pennies (99%) within just a few trading days of my article exposing it. The people who held the stock
o�shore knew without question that it was a fraud and a zero. As a result, they continued to dump
millions of shares even when the stock was below 50 cents.


Nymox clearly had in its possession the full data that NX-1207 had failed Phase 3 clinical trials, yet it
continued for 6-12 months to put out bullish press releases while management continued to secretly
dump millions worth of stock without making timely SEC disclosures.


After the implosion, Nymox re-domiciled to the Bahamas and restarted the promotion with a new string
of misleading press releases. The stock price has subsequently soared by as much as 10x.


The press releases are easily debunked and the doctor behind the most recent press release did not
disclose direct funding from Nymox or ownership of shares.


Following 30 years of various failures, Nymox is now down to just $800,000 of cash and continues to
generate no material revenues. The company has a “going concern” warning and its internal controls
have been deemed ine�ective for over 2 years now.


Nymox’s legal counsel was just charged by the SEC for securities fraud and has a long history with
imploded penny stock promotions, very similar to Nymox. At one time, these stocks (like Nymox) had
soared on promotion, they now trade for just pennies.

https://moxreports.com/nymox-nymx-this-offshore-biotech-promotion-will-go-to-zero-yes-zero/ 40/43


Nymox’s auditor Thayer O’Neal is simply a renamed “spin o�” from LL Bradford which was shut down
by the PCAOB for gross audit de�ciencies. Thayer has since just picked up all of the old LL Bradford
clients, which happen to also be imploded penny stock promotions that trade for just a few cents.


Nymox’s banker has a decades long history of run ins with regulators for stock manipulation as well as
a very visible history of �nancing fraudulent companies which quickly go to zero.


Recent share purchases by James Robinson have boosted the share price and attracted small retail
investors into the stock.


Mr. Robinson is an 81 year old �lm director who is based in California. He is very wealthy but has no
experience in biotech or small cap stocks. Nymox is based in the Bahamas.


Targeting such individuals by o�ering easy board appointments is a truly standard tactic of many stock
promotions which I have exposed in the past. These board positions typically require just a few days
per year and do not involve in depth background research by the new board member.
