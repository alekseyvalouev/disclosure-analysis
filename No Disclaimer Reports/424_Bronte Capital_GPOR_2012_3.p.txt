Gulfport Energy and Wexford Capital: Part 3
Gulfport Energy - as I have shown in Part 1 and Part 2 - is intertwined with Connecticut based hedge
fund group Wexford Capital. All their substantial assets are either jointly owned or operated or both by
Wexford entities. The Chairman of the board of Gulfport is - at least in part - a Wexford man. 
 
However Wexford have over the past few years dramatically reduced their holding in Gulfport. In the
30 April 2009 proxy Charles E Davidson (the principal of Wexford) spoke for 15,235,786 shares or
just over 35 percent of the company. 
 
After years of sustained selling by Wexford and sustained issuance by Gulfport, Wexford's ownership
position is about two thirds lower. 
 
Despite Wexford's reduced holding Gulfport remains tied to Wexford. 
 
Wexford and Gulfport are still doing related party transactions. On 7 May (ie this month) they
announced a transaction whereby they are selling their Permian assets in exchange for a stake in a
soon-to-be-listed entity called Diamond Back. 
 
There was no specific press release for this transaction - but it was announced via a long 8K. On May
8 they announced their quarterly results which briefly described this transaction. To quote the
earnings release: 
 
 


As previously announced, on May 7, 2012, Gulfport entered into a contribution
agreement with Diamondback Energy, Inc. ("Diamondback Energy"), in which Gulfport
agreed to contribute, prior to the closing of Diamondback Energy's initial public offering,
all of Gulfport's oil and natural gas interests in the Permian Basin in exchange for (i)
common stock representing 35% of Diamondback Energy's outstanding common stock
immediately prior to the closing of its initial public offering and (ii) approximately $63.6
million to be paid to Gulfport upon closing of such offering, subject to adjustment.
Gulfport's obligation to complete the proposed contribution is subject to various closing
conditions, including Gulfport's satisfaction with the terms of the Diamondback offering.


 
The earnings release however does not include the observation that this is a related party transaction.
You had to go to the 8K for that. Here is what the 8K says:


 
On May 7, 2012, Gulfport Energy Corporation (“Gulfport”) entered into a Contribution
Agreement (the “Contribution Agreement”) with Diamondback Energy, Inc.
(“Diamondback”). Diamondback was incorporated on December 30, 2011 for purposes
of undertaking an initial public offering (“Diamondback IPO”) of its common stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the “Common Stock”), pursuant to a Registration Statement on
Form S-1 (Registration No. 333-179502) initially filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on February 13, 2012. Diamondback has not conducted and will not
conduct any material operations prior to the transactions described below. Prior to the
completion of the Diamondback IPO, Diamondback will acquire all the outstanding
equity interests in Windsor Permian LLC (“Windsor Permian”), which as of March 31,
2012, owned and operated approximately 30,025 net acres of oil and gas interests in
the Permian Basin in West Texas. 


Under the terms of the Contribution Agreement, Gulfport agreed to contribute to
Diamondback, prior to the closing of the Diamondback IPO, all of its oil and gas
interests in the Permian Basin in exchange for (i) shares of Common Stock representing
35% of Diamondback’s outstanding Common Stock immediately prior to the closing of
the Diamondback IPO and (ii) $63,590,050.00 in the form of a non-interest bearing
promissory note, which will be repaid in full upon the closing of the Diamondback IPO

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Gulfport Energy and Wexford Capital: Part 3


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/05/gulfport-energy-and-wexford-capital_22.html 2/7


with a portion of the net proceeds from that offering. The aggregate consideration
payable to Gulfport is subject to a post-closing cash adjustment based on changes in
Windsor Permian’s working capital, long-term debt and other items referred to in the
Contribution Agreement as of the date of the contribution. Windsor Permian is the
operator of the acreage to be contributed by Gulfport. Gulfport’s obligation to make this
contribution is contingent upon, among other things, the contribution to Diamondback of
all the outstanding equity interests in Windsor Permian by DB Energy Holdings LLC
(“DB Holdings”), Gulfport’s satisfaction with the terms of the Diamondback IPO and
customary closing conditions. Under the contribution agreement, Gulfport is generally
responsible for all liabilities and obligations with respect to the contributed properties
arising prior to the contribution and Diamondback is responsible for such liabilities and
obligations arising after the contribution. 


In connection with the contribution, Gulfport and Diamondback will enter into an Investor
Rights Agreement in which Gulfport will have the right, for so long as Gulfport
beneficially owns more than 10% of Diamondback’s outstanding Common Stock, to
designate one individual as a nominee to serve on Diamondback’s board of directors.
Such nominee, if elected to Diamondback’s board, will also serve on each committee of
the board so long as he or she satisfies the independence and other requirements for
service on the applicable committee of the board. So long as Gulfport has the right to
designate a nominee to Diamondback’s board and there is no Gulfport nominee actually
serving as a Diamondback director, Gulfport shall have the right to appoint one
individual as an advisor to the board who shall be entitled to attend board and
committee meetings. Gulfport will also be entitled to certain information rights and
Diamondback will grant Gulfport certain demand and “piggyback” registration rights
obligating Diamondback to register with the SEC any shares of Common Stock owned
by Gulfport. 


The preceding descriptions of the Contribution Agreement and the Investor Rights
Agreement are qualified in their entirety by reference to the full text of such agreements,
copies of which are attached as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively, to this Current
Report on Form 8-K and are incorporated herein by reference. 


Diamondback, Windsor Permian and DB Holdings are entities controlled by Wexford
Capital LP (“Wexford”). Charles E. Davidson, the Chairman and Chief Investment
Officer of Wexford, beneficially owned approximately 9.5% of Gulfport’s outstanding
common stock as of March 13, 2012. Mike Liddell, Gulfport’s Chairman of the Board
and a director of Gulfport, currently serves as the operating member and chairman of
Windsor Permian and has an interest in DB Holdings. A special committee of the Board
of Directors consisting solely of independent directors negotiated and approved this
transaction on behalf of Gulfport.


 
 
The related party nature of this transaction requires (and is being granted) a committee of the
independent directors. 
 
 
How important are the Permian assets?
 
The last annual report (10K) contained a table with Gulfport's proved reserves by field:

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Gulfport Energy and Wexford Capital: Part 3


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/05/gulfport-energy-and-wexford-capital_22.html 3/7

In their defence - after the transaction they own 35 percent of the related party which is lower but not
massively lower than their prior ownership of the field. All that has happened is that they have lost
control of the assets which they directly owned and are now owned by a Wexford entity. In this I
presume the Wexford interests in those assets were also contributed and on similar terms. [I do not
know - I am just giving Wexford the benefit of my doubt...]
 
Whatever: losing control means that they also lose control of the cash flows from these assets.
Moreover as they own less than 80 percent of the assets if they get these cash flows out there will be
a tax event. The 8K quoted above envisages a sell-down of the assets. This transaction does not
make sense from a tax perspective unless that sell-down happens. So I presume a sell-down is
expected.
 
As a shareholder it seems you are swapping productive assets you know for some cash which will
(presumably) be used to develop other assets. Some of that cash only arrives when the IPO of
Diamondback happens. There is nothing obviously wrong with that - but the related-party nature of
the transaction does raise governance risks which make shareholders dependent on the non-
executive directors to guard their interests.
