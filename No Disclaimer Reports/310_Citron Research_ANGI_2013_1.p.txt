Introduction: AKG is Highly Likely to End Up a Zero 
 
We are short Asanko Gold Inc. (“AKG”) because it is highly likely to end up a Zero.  Flawed 
geology led to investments in Nkran, Esaase, and various satellite deposits that in our view are 
unrecoverable.  We see the company as trying to stave off the inevitable, and unsustainably 
mining Nkran in a desperate search for cash flow.  The company is looking to Nkran’s satellite 
deposits to bridge the gap, but we see little chance that the satellite deposits save the company.  
We expect AKG to run out of cash in 2018 while trying to service $165 million of debt.  The 
best-case medium-term scenario seems to be an extremely dilutive equity raise, possibly 
approximating half of AKG’s market cap.  The worst case scenario – and not a remote one in our 
view – is bankruptcy.  Regardless, we think that eventually AKG is highly likely to become a 
Zero. 
 
Nkran could be on the verge of two discrete, but related, calamities: Major wall collapse or 
“pinching out”.  Significant portions of Nkran have already collapsed.  There has been a failure 
in the west wall that management has described as “little” and “tiny”.1  However, satellite and 
drone imagery shows the wall failure and impact on the ramp is likely quite serious.  The 
collapse is approximately 250 meters long, and has caused an approximately 175 meter to 200-
meter section of the ramp to begin sliding into the pit.  The same imagery shows there are mine 
wall failures in almost every direction, making it quite possible that additional major failures of 
the mine’s upper and mid-levels are just a matter of time.  Over the next five months, Ghana will 
go through its two rainy seasons (May – July and August – October).2  Even without a collapse, 
AKG will highly likely need a significant pushback of the west or east wall to continue accessing 
ore from the pit through 2018.  We estimate that a pushback that allows AKG to access new ore 
bodies would cost $75 to $115 million.   
 
Nkran might be about to “pinch out”, in which case its remaining LoM could be less than six 
months, or just 25% of the original plan.  “Pinching out” is when the costs of additional mining 
exceed its expected revenue – i.e., it is not profitable to mine further.  If Nkran pinches out, we 
do not see how AKG could fund Esaase or any other development that might move the cash flow 
needle.  AKG has found significantly less gold in Nkran than expected.  The original plan called 
for it to “slow-mine” Nkran,3 which would have entailed regular wall pushbacks to make the 
wall slopes more gradual.  After the initial mining turned out to yield less gold, AKG responded 
by aggressively mining into the “guts” of the ore body.4  In doing so, it abandoned plans for 
ongoing wall pushbacks.  Nkran has now been mined into a steep “V” shape.  The lowest level of

2 The Kumasi region of Ghana where Nkran and its other deposits are primarily located is characterized as hilly 
terrain dissected by broad, flat drainages that typically form swamps in the wet season. It is in a Wet Evergreen 
Forest Zone and has two monsoon seasons.  The first run from May through July and the second from August to 
October.  Additional heavy rains can also sporadically occur before or after these periods.  For more information see 
AKG 2016 Annual Information, p. 44. Also, Ghana Rain Watch: 
http://www.meteo.gov.gh/website/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=5&Itemid=85 
3 This is evident from the original 2015 Mine Plan (presented numerous times, e.g. 2015-02-20 BMO Conference 
Presentation, p.5) wherein Nkran is depicted as delivering “consistent annual operating volumes” of ore from 2015-
2027, with 20-25 million tons of ore being extracted per year until 2022 at which time the rate would slow to 5 
million tons per year through 2026 and the tail off in 2027.

its pit floor is a skinny, irregular shape, only ~65 meters at its widest point and narrowing to 
about half that at either end.  AKG might have as few as two benches of depth (at 18 meters per 
bench) in Nkran that it is able to mine.  
 
With uncertainty hanging over the quantity and quality of ore below, the company faces a 
dilemma: should it risk running out of money by pushing back the walls, or admit defeat and 
move on from Nkran, but likely without the liquidity needed to generate meaningful cash flow 
from its other resources?  As of the end of FY16, Nkran has significantly underperformed the 
original 2015 mine plan despite mining so aggressively as to have removed 19% more ore than 
planned.  There was an -11% short fall in total gold production.5  Recent disclosures cause us to 
think the company will deem Nkran as pinched out, and it will therefore abandon the project.  In 
that case, if the 2.7 million tons of ore and 166,000 ounces recently reported as being accessible 
with minimal additional cost is all the mining management intends to complete at Nkran, then 
Nkran’s remaining LoM could even be less than half a year (which would reduce Nkran’s LoM 
to one-fifth or less of its original plan).6 
 
The satellite deposits will not save AKG in our view.  Nkran’s poor performance has meant that 
AKG lacks the cash flow to Esaase.  This has seemingly caused AKG to focus on small low 
grade “satellite deposits” to plug the hole.  Over the last year, AKG has repeatedly shuffled its 
satellite mine development plans, fast-tracking mines with near surface ores apparently to 
generate some cash flow.  Since Q2 2016 the satellite plan has changed on an almost bi-monthly 
basis.  The demotions of once promising deposits imply expected economics that are much 
worse than stated in AKG’s Mineral Resource Estimates (MREs).  These frequent changes also 
signal the company is desperate.  We believe these deposits will follow Nkran in disappointing 
due to flawed geology. 
 
We see AKG root problem as flawed geology.  The most recent evidence of the poor geology is 
the newest Nkran pit model, which significantly decreased the reserve estimates.7,8  An expert 
report we reviewed on the history of AKG’s MREs and other technical reports was highly 
critical.  The experts found significant flaws and omissions in the assumptions and 
methodologies, including possible “smearing” of the mineral resource model.  The report 
strongly suggests that critical flaws remain in the pit models for Nkran, Esaase, and the original 
satellite deposits including Dynamite Hill, which until May 23, 2017 was the satellite first in-line 


																																																								
5 Per the FY15 MD&A, total ore mining for 2016 was to be 3.943 million tons, from Q1 through Q4 4.676 million 
tons of ore were reported as mined (Q4 2016 earnings presentation, p.5, Q1 2016 MDA p 12).  Total 162,838 oz in 
total vs. the 182,428 in the Mine Plan reported in the 2015 Full Year MDA, p. 11). This includes 15,337 oz of gold 
recovered predominantly from inferred ounces in Q1 2016 which should not be depleted from its reserves/ 
resources.  
6 Based on recent mining rates which are predicted to remain unchanged.  As reported the strip rate for these is 2:1 
(Q1 2017 conference call). 
7 AKG, Technical Presentation, 2017-02-24.  Nkran’s reserve ounces were downgraded by 22.6%, a loss of 430,000 
ounces of gold.   
8 The “pit model” refers to the mineral resource block model which generates a geological 3D model based on data 
input from drilling of the deposit area, but as interpreted and adjusted per algorithms, design parameters, and the 
discretion of geologists who create it. In this report these 3D geological models may alternately referred to as a 
“block model”, a “pit model”, or “model.”

to be developed.9  In February 2016, AKG hired Philip Bentley as its Executive for Geology and 
Resources.  Mr. Bentley was the VP of Geology and Exploration of the spectacularly collapsed 
Great Basin Gold (GBG).  He was named as a defendant in a lawsuit over that collapse.  We 
wonder why out of all the potential geologists AKG could have hired, it settled on Mr. Bentley. 
 
AKG is significant risk of a liquidity crisis in 2018.  The company’s liquidity is limited to only 
$48 million of cash on hand, and it has zero availability on its $150 million revolver, which has 
accrued interest.10   If the company pushes back the collapsed wall at Nkran, we estimate it 
would consume $75 million to $115 million.  Using company-favorable assumptions, we believe 
the company will have a 2018 cash short fall ranging from -$43 million to -$129 million in 2018.  
 
If investors are surprised by the foregoing conclusions, they can be forgiven.  Management has 
often painted a “puppies and rainbows” picture of its operations, putting positive spins on news 
that should be unambiguously bad for the company.  This includes having made the spurious 
claim that no material change to its “global” MRE was justified.11  One of AKG’s most brazen 
deceptions has been trying to convince the market it is “conservative” and its planning is “bullet 
proof.”12While management outwardly exudes a sense of calm, we see a management that is 
desperately flailing around in search of cash flow.   
 
AKG investors appear to have been comforted by the backgrounds of chairman Collin Steyn and 
CEO Peter Breese.  The pair previously sold LionOre Mining International Ltd. and Mantra 
Resources Limited for significant gains in 2007 and 2010, respectively.13  However, a soberer 
assessment of their track record is that the buyers in each case were undisciplined, and it was in 
the midst or tail end of a bull market for the underlying commodity.14  There have since been a 
series of write downs and failures at Lion Ore, and Mantra has never gone into production.  The 
pair’s investments in Coalspur and Mirabella Nickel have been greatly disappointing.   
 
We doubt the company can avoid an expensive debt restructuring in the next 12 - 18 months. 
Management contends its cash flow and liquidity are sufficient to cover its near-term obligations 
and capital expenditure plans, and hopes to renegotiate an already onerous 7% interest rate.15,16  
However, it appears far from capable of generating enough cash to make repayment of the 
already once extended loan (currently at $165 million).

Our investigators in Ghana spoke with 21 sources who have extensive knowledge of the Nkran 
mining operation. These sources detailed serious concerns with the condition of the Nkran pit, 
where wall collapses have blocked access to the west ramp for over one month.  This is a 
problem for AKG, which is now left with a single functioning ramp as it enters Ghana’s peak 
rainy season.  The severity of this problem is magnified by cracks that have also appeared along 
the north, northeast, east, and southeast walls; and, which continue to present problems in the 
northwest and southwest corners.  Further, there have been smaller collapses in the pit.  Even in a 
scenario without additional wall failures, we estimate that Nkran may have as few as two 
benches of additional depth (at 18 meters per bench) that can be mined before “pinching out”.  
 
Nkran is already experiencing serious wall collapses 
 
Ghana’s monsoon season has two peaks commonly falling in May/June and August/September.17  
This year the heavy rains started in April.  Based on our review of satellite imagery, there are at 
least three areas in the pit that experienced major failures due to the 2016 rains.

May 2016 satellite imagery shows that the southern section of the west wall appears also to have

SW Corner of Nkran Pit, May 2016 
 


The west wall collapse is a problem because it limits access to one functioning ramp even before 
the start of the peak rainy season.  Several sections around the east wall above and below its 
ramp are also exhibiting signs of stress and being at a risk of further collapse.  A failure along the 
east wall would be a severe issue for AKG because it would cut off access to the ore at the pit 
bottom.  To stabilize the west wall and rebuild a new access ramp would require a large push at 
great expense.  AKG has not publicly estimated the tonnage involved in moving the walls back, 
but we believe it would exceed 37 million tons in order to expand the surface area of the pit and 
continue to access new ore zones at Nkran.
Page 9 of 43	


The west wall collapse is not trivial 
 
Nkran has recently experienced a 250-meter long collapse of the west wall, which according to 
our sources, has completely cut off access to the pit from the Western ramp since early April 
2017.   An approximately 175~200 meters long section of the west ramp appears poised to slide 
into the pit. The image below was taken on May 1, 2017. 
 








Close Up View of Nkran Pit West Wall Collapse, May 1, 2017 
 
Contrary to the narrative from management who, described the collapse as “just a little tiny 
portion of the pit ramp” and stated “the sidewall failure [as] very similar to the one [it] had last 
year”18,  this collapse impacts roughly a quarter of the pit’s rim.  AKG appears to have been 
unable to access the west ramp throughout May because of the wall failure.  AKG claimed the 
collapse has had no impact on operations, however, our sources indicated that with just one ramp 
in operation, the trucks entering and exiting the pit have encountered problems with bottle 
necking.

Corner.

In mid-May, after the Q1 2017 earnings call, we dispatched a second drone to survey AKG’s 
response to the wall collapse.  As is visible in the image below, the west access ramp has 
continued to deteriorate and appears inoperable.  An operation along the west rim is expanding, 
likely intended to remove weight (and therefore stress) to prevent another large or even 
catastrophic failure.

The west wall collapse is a sign of AKG’s desperation 
 
Despite seemingly being aware of the impending collapse of the west wall, AKG did not 
complete a pushback of the wall.  Instead, it focused on mining the guts of the ore body.  We see 
this behavior as extremely short-termist, and indicative of desperation. 
 
As shown above and below, by no later than Q1 2016, cracks large enough to be visible by 
satellites appeared along the upper areas of the pit.  Two such cracks were located in areas where 
walls eventually collapsed during last year’s rainy season.  The fourth area with significant 
visible cracks and fissures is along the upper section of the west wall that just failed.
Page 12 of 43	


AKG warned the market about the possibility of losing the Nkran pit on the Q3 and Q4 2016 
conference calls.  AKG’s apparent failure to act in the face of the risk of new wall collapses in 
2017 reeks of desperation.  In the Q4 2016 conference call, AKG management stated (emphasis 
added): 
 


“As explained last quarter, we have introduced a number of measures designed to 
mitigate the risk associated with a single-pit operation in a high rainfall area with deep 
levels of weathering. This places the mine at risk and could cause us to lose the pit for an 
extended period of time…”19 


 
Despite seemingly being aware of the instability along the western edge of the pit for over one 
year, AKG’s solution was not to adopt the seemingly obvious and necessary step of pushing back 
the pit rim and properly stabilizing it during the dry season, but to dig deeper, faster.20  Digging 
deeper, faster carries is risky because it increases the slope of the pit walls and increases the risk 
of collapse.  AKG then downplayed the significance of the wall collapses on the Q1 2017 call.   
 
Nkran might “pinch out” 
 
The company’s response to finding significantly less gold than estimated at Nkran was to 
aggressively mine the “guts” of the ore body. In doing so, it abandoned plans for ongoing wall 
pushbacks that would have allowed the company to slow-mine and slowly monetize what had 
been planned as a rich deposit.21  Now Nkran has now been mined into a steep “V” shape.  
 
We believe that the Nkran pit floor is fast becoming too narrow to mine, a condition known in 
the industry as “pinching out”.  At the point a mine pinches out, it is no longer economically 
viable to spend the additional capex required because the costs of moving waste rock are greater 
than the value of the ore being extracted.  Because of AKG’s aggressive mining, The lowest 
level of its pit floor is currently ~200 meters below the surface and less than ~65 meters at its 
widest points and narrowing to less than ~30 meters at its northeastern end.22

20 Not making the repairs during the dry season and awaiting the resumption of heavy rains makes earth moving less 
efficient (slower and more costly) but also risks further destabilization by adding weight and stress to areas already 
displaying compromised structural integrity.  For more information on the decision to dig deeper and skimp on wall 
pushbacks see “Early mining challenges” in the Technical Presentation dated 2016-05-11, pp. 30-31.  In May of 
2016, AKG reported that an additional wall pushback was done on the west wall due to geo-technical concerns 
(likely meaning concerns pertaining to the structural integrity of the mine wall), but as the west wall suffered a 
major collapse in early Q2 2016, the effort nevertheless seems to have been insufficient. 
21 AKG 2015 MD&A, p.11 The intention to slow mine Nkran is apparent in the mine plans it reported at the end of 
2015. Nkran’s LoM was to be 12.5 years with the ores blended from the satellite pits and later with Esaase’s.

A pinch out at Nkran in 2017 could be a fatal blow.  Nkran’s high grade ore was to be mined 
slowly, producing cash for Esaase’s development.  According to AKG, Esaase requires at least 
$100 million to $110 million of capex to complete its 27-kilometer overland conveyor system 
and get Esaase’s pit into production, plus another $25 million to $30 million to complete its 
expansion of the processing facility at Nkran that raises its milling capacity from 3.6 to 5.0 
mtpa.23   
 
Pushing back the west wall involves removing approximately 37 million tons of waste rock at an 
estimated cost of $75 million to $115 million.24, 25  AKG has not provided clear guidance on the

24 Within the 25 million tons of rock AKG projected 200,000 tons of ore. 
25 AKG’s DPP production data only runs until 2018 so it doesn’t capture all of the pushback required through what 
was initially termed “stage 4”.  An investor has asked the company for the estimated tonnage and cost to pushback 
the west wall but has to yet to receive it. We have used satellite images, company data, and the dimensions of the pit 
to calculate the tonnage to estimate the density of rock and cost of stripping.  This methodology was approved by a 
geological firm. We have estimated a conservative and a base case scenario and taken a 20% haircut to our base case 
estimate to account for being unable to more precisely estimate the top end of the range.  
Conservative assumptions – To access a significant part of the pit, AKG needs to pushback is at least 900 meters 
(length); the pit is currently around 200 meters in depth; we have also assumed AKG has to push the wall back at 
least 75 meters to sufficiently open the pit floor. 
 Base Case assumptions – To access a larger area of the pit, AKG needs to pushback 1,200 meters, the pit will be 
deeper by the time it pushes back (due to additional mining this and next quarter, 220 meters and we have also 
assumed AKG pushes the wall back 100 meters in order to maximize the ore it is able to access. 
 To calculate the volume of rock moved: Conservative - 900m x 200m x 75m = 13,500,000 m3. 
Base case - 1,200m x 220m x 100m = 26,400,000 m3. On p270 of the 2015 DRA we know the density rock at Nkran 
was 2.76 on average in the near surface so to calculate the tonnage we have: Conservative – 2.76 x 13,500,000 = 
37,260,000 m3 and Base Case – 2.76 x 26,400,000 =72,864,000 m3. To conservatively estimate mining cost we have 
used $2 per ton which was the cost of mining during the pre-strip in 2015.  This gives us a Conservative estimate of

exact size of the west wall pushback and did not provide a direct answer to the question when 
asked on the Q1 2017 conference call.26  We believe the company was avoiding answering the 
question because it is unclear how much of the wall it can afford to remove.  Because Nkran is 
still producing ore that is below the 2.03g/t reserve grades, we believe AKG might also be unsure 
how much additional ore it will access by pushing back the west wall.27  If the pushback is 
significantly smaller than 37 million tons, it is highly likely AKG will be unable to access 
significant new parts of the ore body, and Nkran’s LoM schedule will resultantly be cut short.28 
 
We estimate that if AKG decides to complete the pushbacks of the east or west walls needed to 
access new ore bodies, it will incur $75 to $115 million of stripping costs.  However, with 
question marks hanging over the value of the ore at Nkran, management faces an unpleasant 
dilemma. 
 
AKG’s quandary is that it needs to pushback the west or east wall to avoid pinching out.  This is 
essentially an additional pre-strip that AKG would need to do; however, doing so will require a 
substantial portion of its available cash.  The initial pre-strip of 28 million tons took thirteen 
months to complete, our estimate is that these 37 million tons would require the equivalent of 
approximately one year of time and commensurate expense. 
 
Nkran might have as few as two quarters of mining left 
 
AKG’s latest public statements lead us to believe that Nkran might be nearing the end of its 
economic life.  If Nkran pinches out this soon, AKG appears that it will be unable to fund 
Esaase, which is the deposit with the greatest estimated total reserve ounces and the objective of 
Project 5 million.  In the past month, AKG has made the following new disclosure on two 
occasions: 
 


“166,000 ounces already pre-developed at Nkran, which don't require any further capital 
development to access”29 – April 2017 
 
“To-date, the in-pit development work that we have done at Nkran gives us access to ore 
inventory of 2.7 million tons containing approximately 166,000 ounces that is ready to be 
mined.” 30  - May 2017 





																																																								
- $2 x 37,260,000 =$74.5 million; and, a base case of - $2 x 72,864,000 =$145.728 million, which then haircut to 
arrive at $115 million.

27 AKG, 2017-02-24 Technical presentation p.24 
28  Strip mining requires that waste material above an ore body be removed and the walls set back in a series of 
terraced forms prior to being able to access the ore below.  
29 AKG, press release, 2017-04-27 
30 AKG, press release, 2017-05-04
Page 15 of 43	


We believe the above statements may be a warning to investors as 2.7 million tons of ore at a 2:1 
strip ratio would give AKG as few as two remaining quarters of mining Nkran, even with rain 
hampering mining operations.31 
 
Phase One as planned in the DPP was to incorporate the five deposits and have a Life of Mine 
(LoM) of 12.4 years, during which time Nkran was to supply 88% of the total ounces.32   If AKG 
is only able to remove an additional 166,000 ounces from the pit, it will have removed only 
466,025 ounces (-79% compared to the November 2014 DPP).33 If this becomes the case, LoM 
for Nkran will have been less than 36 months, about one quarter of the original plan, and 
seriously compromising Phase One.34 
 


 
 
The Satellite Deposits are Unlikely to Yield Significant Cash Flow 
 
Most of the original satellite pits are no longer featured in the latest satellite deposit development 
plans (e.g., Adubiaso, Adubiaso Extension, the Nkran Extension).  The demotions, which are 
likely due to poor underlying geology or significant pre-stripping costs demonstrate wide-
ranging problems across the Obotan area. 
 
Originally the neighboring pit Adubiaso was scheduled to be the first to follow Nkran into 
production with ~10 million tons being extracted in 2017.35  It is featured in the 2015 LoM 
schedule presented below. 
 


																																																								
31 AKG, Q 1 2017 conference call. The company explained that it had a 2:1 strip ratio on the remaining 2.7 million 
tons of ore due to pre-development, this equates to less than nine million tons of mining. AKG mined six million 
tons in 1Q 2017 so we estimate around 1.5 quarters of mining remaining. 
32 2015-01-29 DDP p558 Nkran represents 87% of Phase One 
33 221,025 (total ounces mined as of Q1 2017) + 166,000 + 79,000 (stockpile Q4 2016 is the larger of two numbers, 
some of these ounces should be in the inferred category and should not be depleted).  
34 Based on recent mining rates which are predicted to remain unchanged.  As reported the strip rate for these is 2:1 
(Q1 2017 conference call). 
35 AKG, Investor Presentation, BDO Conference, 2015-02-20, p.5
Page 16 of 43	


 
 
We estimate that Adubiaso would have required AKG to spend $40 million removing waste rock 
before reaching the main ore body.36  After mining Nkran for a full year and finding less gold 
(and producing less cash), the company appears to have been unable to afford Adubiaso’s pre-
strip.  In an apparent attempt to overcome this problem, AKG started to look for deposits with 
near surface mineralization.  In February 2016, the company announced a new "Short-Term 
Strategy" targeting “near-mine, near surface deposits.37  In practice this means that AKG was 
looking for ounces that didn’t require it to spend much money to extract.  
 
The production schedule continues to be constantly revised, with the development priorities 
being reshuffled each time. The September 2016 version is below and displayed the prominence 
of the Adubiaso and Nkran Extensions. Since September 2016, it has changed another four 
times, and Adubiaso Extension, and Nkran Extension were cycled out of the line up entirely. 
 


 
 
Over the last year, the company’s quest for near surface ore has involved changes to the 
announced satellite deposit development plans and sequencing on an almost bi-monthly basis.  


																																																								
36 Based on 2014-01-09 Phase One DPP p426 fig16-40 & 16-41. Based on information provided in the DPP we 
calculate AKG would be required to remove 19.8Mt of rock to reach the main ore body at $2 per ton which was the 
cost to move rock during the 2015 pre-strip of Nkran.

The most recent change took place on May 23, 2017, when Dynamite Hill was postponed again 
and Akwasiso was advanced to the front of the schedule. 
 
Delays and changes to AKG’s satellite deposits and expansion plans 
 


• February 2016 new Phase One mine plan “Short-Term Strategy” targeting Near-Mine, 
Near Surface Deposits.  Abore, Asuadi and Esaase all dropped or scheduled for later in 
mine plan. 


• May 2016 Adubiaso and Dynamite Hill will be in production at the end of FY 2016 and 
Q1 2017 respectively. 


• August 2016 Nkran extension and Adubiaso extension will be mined in Q1 2017.  They 
were not previously part of the Phase One mine plan. 


• September 2016 Akwasiso introduced into the mine plan, and planned for mining in 2H 
2018.   


• October 2016 Nkran extension will now be mined in 1H 2017 and the Adubiaso 
extension will be mined in 4Q 2016.  The Nkran extension and the Adubiaso extension 
were both going to be mined in Q1 2017 previously. 


• December 2016 Nkran extension and Adubiaso extension planned for later in revised 
LoM.  They were previously scheduled for mining in H1 2017 and Q4 2016, respectively. 
Esaase has been delayed, and is now scheduled to begin producing ounces in 2H 2018, 
when it was previously supposed to come online in Q3 2017.   


• March 2017 Dynamite Hill to commence mining in 2H 2017, having previously been 
scheduled for production in Q1 2017.   


• April 2017 Dynamite Hill to be mined in Q3 2017, Akwasiso now scheduled for mining 
in 2017, having previously been 2018.  Esaase production delayed from 2018 until 2019. 


• May 2017 Dynamite Hill mining delayed from H2 2017 until 2018. 
 
The subsequent demotion of the Adubiaso and the Nkran extensions imply their expected 
economics are poor.  Neither Adubiaso nor the Nkran Extensions remain featured in the latest 
satellite deposit development plans, even though these are two of the original satellite pits.  Their 
ultimate demotion in the schedule contradicts May 2016 claims that these deposits were “early 
successes”.38 
 
We theorize that the Adubiaso Extension no longer features in the mine plan because once AKG 
analyzed grade control drill results from Q3 2016, it realized the Extension likely did not contain 
significant amounts of gold.39  In October 2016, AKG stated it would be mining the Adubiaso 
extension in 4Q 2016.  However, Satellite analysis shows that after grade control drilling the 
Adubiaso extension in Q3 2016, little to no further activity took place on site.  AKG seems to 
have quietly walked away.40

40 By December 2016 the Adubiaso extension was pushed to later in the LOM.
Page 18 of 43	


 
 
The Nkran extension was also quietly dropped.  The deposit was supposed to be mined in Q1 
2017,41 then pushed to H1 2017,42 and later dropped from the mine plan.43  AKG had reported 
these two extensions were fully permitted as of the end of 2016. 44   
 
It is somewhat ironic that despite having four other major deposits in the area around Nkran, and 
having conducted extensive drilling to delineate extensions to two previously developed pits 
(Nkran and Adubiaso), AKG’s current “best prospect” is not among this group.45 Akwasiso is a 
satellite deposit newly acquired in Q3 2016, that AKG has fast-tracked and now resides at the 
forefront of its development plan.   
 
We are skeptical about the potential of Dynamite Hill 
 
AKG seems to have soured on developing Dynamite Hill.  There are strong indications that prior 
models for the deposit were “smeared”.  Until very recently, Dynamite Hill had been scheduled 
to be the next satellite deposit scheduled for mining.  On May 23, 2017, AKG abruptly 
announced that it will now be mined sometime in 2018. After reviewing an expert evaluation of

44 AKG, 2016 AR MDA, p. 28 section on “Current Operations” reports that Adubiaso is permitted and ready, while 
the Annual Information states that it was already being mined.  “The Company received the permit for the Adubiaso 
Extension in Q3 and completed initial grade control drilling in Q4 2016, progressing the deposit to be mine 
ready.”2016 Annual Information, p. 49, “The Company received the permit for the Adubiaso Extension at the end of 
Q3 2016, completed initial grade control drilling and commenced mining in Q4 2016. The permit for the Nkran 
extension was received in Q4 2016 with mining expected to commence in Q1 2017.”  P. 54 “Mining operations are 
expected to begin immediately following the receipt of the permits.”   
45 The previous best prospects were Dynamite Hill, which itself was preceded by the Adubiaso and Nkran 
Extensions.

AKG’s geologist reports, we suspect AKG sent this pit to the back of the line because it now 
believes the economics of mining it are less attractive than previously thought.46  
 
We believe that the most recent (February 2017) MRE contains flaws similar in scope and form 
to those of earlier Nkran estimates.  There are indications the models have been smeared, which 
means to overweight positive results – extrapolating them out broadly – but underweight or 
ignore “zero intercepts.”  In the latest February 2017 MRE, CSA’s new estimate for Dynamite 
Hill presented an 86% increase in its ounces (130,000 oz.).47  As no technical report was released 
with the latest MRE, we reviewed data provided in the original 2014 MRE for Dynamite Hill.48  
This was carried out by CJM in 2014 and the DDP was based on this data.  We believe this 
original estimate for Dynamite Hill likely contains data from the original MRE, which stated 
that:  
 


 “development of the Dynamite Hill model [drew] on the geological information gained 
through the development of the litho-structural models for the Nkran, Adubiaso, Asuadai 
and Abore deposits.” 49   


 
Cross-section views of the Dynamite Hill block model generated by CJM MRE show high-
grading blocks penetrated by drill holes whose gold interception data points were below the cut-
off grade and at zero.50  The image on the left is from the DPP and shows a section of Dynamite 
Hill depicting the limits of the indicated resources, the drill holes, and the values of the ore 
grades intercepted in the holes as the drilling penetrated the ore body.  The image on the right is 
the section of Dynamite Hill and overlays the 3D block model on top of the drill holes and 
intercepts.  The three ballooned sections provide a close-up view. 51  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
																																																								
46 We reviewed an independent structural geology report that speculated a faulty understanding of the structural 
geology and inadequate modeling controls were major contributors to the problems with the resource estimates on 
the deposits at Obotan and Esaase, implying that Dynamite Hill will likely display similar issues. 
47 AKG, Technical Presentation, 2017-02-24, p. 23-24. The new estimate is 2.62 million tons of ore grading at 1.60 
g/t and yielding 130,000 ounces. 
48 We reason that a substantial upgrade would need to build upon the previously established estimates. Had CSA 
found problems, it would have been difficult to downgrade the resource and also nearly double its estimation of the 
gold it may contain. 
49 AKG, CJM 2014 MRE, p. 9 and 2015 DRA DDP, p. 571 
50 AKG, CJM 2014 MRE, pp.163-164 
51 The color coding indicates different ore grades.  Green is the cut-off grade.  Yellow, orange, pink and purple 
represent incrementally higher grades.  The blue is low grade ore and the lighter grey equals no ore (or “zero 
intercept”, “null value”).
Page 20 of 43	


The three ballooned sections are populated with large amounts of green, orange and pink, 
indicating that substantial amounts of ore at well above the cut-off grade should be present in 
these areas.  These blocks are intersected by drill holes that contain continuous intercepts with 
long sections of “null values.”  This presents a simple contradiction.  The drill data indicates 
there is no ore in the location with the null values, but the model indicates there is a continuous 
body of above cut-off grade ore in and all around the same place.  The model appears to have 
been smeared: Set up to over-weight positive results - extrapolating them out broadly - but 
under-weight or ignore “zero intercepts.”  
 
There are clear indicia of sloppiness in the Dynamite Hill MRE and DPP that call the substance 
into question 
 
Glaring typo-s in the publicly available 2014 MRE and 2015 DPP report sections documenting 
the statistical analysis at Dynamite Hill shows a surprising level of sloppiness, and call into 
question how diligently the work was performed.  In the below statistical analysis we see that the 
inputs in the “Num records” (Number of records) column have also been pasted in the 
“Minimum g/t” column. This is not the only error. The numbers in the “minimum values” 
column exceed the numbers in the “maximum values” column and the “average values”. In short, 
Dynamite Hill’s entire statistical analysis table makes no sense. The erroneous data was later 
copy pasted from the MRE into the DPP. Given that the DPP report was prepared by DRA, a 
different mine consulting company from CJM Consulting, it is alarming that this wasn’t 
caught.52

Next mine up: Akwasiso 
 
We see more signs of desperation when reviewing the acquisition of, drilling program for, and 
fast-track permitting of Akwasiso.  Despite owning ~679 square kilometers of unexplored land, 
and five near-mine satellite deposits, the company opened negotiations on near-mine acquisition 
targets.  By Q3 2016 it closed on the Akwasiso concession for $8.6 million in cash and 
shares.53,54  The infill drilling (used to confirm the presence of mineralization) continued through 
April 2017. 55,56  On May 23, 2017, ALTO advanced Akwasiso to the top of the satellite mine 
development plan, scheduling it for H2 2017.57   
 
AKG’s sudden resumption of exploratory drilling in 2017 strikes us as a desperate attempt to hit 
a large high grade deposit that could potentially save the company (or at least distract the market 
from the serious problems at Nkran).  In April, the company disclosed that a large portion of its 
exploration budget, which had grown approximately four times from last year, had already been 
used to drill out recently-acquired Akwasiso.58,59,60  The speed with which this new deposit 
accelerated through the ranks of AKG’s satellite pit development plans, in our opinion, further 
underscores the company’s desperation and the lack of potential of the other satellite deposits.   
 
A skeptical interpretation is that the company accelerated Akwasiso’s drilling so that it could 
first “bulk up” its December 2016 MRE and generate another upgrade (+26% to its reserve ore 
tonnage and grade, 65% to its ounces) just before release of its new LoM and multi-pit

Even as upgraded, Akwasiso still represents just 4.3% of the company’s total “global” reserves.63 
 
AKG’s QP Phil Bentley – about whom we have concerns due to his role at failed Great Basin 
Gold Ltd. – was responsible for the technical contents of Akwasiso’s resource estimate; a new 
AKG QP, Mineral Resource Manager, Kathleen Hansmann, prepared the MRE; CSA Global’s 
Malcom Titley “signed off”.64   However, as the same $2,000 gold price pit shell cut off was 
applied again, we view the resource totals with a considerable degree of skepticism.65 
 
A different AKG QP, Frederick Fourie, was responsible for the reserve estimates.  The cut-off 
grade for the reserves was raised from 0.5 g/t to 0.8 g/t.  This seemingly conservative change 
might give investors greater confidence in the modelled results; however, the same thing 
happened with the 2014 MRE for Nkran, which later turned out to be too optimistic.66 
 
Despite including Akwasiso in the December 2016 MRE and subsequent upgrade in April 2017, 
AKG has provided little technical information about the deposit.  AKG’s recent press releases 
repeat that “minimal pre-strip or development work” is needed to access incremental ounces 
from oxides.67  In the March 8, 2017, press release AKG selectively presents drill data from 
2017, as well as two cross sections featuring in bold what we suspect are three of the most

grades were improved by 24% from 1.20 to 1.49 g/t, yielding an estimated 322,500 ounces.

when other improper constraining parameters are originally selected.

promising intercepts.68  This seems to not conform with NI 43-101 practices.69,70  Therefore, the 
degree to which the deposit can deliver low-cost, near-surface ounces in the oxides for an 
extended period, whether it will rapidly transition from scooping out oxides to mining ore from 
the hard granite, or is likely to be another “nuggety” or “erratic” deposit, is not possible to 
assess.71,72,73   
 
With our doubts about the geology of Akwasiso, it is valid to ask what portion of the 430,000 
ounces already lost from Nkran in the Dec 2016 downgrade can actually be made up by 
Akwasiso.  More importantly though, if Nkran fails either due to a mine-closing wall collapse or 
simply pinches out, and over 1.2 million ounces are lost, neither Akwasiso, Dynamite Hill, nor 
the two combined meaningfully narrow the resource gap AKG will need to bridge.74   
 
Flawed MRE Analyses are at the Root of AKG’s Problems   
 
The root of the problem for the company has been, and remains, overly optimistic Mineral 
Resource Estimates (MREs).75  A December 2016 MRE decreased the estimated gold contained 
in Nkran and Esaase by $581 million.  While this MRE seems to bring expectations more in line 
with reality, we have reason to believe the new Nkran estimate is still flawed.  Reported Q1 2017 
grades at Nkran fell 11% short of the stated reserve grades in the new MRE, and Q2 2017 is 
projected to be similar into mid-June.76  Nkran’s measured resources have shrunk dramatically (-

of the block models.   
69 AKG presents the positive results, but promising to release details on the mining rate, grades, pre-strip in technical 
reports to be released at a later date. 
70 Under NI 43-101 guidelines, exploration results must not be disclosed selectively, and selective bolding of best 
results should be avoided.  The best practice is to post all drilling and assay results on the company website. See

71 AKG, press release, 2017-04-27, and others.  Multiple press releases note Akwasiso’s geology is similar to 
Nkran’s and other satellite deposits and that ore is in "an intrusive granite which hosts a shallow dipping quartz 
veining". 
72 AKG, press release, 2017-04-27, The data table presented in the March 8, 2017 press release shows just 28 drill 
hole results with an average of 1.89 g/t, but a median of just 1.1 g/t, suggesting a nugget deposit is possible.  The 
nearby satellite pit Adubiaso was described as “erratic” when mined. 
73 The April 27, 2017 press release contained a note indicating changes to the MRE methodology, utilization of 
oriented cores, improved definition of the grade shells using physical wire-framing and ordinary kriging (OK) 
estimation, which should all help improve their modelling.  If modelled in such a way as to consider the complex 
geology, constrain the ore body, prevent smearing, properly weight “zero intercepts”, and limit other excessive over-
extrapolation problems that appear present in past model, investors should have a better idea of what is in the 
ground. 
74 1.47 million ounces listed in Nkran’s constrained and depleted December 2016 MRE –  Q1 total of 58,187 ounces 
depleted plus the166,000 ozs reported as easily accessible = > 1.2 million ounces.  Not only will these satellite 
deposits incur direct mining costs, but also come with logistical, scheduling, and management costs and challenges.   
75 Mineral Resource Estimates are prepared by QP’s and split the mineralized ore body into three classifications: 
Inferred (lowest level of confidence), Indicated (reasonable level of confidence) and measured (high degree of 
confidence of grade, tonnage, shape, densities, physical characteristics and mineral content). 
76 AKG, Q1 2017 conference call, Peter Breese replied to a question about how grades were just 1.8 g/t for Q1 2017 
and when grades would should be expected to achieve the updated reserved grade levels, “I guess, so just the mine 
grades, we expect and it was part of the budget, we expect the mine grades to stay at around about those levels for 
about another six weeks from now. And then we’ll return those to the Life of Mine plan, which is roughly 2 grams a 
ton.”

22.6%), while growth of indicated and inferred make up some of the difference.  The cutoff 
grades for Nkran and Esaase were lowered dramatically, which also raises eyebrows. 
 
Alarmingly, the same MRE increased the value of satellite deposits using a highly questionable 
assumed gold price of $2,000/Oz., which is way out of line with AKG’s peers.  AKG has not yet 
released a technical report that would shed light on the reasonableness of the upgrades to the 
satellite pits – investors should demand AKG do so immediately. 
 
Nkran does not contain the gold AKG and investors expected 
  
By the end of 2016, it was already clear that AKG’s aggressive mining failed to reach high 
grading ores or deliver the quantity of ounces predicted.  It succeeded only in removing more 
material and depleting even more ore from the “guts” of the deposit. 
 
The mine plan provided from 2015 contains data on the intended ore grade to be mined by year.  
The first two years of mining were to deliver rich ore at average mined grades of 2.44 g/t in 
2015, 2.15 g/t in 2016, and 2016 feed grades reaching 2.58 g/t.77  However, AKG reported no ore 
for 2015, and mined grades never exceeded 2.0 g/t in any quarter in 2016.78  Feed grades from 
the three quarters of 2016’s commercial production were also disappointingly low, reported at 
just 1.7, 2.1, and 2.1 g/t, 18.3% less than the 2.58 g/t average feed grade predicted.79

The table below shows the significant gold deficit versus plan (-10.7%), despite having mined 
18.9% more ore than planned.  AKG was to have mined 44.9 million tons of material from which 
3.9 million tons of ore would yield 187.4 thousand ounces of gold.80,81  However, at the end of 
2016 over 51.0 million tons of material were mined, depleting 4.7 million tons of ore, and 
yielding just 162,838 thousand ounces.82

The 2016 figures reveal aspects of AKG’s aggressive mining.  Not only was 26.2% more ore 
extracted without delivering the gold, but it also removed 16.5% less waste material.  This might 
seem like a good thing, but if AKG continues to mine Nkran, that material will need to be 
moved.

The December 2016 MRE seems to true up Nkran geology flaws, but still raises questions  
 
CSA Global generated constrained and depleted MREs for Nkran and Dynamite Hill as of 
December 31, 2016.8384  CSA Global also performed a review of Esaase, but did not rerun its 
MRE.  AKG’s December 2016 MRE is the combined product of two different consultants using 
CSA Global’s results for Nkran and Dynamite Hill but CJM Consulting’s results for the rest. 
 
The table below presents the differing results for Nkran between the new/updated CSA Global 
results for Nkran’s MRE from those generated by CJM, which produced the prior 2014 MRE.  
Nkran lost -3.05 million tons of ore, had -12.1% cut from its grades, and erased 430,000 ounces.  
The net effect was to downgrade Nkran’s value by approximately $490 million.85, 86

Even with CSA’s lower reserve grades of 2.03 g/t, AKG is falling short. In Q1 2017, reported 
grades for the quarter were only 1.8 g/t, or -11% below the stated reserve grades.  Q2 2017 was 
predicted to be similar through at least mid-June.87  The recently disclosed remaining 2.7 million 
tons of ore that AKG is readily available to mine is forecast to produce grades of just 1.91 g/t.88

Resources.90,91  The Measured Resources are shown in red, and Indicated are in orange.  Despite 
a 37.5% reduction in the cut-off grade, the Measured have clearly and dramatically shrunk 
exactly below the area where mining and grade control drilling has been focused.  
 


 
 
Perhaps most surprising is that the downgrade to Nkran occurred despite a 37.5% reduction 
(from 0.8 g/t to 0.5 g/t) to the cut-off grade for its Resources at its deposit.92  Esaase likewise 
experienced losses despite a 16.7% reduction (from 0.6 g/t to 0.5 g/t).93  The reduction in the cut-
off grade reduces the hurdle rate for assessing whether an ore body’s estimated gold content is 
sufficiently high to be classified as a resource.  All other things being equal, the relaxation of a 
critical constraining parameter should allow more ore and more ounces to enter the model.  This 
was the case for all the other satellite pits.  However, at Nkran and Esaase, the two largest and 
most important deposits, the reduction of the cut-off grade was not able to offset the reduction in 


																																																								
90  A Measured Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, densities, 
shape and physical characteristics are so well established that they can be estimated with confidence sufficient to 
allow the appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support production planning and 
evaluation of the economic viability of the deposit. The estimate is based on detailed and reliable exploration and 
testing information gathered through appropriate techniques from locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes that are spaced closely enough for geological and grade continuity to be reasonably 
assumed.  An Indicated Mineral Resource is that part of a Mineral Resource for which quantity, grade or quality, 
densities, shape and physical characteristics can be estimated with a level of confidence sufficient to allow the 
appropriate application of technical and economic parameters to support mine planning and evaluation of the 
economic viability of the deposit. (the remainder of the definition of indicated matches that for measured.) 
91 The difference between the Measured and Indicated is the degree of confidence that the findings are well 
established and supported by detailed and reliable data, properly drilled, collected, and tested.  
92  Management’s casual categorization of the two cut off grades 0.8 g/t to 0.5 g/t with a 37.5% difference as being 
“very similar” numbers is also rather questionable.   
93 AKG, Annual Information, p. 36, different cut-off grades were used to estimate the Obotan and Esaase pits.

ore and ounces.  Had the cutoff grade been left unchanged; the loss of ore and ounces would 
have likely been considerably greater.  
 
The justification for significantly reducing the cut off grades was that production inputs in the 
Whittle parameter, including lower mining and processing costs, process plant throughputs, and 
gold recovery rates had all improved.94,95  We believe this may be optimistic.  Over the last three 
quarters the company’s operating costs, as measured by its AISC, are trending 14% - 22% above 
the estimates generated in the Phase One DPP and were projected to rise in 2017.96  Furthermore, 
per the Phase Two PFS, as AKG progressed into Phase Two, its AISC was expected to increase 
slightly.97  
 
Record gold price assumption helps AKG reassure investors 
 
Because Nkran is expected to fund the Phase Two(a) / Project 5 Million expansion plan and 
developing Esaase, the resource downgrade would seem to be a crippling blow.  Even worse, 
Esaase Main also lost 2.9% of its reserves.  Although small in percentage terms, it amounts to a 
loss of ~80,000 reserve ounces, or a $91 million decline in the value.98  CEO Breese’s statement 
below provides the likely reason AKG’s stock has not yet cratered in the wake of the Nkran and 
Esaase downgrades:  
 


“Our global gold reserves have remained largely unchanged at 5 million ounces, 
supported by the successful 2016 near mine exploration program which added over 
300,000 low cost ounces to the mineral inventory, offsetting mining depletion. We are 
very excited by the exploration potential that the AGM complex holds and anticipate 
adding more ounces to our resource base during 2017 from a considerable list of near 
mine high priority targets.”99 


 
The $581 million downgrade of Nkran and Esaase was largely offset by upgrades to satellite pits 
that relied in part on increasing the assumed gold price to $2,000 / oz., which is way out of line 
with AKG’s peers.  The table below present the impact of the changes to the reserve estimates by 
deposit.

95 Whittle Pits are a modelling tool used to delineate and define the shape and form of the mine to be constructed 
and then assist in selecting an optimal size for the pit itself to maximize the economic return from the investment in 
mining.  Whittle Parameters are the constraints applied to the pit model.  These may include a wide range of 
economic, operational factors, including: the market price of the commodity, operational costs, selling costs, 
discount rate, recovery rates (from processing), dilution rates (from mining/processing) as well as geological and 
geotechnical considerations, etc. Transparency into these parameters was limited.  As we found numerous instances 
where we believe that the company would present only positive information and withhold other findings showing 
“bumps and warts”, and their reported mining costs coming in well above estimates used for the initial DPP cost 
models, we find their reduced overall cost projections that allow a lower cut-off grade to be questionable. 
96 All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) are a non-GAAP metric developed by the World Gold Council and used in the 
mining industry for measuring costs.   
97 AKG, Phase Two PFS, DRA, 2015-06-29, p. 566.  AISC for Phase One and Phase Two were projected to be $781

the ground.100  Moreover, AKG also will now have to mine out an additional 4.05 million tons of 
ore that will likely require 16 million tons of waste, an additional estimated cost of $50 million 
and still extract less gold than planned under its prior MRE.101

over 16 million tons of waste. This totals to 20.3 million tons of material.  At the reference mining cost used in 
Esaase’s PSF (p. 403) of just $2.59/t which is much lower than Nkran’s current $3.89/t, the mining cost to get back 
to “no material change to global reserves” it likely to be over $50 million.

The table below presents the gains and losses by deposit for both Measured and Indicated (M&I) 
Resources and Proven and Probable (P&P) Reserves.  By adding new satellite deposits and 
increasing the resource and reserve estimates at all the original deposits, the total estimated gold 
ounces loss of -490,000 oz. from resources and -510,000 oz. from reserves is nearly offset by an 
addition of 420,000 oz. to resources and 370,000 oz. to reserves.

AKG stated that it adopted the new MRE “to be prudent…[and] elected to use the more 
conservative.”102   However, the new “conservative” measured, indicated, and inferred mineral 
resources uses a $2,000/oz. gold price to define the gold pit shell.  This is now included as a 
“constraint” based because the prior MRE’s Measured and Indicated category contained no such 
limitation or parameter at all.  As a $2,000/oz. price is ~60% higher than recent market prices 
and one which has NEVER been attained.103  Comparable mining companies appear to be ultra-
conservative:

AKG updated its MRE, but failed to provide a new technical report 
 
Despite significant changes to the company’s MRE, AKG did not release a new technical report.  
Without a technical report, investors are unable to assess the suitability or accuracy of the inputs 
that define and control the zones of mineralization in the new CSA block models.104  This 
suggests significant resource and reserve over-estimates might still plague Nkran.  This is also 
likely the case for all other satellite pits, which have MREs based on the original and, in our 
opinion, potentially flawed models.   
 
AKG’s justification for not releasing a new technical report after the major December 2016 
downgrade to Nkran is that there was “no material change to the global reserve inventory”.  We 
disagree that this justifies withholding the report.  In the revised MRE, Nkran and Esaase lost a 
combined 490,000 reserve ounces while the satellite deposits added 370,000 ounces.105   The 
composition of its six original deposits were significantly revised and five new deposits were 
added. Investors should note that CJM performed most of the revisions to the original deposits 
and reviews of the new deposits, which is the same firm that provided the original MREs for the 
other Obotan satellite pits and Esaase.  Investors should demand AKG release not just the 
technical reports for all 11 deposits, but include their individual 3-D block models, complete drill 
data sets, and a complete reconciliation of production back to the original CJM block model.

AKG’s Looming Liquidity Crisis 
 
AKG is at very high risk for a liquidity crisis in 2018.  When factoring in the seemingly binary 
possible Nkran outcomes of either an expensive west wall pushback or pinchout, we expect the 
company to run out of cash in 12 – 18 months.  The company’s liquidity is limited to only $48 
million of cash on hand as of Q1 2017, and it has no availability on its $150 million revolver 
with Red Kite.  We adjusted the company’s Source and Uses table for 2017 below, using the 
company’s assumptions (although we believe its assumptions are aggressive).  
 
The company adds in receivables to its cash on hand, which we see as aggressive because 
receivables are not always liquid and the full amount might not be collected.  However, we used 
the company-favorable $66 million cash number for the beginning 2017.  For 2017, we used 
management’s guidance, despite having proven unreliable, and added Phase One of the wall 
pushback costs.    
 
If the cost for the west wall pushback is in the mid to upper end of our estimates, the company 
could experience tightening of liquidity in 2017 with problems manifesting in 2018.  We 
estimate that excess liquidity carried into 2018 could range from $24 million -$8 million, 
assuming a $1,200 gold spot price.106  These assumptions do not include lower production, 
higher potential costs, or capex increases.

When we carry the AKG’s excess liquidity into 2018, and include the company’s amortization of 
the loan and second phase of the wall pushback, we project the company has a cash shortfall 
ranging from -$43 million to -$129 million.  
 
Assumptions for 2018 Sources and Uses Case: 
 


• Production Assumption: Production of 176,156 ounces on the high end and 111,364 
ounces on the low end.  Reserve of Mine (RoM) stockpile plus the Marginal Ore 
stockpile as reported in the February 24, 2017 press release.  In the low-end production 
assumption, we discounted the RoM Stockpile by 12% per the December 2016 
downgrade to reserve grades at Nkran.

Nkran Extension  8,889   -    
Total Production 
(ounces)  176,156 111,364 


 
• AISC Assumption: We assume AISC drops to $777/oz, which is substantially lower than 


their 2017 guidance and where the company have been averaging.  We arrive at this 
number by lowering operating cash costs and royalties by 25% from 4Q16, which was 
the lowest quarterly reported AISC in the last four quarters. According to management,
Page 35 of 43	


one reason the AISC is lower is because the company will be mining from the oxides in 
the satellite deposits which are lower cost.   


• VAT Recovery remains the same in 2018 at $15 million. 
• Total Capex of $63 million in High End and $70 million in low end: The capex planned 


for Project 5 million is to be $100 to $110 million for the mine and overland conveyor 
project and $25 to 30 million for upgrading the processing facility. Total $125 million to 
$140 million of capex. A total of $72 million of capex was planned for 2017 and $63 
million for the remainder in 2018 for a total of $135 million. 


• Wall Pushback Phase 2:  We estimate the total cost for the wall pushback to be in the 
$76 million to $116 million and take place in 2H 2017 and 1H 2018 in order to keep the 
mine operational. For 2018, the wall pushback costs range from $38 million to $58 
million. 


• Principal Payment for Loan: The loan payment to Red Kite occurs on July 1, 2018, 
October 1, 2018 and January 1, 2019 at about $15 million per quarterly payment (or $45 
million in 2018), not accounting for accrued interest.  This loan payment will be ongoing 
for a total of ten equal payments.  Interest on the loan is about $11 million per year.

If AKG determines that the wall pushback comes at too great a cost and the economics of further 
developing Nkran are no longer attractive (which we suspect may be the case), it might decide to 
stop mining the deposit.  In this scenario, it might find that only a very light pushback around the 
pit might be sufficient to stabilize the mine long enough to extract the remaining 166,000 pre-
developed ounces it has identified below the pit floor.107  A lower cost pushback would conserve 
some cash and sustain liquidity, but entail walking away from the company’s most highly valued 
asset.  We see the secondary effects of that being a significant loss of confidence from 
shareholders, negatively impacting the stock price, and shutting off even the remote possibility 
of a substantially dilutive equity raise.   
 
Red Kite Loan 
 
Red Kite, the company’s sole lender, has already amended AKG’s credit agreement multiple 
times.  The most recent was during Q2 2016, when the revolver was amended to defer repayment 
of principal for two years. There was a 2% penalty on the loan ($3.275 million) and the revised 
interest rate of 10.5% on the $17 million accreted portion of the loan is a significant increase 
from the LIBOR + 6% being paid on the balance.108  Investors should be wary of any additional 
dilution from further pushing back the debt repayment.  In December of 2015 – before AKG’s 
problems were nearly as apparent as they are now – the company issued Red Kite warrants for 
four million shares (~2% of fully diluted shares then outstanding) in exchange for waiving the 
3% drawdown fee.109  Now the revolver is fully drawn, and the company continues to burn cash.  
We question whether the company will be able to pay its first $16.5 million installment due July 
1, 2018.  AKG is obligated to make additional $16.5 million payments every three months 
thereafter. 
 
AKG’s cash flow forecasts should be given no credence  
 
The company continuously guides for positive free cash flow, however it has consistently 
missed.  For example, for 2016 AKG guided for $74 million in “post-tax cash flow”, but ended 
up burning free cash of -$114.1 million.110  For 2017, the company is guiding to $89 million in 
post-tax cash flow, however we expect free cash flow to be effectively breakeven at best.  Below 
is a slide in from the December 7, 2015 investor presentation in which the company expected 
2016 post tax cash flow in the $74 million to $89 million range assuming $1,200/Oz.  The 
company ended up with negative -$77.4 million of free cash flow in 2016.

Note that the company was guiding for AISC in the $748 to $786/Oz range in these slides 
above.111  However, the company missed its AISC by a wide margin and attained $893/Oz in 
AISC Q4 2016, but has since increased to $956/Oz in Q1 2017.112  
 
Below is another overly optimistic projection the company made in November of 2014, 
forecasting 2017 free cash flow to be in the $100 million to $143 million range.  
 





																																																								
111 All-in Sustaining Costs (AISC) are a non-GAAP metric developed by the World Gold Council and used in the 
mining industry for measuring costs. AKG’s AISC is calculated as: Total Cash Costs (Operating Cash Costs + 
Royalties) + Corporate Costs + Sustaining Capex + Deferred Stripping Costs + Reclamation Cost Acceleration.   
For more information see “EY, All-in sustaining costs and all-in costs”, Americas Mining & Metals Forum, 
September 2013. AISC includes operational stripping costs, Corporate G&A (including share-based comp), 
amortized reclamation and remediation costs (for operating sites), (sustaining) exploration and study costs, 
Capitalized stripping (sustaining) costs, (sustaining) capex.”   
112 Note the AISC in the $748 to $786/oz range in the November 2014 presentation.  According to the company, 
AISC attained a low of $893/oz in Q4 2016, but has since increased to $956/oz in Q1 2017. AKG, Q4 2016 and

Everything is NOT Ok, Management is Not Conservative  
 
Investors seem to give AKG management more credit than we think it deserves.  We have noted 
two instances in which management has stated material facts that are simply untrue, and are in 
complete opposition to prior disclosures AKG has made.  It is deeply disturbing that AKG has 
delayed releasing its block model reconciliation for over a year, giving reasons that we do not 
see as valid.  On the surface, Peter Breese and Colin Steyn have a solid track record of exiting 
resource investments, but there are countervailing facts of which investors should be aware.  
Finally, Breese and Steyn have taken significant money off the table, which we believe is a sign 
of lost faith in the company. 
 
AKG cannot seem to get its story straight on relocating the village at Nkran 
 
Management’s statements regarding the Nkran Village Relocation Plan (RAP) are contradictory. 
AKG originally stated the RAP was completed in September of 2015, which would have been on 
time per the original plan.  Six months later, AKG suddenly stated the relocation never 
happened.  With this admission, AKG had a reason to delay the pre-strip on the east wall.  
Another possible explanation for why AKG delayed the pre-strip is that it realized the grades in 
the pit weren’t reconciling with the model, and instead wanted to direct mining resources to find 
the ore with better grades. 
 
In February 2015, AKG projected the RAP would be complete by September 2015. 113 











																																																								
113 See p24 of https://www.AKG.com/assets/docs/2015-02-04_AKGCP.pdf for the original partial relocation action 
plan (RAP).
Page 39 of 43	


In December 2015, management reported the RAP was completed in September 2015 (on-
time).114 
 


 
 
Memory Hole:115 In May 2016, AKG presented an alternative version of events that directly 
contradicts the earlier information.116 





 
 
Our investigators visited Nkran village and learned that although a village moving ceremony had 
taken place in September 2015, the work had not been completed, and many villagers remained 
at the site past that date.  Ironically, this reportedly didn’t stop AKG from blasting, and 
damaging some villagers’ houses.  Reports also indicate that ongoing blasting is also damaging 
their replacement houses, and at least some villagers expect they will need to be relocated once 
again. 
 
The revised historical timeline is repeated on the Q3 2016 conference call. This time then-CFO 
Greg McCunn uses the “delayed village” as an excuse for failing to provide the market with a 
mine reconciliation and other issues (emphasis added):117

115 “A memory hole is any mechanism for the alteration or disappearance of inconvenient or embarrassing 
documents, photographs, transcripts, or other records, such as from a website or other archive, particularly as part of 
an attempt to give the impression that something never happened.[1][2] The concept was first popularized by George 
Orwell's dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four, where the Party's Ministry of Truth systematically re-created all 
potential historical documents, in effect, re-writing all of history to match the often-changing state propaganda. 
These changes were complete.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory_hole

“Dan, the block model reconciliation is obviously a moving part, because we have to look 
at different areas of the pit that are being mined, because some areas of pits are lower 
than where we said it's going to be. And some areas of the pit are higher than where we 
said it would be.  For instance, the western center part of pits is about 10 or 12 meters 
lower than it was meant to be and the eastern center of the pit is 45 meter higher than 
where it was meant to be. Going back to the original feasibility study. The very specific 
reason for that is which is unbeknownst to some people is because we have to do the 
relocation of the village and that was delayed.” 
 


In this instance, AKG appears to be using the village move delay as cover for several operational 
changes:  holding off on the east wall pushback, going deeper in the western center of the pit, 
and even an inability to reconcile its block model. 
 
Pre-stripping uncovers another memory hole 
 
AKG almost certainly incurred far more pre-stripping cost than planned.  Pre-strip is the waste 
material that must be removed to access reserve grade ore.  AKG’s Phase One DPP and mining 
plans from early 2015 called for a pre-strip at Nkran of between 18 million to 21.6 million tons. 
118  
Rather than make clear the original plan underestimated the amount of pre-stripping, AKG 
retroactively changed the original plan without making the change apparent to investors – it was 
as though the company hoped nobody would notice the difference.119  According to AKG’s own 
numbers, the final pre-strip total was over 28 million tons, which exceeded the high-end estimate 
of the originally planned total of 21.6 million tons by over 29%.120,121   This equates to ~5.4 
million tons or over $12.8 million in excess cost.122  AKG ignored these facts in April 2016 
(emphasis added):  
 


“the pushback …is advancing well, with a total of 28 million tons mined since mining 
operations commenced early in 2015 against a plan of 26.2 million tons.” 123   
 


AKG’s spin increased in July 2016, claiming to be ahead of schedule and within budget: 
 
“This is a remarkable achievement to get to steady state production levels within a six-
month period considering the fact that not only did we build the mine ahead of the plan and

text on pg. 425 of the DPP shows the pre-strip at 18Mt and 11 mos.  The charts on Pg. 426 converts to about 21.6 
Mt.   
119 Along the way, management also changed its view on the importance of the pre-strip to the achievement of mine 
performance targets and impact on the budget.

within budget, but at the same time and like the majority of new mine projects, we had to 
pre-strip well over 28 million tons from the historically operated Resolute pit”124 


 
AKG creates opacity by delaying release of its block model reconciliation for over one year 
 
Beginning in July 2016, AKG began providing dubious reasons for delaying releasing a full 
reconciliation of its original block model.  The essence of ore grade reconciliation is to assess 
actual production versus the model.125  We suspect that reconciliation back to the original Nkran 
block model will demonstrate that flawed geology underpins the original Nkran MRE.  
Management has offered the following reasons for not releasing the reconciliation (emphasis 
added):   
 


“We will anticipate that this reconciliation will take another six months of mining in the 
main mineral domain to be able to clearly reconcile our mineral resource to grade control 
and our reserve estimate to plan feeds.”126 – July 2016 


 
“We started to open up and now are getting into that main sandstones on to 
mineralization and the first month that we were mining that reconciliation was awful. 
And reason for that is you had a big high wall on the side of that and is was 
[indiscernible]. But that now is moving towards the east more and more and its opening 
up nice and widely just like we predicated and I’m sure that that reconciliation will 
improve and that’s why we said to the market is we will give the market update and those 
reconciliations next Jan." – November 2016 


 
“Due to the complexity in planning a schedule for 11 different pits and the detailed 
design process, we now anticipate publishing the expansion feasibility study in Q2 
2017.”127  - February 2017 


 
We do not take these explanations at face value.  In our view, the company has had all the data it 
needs to perform the reconciliations.   Satellite photos and drone footage show that grade control 
drilling has been ongoing in the pit.  Our investigator interviewed 21 mine employees who 
confirmed that company’s trucks are equipped with GPS. The location of each load of ore and 
wastes origin from the pit and its delivery point in the stockpile has been collected.128  
Nevertheless, the reconciliation has been delayed for over 12 months.  
 
AKG has now set a date of June 5th for the updated PFS presentation.  The company has 
indicated that any new reconciliations may be presented based on a new, revised block model.  


																																																								
124 AKG, 2Q16 Conference Call, July 20, 2016 
125 Variance can arise from any differences in any of the inputs.  A consistent record of poor reconciliation is an 
indication that this variance has not been adequately managed, or is originating from a factor (such as low ore 
grade) which cannot be improved - Amoako Richard, Al-Hassan Sulemana. Ore Grade Reconciliation Techniques 
– A Review. Journal of Geosciences and Geomatics. Vol. 3, No. 5, 2015, pp 116-121.

126 AKG, 2Q16 Earnings Call Transcript, 2060720 
127 AKG, Press Release, 2017-02-24 
128 Since the trucks were equipped with GPS, traceability of the loads from the mine into the stockpiles would be 
easily maintained, greatly facilitating and expediting reconciliation efforts.
Page 42 of 43	


Using a different block model for the reconciliation can be analogous to comparing apples to 
oranges.  Investors should hold management accountable and demand a reconciliation to the 
original block model.   
 
Senior management’s track record is less impressive than investors seem to realize 
 
To date, we believe the only reason investors stuck with AKG is because of the seemingly stellar 
reputations of Chairman Collin Steyn and CEO Peter Breese. Analysis of the LionOre and 
Mantra transactions suggests management sold assets to undisciplined buyers during a bull 
market, and that the aftermaths were punishing to the buyers.   
 
Lion ore  
 
Numerous red flags came to light after the sale of LionOre in 2007.  Peter Breese and Colin 
Steyn received a windfall on LionOre, selling the asset for $6.4 billion to Norilisk at the top tick 
of a bull market in Nickel.129  The premium price paid for LionOre was partially justified by 
Activox, a “proprietary technology.”  Within 12 months of the acquisition, Norilisk wrote down 
$490 million on the Activox technology, and over the next four years, the entire ascribed fair 
value of $706 million was written off.130, 131  Norilisk was forced write down an additional $1.09 
billion on the Tati Nickel asset purchased as part of the LionOre transaction.  The previous 
management (current management of AKG) seems to have substantially underestimated project 
costs in the feasibility study.132  
 
Colin Steyn’s Highland Park was an investor in Coalspur in April 2010.133  He was appointed 
Chairman in September 2011 alongside the appointment of Peter Breese who was appointed a 
non-executive director.134 After failing to gain timely approval for the Vista coal project the 
company struggled to raise equity financing and was acquired by K.C. Euroholdings for $0.02 a 
share in 2015, with investors suffering a 98% loss since IPO.135 
 
Mirabela Nickel, where Colin Steyn was appointed as a non-executive director did not fare much 
better. After disruption to its main supply contract with Brazilian metals producer, Votorantim

decision to postpone the project indefinitely. As a result, as at 31 December 2007 mineral rights presented within

Metais, in September 2013, the shares lost 97% of their value and remained suspended at $0.01 
when Mr. Steyn resigned his position in January 2014.136 
  
Breese and Steyn have taken significant money off the table 
 
Peter Breese and Colin Steyn have sold a substantial portion of their original holdings in AKG.  
The major sales of stock are likely to have occurred during 2015 via offshore share sales. In the 
Annual Information form filed with SEDAR we find the following disclosure:  
 


“Common shares owned by Highland Park SA are controlled indirectly by Mr. Steyn 
but will be distributed by Highland Park to the beneficial owners in 2015.”137  


 
In the year after this disclosure is filled we see Breese and Steyn’s combined position reduced 
from 8,524,423 shares to no more than 4,310,789 shares.138  Coincidentally at the same time 
the shares were distributed, AKG stopped breaking out the number of shares held by 
individuals and instead began grouping the entire management team’s holding.
