What Universal Display’s third quarter analyst
projections should obviously be.


Posted on November 6, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, November 6, 2013.    According to data compiled by the


OLED Association, OLED display shipments for mobile products


experienced a 7% increase in the third quarter versus the second


quarter. Universal Display Corp.’s (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) material


sales in the second quarter were $27.1 million that would result in


earnings per share of $0.03, excluding the Samsung licensing fee. If


UDC’s claims were accurate, UDC’s third quarter revenue should be


at least $29 million, but this is far higher than all analyst estimates.


Historically analysts covering UDC have shown huge variances in


their earnings estimates for UDC, and this has especially been the


case for the second half of 2013. Taking out the expected Samsung


license fee payment, analysts’ revenue estimates for the second half


range from $35 million to $52 million, the highest estimate being


nearly 50% greater than the lowest. The variance in EPS estimates


is even higher at 500%.


This suggests that UDC is providing confusing and incomplete


guidance. UDC earnings releases since UDC started reporting


Samsung license fee revenue under the August 2011 contract have


been dominated by UDC’s irregular disclosures and analyst’s


confusion. Added to this concern are UDC’s irregular accounting


policies. Today asensio.com published a report analyzing UDC’s


formal written exchanges with the Securities and Exchange


Commission concerning UDC’s accounting policies.


For the third quarter, all sell-side analysts, including the Goldman


Sachs analyst, are estimating a decline in material sales from the


second quarter, without providing any explanation for the decline


versus the increase in actual OLED display unit sales.

UDC’s analysts’ are projecting sales declines for the third quarter


despite the fact that OLED display shipments increased 7% in the


third quarter over the second quarter 2013, according to data


collected by the OLED Association. None of the analysts has


articulated why they are projecting a sales decline, why they


believe that material sales will fall, quarter-over-quarter, in a


quarter where actual reported OLED display shipments increased.


UDC’s analysts travel with the company management to road shows


and host private and public investor meetings with UDC’s


management, but failed to provide investors with information


about the declining material sales that UDC had been experiencing


for over the last year. The red emitter sales decline suggest that


Samsung’s purported green emitter and host material purchases


will quickly follow the same path and that green material sales will


show the same drastic price and volume declines shown by UDC’s


red emitter sales.


We think that analysts are hedging uncertainty about UDC’s results


by lowering third quarter revenue forecasts. What will ultimately


determine UDC’s value, however, are the results of patent


challenges, especially the key patent case that will be decided after


a November 21st hearing.
