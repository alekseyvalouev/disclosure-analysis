HARBIN ELECTRIC: IF THE
BANK THINKS IT WORTH
$7.00, THEN CITRON
THINKS IT’S WORTH
$7.00…..OR LESS.


  Harbin Electric
(NASDAQ:HRBN) Does their
buyout story really make any
sense?
 


 





Citron has received worldwide press exposure for its
�rst-in-the-market commentary exposing China
MediaExpress (CCME) and Longtop Financial
(NYSE:LFT).  The driving force of our commentary has
been and will continue to be simple common sense. 
Whereas most analysts are busy listening to the
company or blindly vouching for management’s
statements, we reference a more profound source —
the simple question, “Does this make any sense?”  So
in keeping with the spirit of that question we present to
you Harbin Electric.


On October 11, 2010 The Harbin board announced it
received a “proposal of going private” from its
Chairman Mr. Tianfu Yang.  Notice a proposal is not a

buyout o�er — it is just that — a proposal.  To Citron,
this is like a “promise ring” exchanged between
teenagers.  It is now eight months later and we still
don’t have our engagement; shareholders just stare at
their promise ring with hope. 


Citron asks…”Does this make any sense?”  Let us
examine the deal.


When the proposal was announced in October…it was
pre-RINO, pre-CCME, and pre-Longtop.  (These three
notorious blowups have set the tone for �nding fraud
in China stocks over past 8 months).  Note to Harbin
management:  “If you couldn’t secure the �nancing in
October…than good luck trying now.”


  Listen to the Bank
 


One month after the CEO put the promise ring on the
�ngers of shareholders, he turns around and enters
into a term loan facility with China Development Bank
for $50 million.  Yet, the bank does not securitize this
loan with the assets of the company or with its cash
�ow.  Rather, the bank collateralizes the loan with 7
million shares of Harbin stock pledged by the CEO …
with provisions calling for him to pledge additional
shares of stock if the price goes lower.  At the time of
this transaction, he pledged stock worth $140 million
USE collateral value for a $50 million loan.  What does
the bank know that we don’t?


Well, if anything, this transaction created one powerful
incentive for the CEO to keep his stock price higher.


   SEC vs SAIC
 


Those who believe SAIC �lings do not make a di�erence
are invited to skip this paragraph. 


The reason Citron believes SAIC �lings are relevant in
the case of HRBN, is that the sources of funds for
Harbin’s proposed going-private transaction are money
from within China — whether it be a partner or a bank. 
Is it so far fetched to believe that possibly the banks in

China rely on documents produced in China?   Citron
has obtained copies of the HRBN SAIC docs from two
di�erent sources and they paint a completely di�erent
�nancial picture of the company than it presents in its
SEC �lings.  Below are the Chinese copies of the SAIC
docs along with a spreadsheet summary of the
numbers comparing them to SEC �lings.

The takeaway from Citron is that the SAIC �lings reveal
low pro�tability and undisclosed liabilities.   After the
“Longtop �asco” we understand that hidden liabilities
are a larger and more real concern than ever.  The SAIC
docs from Harbin and Shanghai Tech Full Electric
reported consistent losses in both �scal years 2009 and
2010. The Harbin subsidiary lost 1 million and 3 million

USD in the two years respectively and the Shanghai
subsidiary lost 2 million and 1.3 million in those two
years.


  IS THIS WHAT THE BANK
KNOWS??
 


A simple consolidation of HRBN’s four subsidiaries
based on subsidiaries’ Chinese �lings showed no more
than $12 million USD of pro�ts versus $80 million net
income reported on its SEC �lings in the year 2010.
Additionally, it appears HRBN grossly understated its
liabilities on its SEC �lings when compared with a
consolidated version including all of its subsidiaries.
HRBN showed a total liability of $180 million on its SEC
�lings while consolidation of its subsidiaries yield a
total liability of $244 million; similarly in year 2010, its
SEC liability was $151 million versus a consolidated
$276 million shown on the SAIC docs.  


  What a buyout should look like
… if it was real.
Nine months ago when this “proposal” was released
management could argue that things are done
di�erently in China and shareholders need to
understand.  Sorry, we now see that is just not true. 
Just last week China Fire’s (CFSG) management agreed
to a buyout with Bain Capital.  In that deal, we see a
de�nitive partner in Bain and de�nite closing dates.  On
May 31, we witnessed 2 deals get done.  The �rst was
an investment into (YONG) from Morgan Stanley, a deal
that posted with a �rm closing date June 10, 2011.  The
next is taking private of  Funtalk China Holdings (FTLK)
by Fortress for cash. 


Of course, Citron cannot validate that all of these deals
will get closed.  But lets look at the 3 key aspects that
they all have.


 1.  There is de�nitive funding.


 2.  There is a de�nitive partner.


 3. There is a de�nitive timeline.

With these 3 engagements from strong suitors on the
table, Harbin Electric shareholders are obligated to look
at their promise ring with wonder, doubting if it is
nothing more than a cubic zirconium.


The overarching issue that de�nes HRBN as a complete
outlier in these private equity transactions is the
purported price of the deal.  All of the above stock
transactions are priced relative to a trading range for
the stock.  The most real of the above deal appears to
be FTLK which is being acquired for $7.20 a share, a
midpoint of where it has traded over the past 52
weeks.


At $24, the HRBN buyout promise is a price the stock
has seen only on three brief visits during its entire
trading history – once in 2007, and the others after the
deal was announced.  Other than that, there is zero
credibility to this price – it is simply made up. 


After all, their last quarter results re�ected a disastrous
compression of margins that would have sent a normal
stock reeling lower, especially considering the debt load
of the company.


   What are They Hiding?
 


Beyond the alleged unstated liabilities and lower
revenue numbers, Harbin is a business without much
sizzle.   HRBN was a reverse merger which has rolled up
various electric motor manufacturers, is the primary
operator of a large, antiquated, formerly state-owned
electric motor manufacturing facility.  The company has
burned over $90 million in cash, and would require a
huge new capital investment to reach a tenable
position in the current intensely competitive
landscape.  Their 40-year-old factory, which makes
small motor parts, appears to be everything but state
of the art.


So, let’s assume for a moment that the buyout o�er is
not real, and cannot be consummated.  Why does the
company �nd it necessary to keep this crutch?  It is the
opinion of Citron that without the buyout o�er, this
stock could see single digits as investors realize they
own a piece of China’s past, and not its future.  As long

http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-if-the-bank-thinks-it-worth-7-00-then-citron-thinks-its-worth/ 6/7


as the CEO can continue to put out press releases of
advisory committees and 8-K �lings alluding to “wink
wink” conversations with analysts, the charade will
continue.


Note to Harbin management:  If you are serious about
buying the company, then take the ridiculous $24 price
o� the table, let the stock trade freely, and only then
go in and buy it at a signi�cantly discounted price to
today’s o�er  … then maybe you can get your �nancing
and gain some credibility with Wall Street and your
bank �nanceers.


 


  Bottom Line
 


If HRBN couldn’t secure �nancing when the story was
good, how can they do it now?    


Harbin and the Chinese RTO space is no longer hot nor
sexy.  In fact, it is toxic.  Harbin operates an old world
manufacturing plant, producing largely commodity
products at slim margins, with rapidly escalating prices
for materials and labor.  And of course this was BEFORE
the SEC task force on China RTO’s, before the halts,
when it seemed like a good idea to take it private.  It is
Citron’s opinion that investors had better ask
themselves what this stock is worth without the buyout
o�er. 


        


  The Company’s Response
 


We can predict it now.  The company is sure to respond
with a PR insisting its “special committee” is continuing
its work to further the proposal.  Or maybe we will read
about a formal o�er made by the CEO “contingent on
certain �nancing”….  We can even read of a fancy law
�rm or investment bank that has been hired to move
this proposal along.  Not to mention, we will likely read
about the evil short sellers who are out to “get the
company” … IT IS ALL WORTHLESS RHETORIC!  There is

only one thing the company can do at this point …
SHOW US THE MONEY AND CLOSE THE DEAL! 


Anything short of a de�nitive closing is a
disappointment and worse, it is a sham.  It is the
opinion of Citron that this deal will not close – not at
$24, and not at a price above half of $24. 


Cautious investing to all.
