Gulf Resources: Financial Claims Are Beyond Reason

A report that was published by Glaucus Research Group on April 26th highlighted the
many shortcomings of Gulf Resources (GFRE), a Chinese firm that manufactures
bromine, crude salt and related chemical products. The Glaucus piece builds a convincing
case that Gulf misrepresents itself in its SEC financial filings.


Among other items, Glaucus shows that the company's claimed assets appear to actually
be owned by a private conglomerate owned by GFRE's chairman, and not by Gulf.
Glaucus also argued that local Chinese filings show a much smaller business than is
indicated by SEC filings, that the company's largest customer is an undisclosed related
party, and that Gulf's initial reverse merger partner was China Finance, Inc., which
vanished from the public markets in 2009 with no explanation and was an organizer of
other dubious Chinese reverse merger companies like Orient Paper (NYSEMKT:ONP) and
Universal Travel Agency (UTA).


Given that there was other material to focus on, Glaucus did not devote much time to
address the company's extraordinary business claims.


In this article, we will explain why certain of Gulf's business claims are too good to be true,
with a focus on the most important financial metric of all: profit margins. In particular, we
compare the financial metrics of GFRE to those of three other comparable companies:
Great Lakes Chemical, Israel Chemicals (OTCPK:ISCHY) and Haiwang Resources.


Haiwang is a particularly applicable comparable because the company is a direct
competitor to GFRE. It manufactures a similar portfolio of products in the same region as
Gulf and filed an S-1 (.pdf) with the SEC earlier this year.


Below is a comparison of the two companies' segment breakdowns:

See GFRE's 10K (.pdf) and Haiwang's S-1 (.pdf) for supporting documentation for the
above graphs.


For Great Lakes, we use data from 2004 (available here (.pdf)), the last year prior to its
being acquired by Crompton Corp. Bromine, crude salt and chemical products
manufacturing has stayed sufficiently competitive since 2004, such that Great Lakes'
financial figures from 2004 should be applicable.


Israel Chemicals, whose annual report is available here (.pdf), features a smaller bromine
segment as percentage of sales than our other comparables, but nevertheless provides a
useful data point when examining GFRE's too-good-to-be-true operating metrics.


As a final point, we also discuss how we could not find Gulf's subsidiaries or its products
on three leading Chinese vendor transaction websites, but were able to locate their
competitors. This is highly unusual given that GFRE claims to be "…one of the largest
producers of bromine in China…"


PROFIT MARGINS


In the table below, we compare GFRE's profit margin to that of the three comparable
companies:


GFRE's profit margins in 2010 are not outliers; the company has posted an EBITDA
margin of 40% to 50% since 2007 (see the GFRE 10Ks for 2009 (.pdf) and 2010 (.pdf)).
These margins are extraordinarily high when compared to the comparable companies. We
remind investors that GFRE operates a commodity business, and does not benefit from
unique technology, brand recognition or other competitive advantages. Rather, the
company credits the following as drivers of its business:

We compete in our business based on price, our reputation for quality and on-time
delivery, our relationship with suppliers and our geographical proximity to natural
brine deposits in the PRC for bromine, crude salt and chemical production.
Management believes that our stable quality, manufacturing processes and plant
capacity for the production of bromine, crude salt and chemical products are key
considerations in the awarding of contracts in the PRC. (source (.pdf))


It is highly unusual, and in our opinion nearly impossible, for a commodity manufacturer to
consistently produce the types of margins typically only achieved by the likes of Microsoft
(NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and other businesses with unique products,
unless the commodity sector is benefiting from abnormal supply-demand imbalances.
Judging from Haiwang's S-1 (.pdf), we can see that bromine manufacturers in Shandong
are not benefiting from any unusual supply-demand dynamics.


According to this S-1, there are approximately 75 licensed bromine producers in Weifang
City, Shandong Province, which produces approximately 85% of all the bromine produced
in China. We spoke with representatives from multiple bromine producers in Shandong
province, including Shandong Longwei Group Company Limited, Shandong Haihua
Group, Sinobrom Albemarle Bromine Chemicals Co. and Haiwang. Based on our
discussions, the production methods and sources of brine for the manufacturers in the
Shandong province are relatively indistinguishable. Given that Haiwang and other
competitors appear to be reporting reasonable margins, it's likely that GFRE's true
margins are materially lower than its reported ones.


Furthermore, there is ample evidence that bromine manufacturing in China is only
marginally profitable. Bromine in Weifang City is produced from brine water which is
concentrated seawater that is found underground, as is explained in Haiwang's S-1. The
bromine concentration of the brine water available in China is similar to that of ocean
water (for instance, see Albemarle's graphical depiction here). As can be seen from the
chart, bromine production from Chinese brine water is less efficient than production from
other brine sources, such as those available in the US or the Dead Sea.


For instance, this Haaretz article writes about how bromine manufacturing in China
"border[s] on economically unfeasible levels because the concentration of bromine fell
from 0.3 grams per liter to 0.2-0.18 grams per liter, compared to 10-12 grams per liter in
the Dead Sea".

Extracting bromine from less concentrated brine sources requires different methods of
production that increase production costs (see here). The mothballed factories that GFRE
has acquired to support its alleged increase in production capacity are likely orphaned
facilities that are indistinguishable from the many small producers in the area.


In short, bromine manufacturing for Shandong producers like Gulf is a high-cost
enterprise. In light of this fact, Gulf's high reported margins are difficult to believe.
Furthermore, it is especially difficult to believe that a Chinese producer like Gulf can
achieve dramatically higher margins than producers like Great Lakes or Israel Chemicals,
which benefit from more attractive sources of brine water, modern facilities and economies
of scale.


INVENTORY TURNS


We will also compare Gulf's inventory turns to those of the comparables. Below is a
comparison of the inventory turns of Gulf Resources to comparable companies.


GFRE reported inventory turns of 48x in 2010, compared to a range of 3x to 7x for the
comparable companies. Inventory turns of 48x are unusually high regardless of the
industry. It's particularly suspicious for a chemicals business. GFRE's inventory consists of
raw materials and finished products. Raw materials to produce bromine, crude salt and
brominated specialty chemical products include brine water, chlorine, sulfur, vitriol, ethane
and ethyl ether. Brine water is pumped from underground through extraction wells, passed
through transmission pipelines, moved to a refining plant, and oxidized through the
addition of chlorine.


The resulting bromine is then blown out using compressed air and absorbed by sulfur
dioxide or soda, while the remaining brine water is pumped into brine pans where it is left
to evaporate. Companies like GFRE and Haiwang then sell some of their bromine
supplies and use the remainder to manufacture chemical products. This manufacturing
process is described throughout GFRE's and Haiwang's annual reports, including here
(.pdf).

Given this manufacturing process and the finished products of both bromine and chemical
products, we do not believe that the company is able to turn over its inventory every 8
days. In its S1, Haiwang discusses how it stores its inventory to receive additional revenue
from price hikes.


DEFICIENT PRESENCE IN MARKETPLACE


In searching the internet to locate a suitable bromine manufacturer in China, there are
many sites available for buyers. The primary sites are:


www.icis.com - provides chemical and energy market intelligence and a supplier search
function.


www.chemnet.com - Chinese business-to-business website focused on the chemical
industry.


www.alibaba.com - small business e-commerce site representing multiple industries.


The competitors named in the filings of GFRE and Haiwang were easy to find on the sites
mentioned above. The table below lists the firms that GFRE and Haiwang describe as
their competition in their 10K and S1. It also indicates which supplier sites their products
are showcased on.


Finding a supplier site with GFRE's products was more difficult. After conducting a
supplier search, we found no mention of Gulf Resources or its operating subsidiaries
(Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company and Shouguang Yuxin Chemical Industry
Company) on www.chemnet.com, www.icis.com or www.alibaba.com.
