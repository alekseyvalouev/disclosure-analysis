TAL Education: A Real Business With Fake Financials 
Part II 


 
Comment to Investors 
 
TAL’s reaction to our 70-page exposé is stunning and affirming.  Its response, which could have 
been typed out while sitting on the toilet, has wholly failed to address our conclusions that a) its 
reported profits are fraudulently inflated, b) it engaged in two sets of non-substantive 
transactions, including having reported a divestment that did not actually occur, c) it likely 
diverted funds through a straw party, and d) is covering up a more substantial compression of its 
core business operating margins.  The failure to respond in our view evidences utter contempt for 
investors and the U.S. markets. 
 
TAL’s directors claim to have carried out an investigation into the issues raised in our report 
within 12 days.  Their statement is confined to only 51 words discussing the investigation.1  
Given there has been no attempt to convince investors there was any investigation, it’s hard to 
even label this one a “sham”.  Investors should be under no illusion that this statement is 
anything other than a long, fat middle finger extended their way.  This behavior underscores our 
point that managements and directors in China see no disincentive to steal money from U.S. 
investors – it is a “heads I win, tails you lose” bet for them. 
 
We began our series discussing two transactions where not only is the evidence of fraud is, in our 
view, clear and convincing; but, the impacts can be quantified.  From the outside, fraud is usually 
difficult to quantify – even analysts who specialize in detecting fraud usually struggle to estimate 
its impact.  Based on feedback, we believe there was some misunderstanding by investors about 
the impacts of the fraud we detailed in Part I.  The fraudulent inflation was not limited to below-
the-line (i.e., non-operating) income inflation.  Deferred revenue without matching expenses is 
an above-the-line profit inflation technique, which we illustrate in a reported vs. estimated real 
margin comparison table on page 3 of the initial report.   
 
We continue our series of reports with a look at another transaction with a quantifiable above-
the-line impact, Firstleap.2  We focus on Firstleap second also because it is a bit of a brainteaser 
– we invite investors to try to reconcile to the numbers TAL reported.  Taken together, Parts I 
and II show the variety of levers available to TAL to fraudulently inflate profits – all three 
transactions are obscure transactions to which investors seemed to pay scant attention at the time, 
and yet they have each made material contributions to profit overstatements.   
 
Our next report in the series will detail our conclusion that TAL commits fraud in the financials 
for its core Peiyou business.  The Peiyou fraud is more difficult to quantify, but our research 
suggests fraudulent overstatement of Peiyou revenue of approximately 25% to 30%.  Future

TAL’s profits are not sustainable. 
 
 
Firstleap: Another Fraudulent Accounting Lever 
  
Like Shunshun and Guangzhou One-on-One, Firstleap was one of TAL’s major investments in 
FY2016 and FY2017.  Management claimed deferred revenue of $45.09 million at the time it 
acquired Firstleap, which is a tutoring institute for pupils ages 2-15.  That number strikes us as 
steep.  Join us as we use generous assumptions to see how close to $45 million we can get. 
 
First, Facts 
 
On January 22, 2016, TAL reported that it completed the acquisition of 100% of Firstleap.  The 
purported purchase price of $46.58 million, paid for partially with TAL common stock, gave 
TAL a network of 66 learning centers, of which 30 were self-operated and 36 were franchised, as 
well as $20.94 million in cash.3 
 
Picking over TAL’s blogs shows tuition is Rmb 15,000 for 8 months, with payment due at 
enrollment.4  The schedule is rolling, so students can enroll any time.5  On the Q2 call, CFO 
Rong Luo noted that total enrollment as of the end of August 2015 was “around” 20,000 
students, while trailing twelve-month revenue was $30 million.6  Let’s say Firstleap had 21,000 
students—again, we’re just giving TAL the benefit of the doubt. 
 
We also have Firstleap’s onshore historical revenues, expenses, and gross profit.  Much of the 
financials for Firstleap’s network of learning centers flowed through the Beijing VIE, Beijing 
Lebai Educational Consulting Co., Ltd (BJ Lebai), and we show these in the table below.

4 These are recent tuition rates, which were higher than prior rates and are thus more favorable to TAL.  Per blogs on 
TAL’s jzb.com website (http://www.jzb.com/bbs/thread-5862433-1-1.html), most comments were that ¥15,000 was 
required for 8 months. 
5 Per calls to Firstleap’s customer service line. 
6 TAL FY2016 Q2 conference call, CFO Rong Luo: “Firstleap now operates 66, double 6, learning centers in 25 
cities.  Of these, 36 centers are self-operating and 30 are franchise.  The numbers of students in August 2015 was 
around 20,000.  During the period from September 1, 2014, to August 31, 2015, all the tier revenue per book was 
around USD 30 million, 3-0.  Firstleap is a lossmaking at the moment.  With cross-selling on our platform, we can 
help to lower down the new customer acquisition costs for Firstleap.  We expect this business to become profitable 
within 2 to 3 years, with a profit margin of between 10% to 20%.”

And it’s Gone 
 
Next, we need to make some estimates to obtain a reasonable deferred revenue number for 
Firstleap.  As in the table above, from CY2014 to CY2015, Firstleap’s gross revenue grew 
52.8%, while TAL’s filings show total revenue growth of 42.9% in FY2016.7  Therefore, it 
seems more than fair to TAL to assume 60% run-rate enrollment growth for Firstleap in August 
2015.8  If we increment enrollment by 4% every month—a CAGR of 60.1%—we get 25,265 
Firstleap students as of January 22, 2016.   
 


 
 
If Firstleap collected tuition of roughly 15,000 Rmb from each of the 25,265 students enrolled, 
that means it received prepayments of 379 million Rmb, or about $58 million, from those 
students.  Let’s recap what we have so far: 
 


 
 
However, out of the total prepayments collected, a significant chunk had already been 
amortized.9  To get at the percentage of deferred revenue remaining, let us look at eight generic

8 This is also well above TAL’s 42.9% revenue growth in FY2016.  Source: TAL 2016 20-F, p. 3 
9 The tuition for the Firstleap classes is collected in advance.  The term is eight months, but a rolling enrollment 
policy is in place.  Therefore, new students can sign up at almost any time.  If no new class is starting, they will

monthly cohorts that have month-on-month enrollment growth of 4% and pay a fixed tuition.  
We want to see what portion of the total tuition paid by these cohorts remains as deferred 
revenue.  The tuition rate and starting student population do not matter, so we can choose round 
numbers. 
 


 
 
As we can see above, out of the prepayments collected, only about 59% remain after a full 
student cycle.  Applying that fraction to the 379 million Rmb in prepayments from before gets us 
to about 223 million Rmb of deferred revenue, or $34 million.  Uh-oh: that is 25% below the $45 
million TAL booked.  But we’re not done yet. 
 
There is a haircut we need to apply.  It is a dry but important one—FASB section ASC 805.  
According to ASC 805, at the time of an acquisition, the acquired company’s deferred revenue is 
no longer recorded at the amortized value of the cash received.10  Instead, it is booked at fair 
value, which is equal to the acquirer’s future costs to fulfill the obligations, plus a reasonable 
margin that a third party might charge.  For TAL, this would just be the marginal cost of 
delivering additional lessons; sales, marketing, G&A, and other expenses already incurred would 
be excluded.  Let us use the Firstleap Beijing VIE financials from before to see what sort of a 
cost structure is reasonable.   Gross costs, meaning cost of goods sold and sales tax, were 52% 
and 64% of revenue in 2015 and 2016, respectively.  Let us assume that 60% of revenue was 
consumed by the marginal cost of service provision as of the acquisition date.11  After putting a 
reasonable margin of 10% on top, 70% of deferred revenue is matched to costs.  In other words, 
that implies a mandatory 30% discount to pre-acquisition deferred revenue.  We reproduce the 
figures and math below. 
 


																																																								
normally be placed into a current class.  As a result, deferred revenue as at January 22, 2016 will be a combination 
of prepayment balances remaining from prior and new enrollments. 
10 The deferred revenue lost due to the “haircut” is never recorded post-acquisition.

https://www.journalofaccountancy.com/issues/2016/apr/deferred-revenue-accounting-rule-in-acquisition.html 
http://holtzmanpartners.com/where-did-my-revenue-go/, 
11 This is favorable to TAL, as lower gross margins mean a smaller cut to the deferred revenue balance.
Page 5 of 7   


 
 
After we make this final adjustment to the 223 million Rmb deferred revenue balance from 
before, we get 156 million Rmb of deferred revenue at fair value—or, just $24 million.  Based on 
the calculations we made, TAL overstated Firstleap’s deferred revenue by 90%.  Almost half 
of the $45 million TAL claimed was fake.  We bring together our findings and assumptions 
below:
Page 6 of 7   


You Just Read the Charitable Interpretation 
 
There is a twist.  We assumed that the ~20,000 Firstleap students mentioned by TAL’s CFO 
belonged only to Firstleap’s self-operated network.  If that number he cited was inclusive of the 
franchises, which constitute 55% of Firstleap’s centers but generate little revenue, then the 
deferred revenue overstatement is even more hideous.12  Let us dig in. 
 
We assume that the $30 million in revenue comes only from self-operated centers.  Using the 
same 60% annual enrollment growth as before, we need to figure out how many students were 
enrolled at Firstleap’s owned centers of August 2015.  Before August 2015, tuition had been 
1,375 Rmb per month.13  If we assume the 12 monthly cohorts through August paid 1,375 Rmb 
while enrollment grew 4% each month, we can figure out the size of the student body needed to 
bring in $30 million.  At August 2015, that number was about 14,435.14  Here is the math: 
 


 
 
Now that we have the number of students as of August 2015, we can apply the same 4% monthly 
growth rate as before to obtain Firstleap’s enrollment as of the acquisition date: 17,367. 
 


																																																								
12 Based on a 2013 article we reviewed, it seems that Firstleap’s revenue from franchisees might be only 5% of their 
total sales; to be company-favorable, we exclude any franchisee revenue contribution here.  
http://learning.sohu.com/20131021/n388611760.shtml  
13 We use the lower pre-acquisition tuition because it is company-favorable.  A blog post stated that the tuition 
charged in August of 2015 was 11,000 rmb for 8 months after the application of a 1000-Rmb discount.  (Source: 8
个月，128个课时，一周上两次，一次一个半点，算两个课时。收费 1万 1千多（优惠 1千后），也就是 1
次课 1个半点 170块钱。) 
14 To be favorable to the company, as February of 2015 was the month of Chinese New Year, no revenue was 
calculated; however, we continued to apply the CAGR to increase the enrollments.

If we once again assume an eight-month tuition of 15,000 RMB, then carry out the same deferred 
revenue adjustments as we did before, the fair value of Firstleap’s deferred revenue comes out to 
$16 million.  This is an overstatement of over 175%.  Under these conditions, actual deferred 
revenue would be just over a third of what TAL recorded.15 
 


 
 
 
Conclusion 
 
The deferred revenue in the Firstleap acquisition appears to be inflated by 2x to 3x or more.  
Since TAL claimed the $45.09 million in deferred revenues upon acquisition in January 2016, 
most, if not substantially all, of the inflation of $21 to $29 million or more would have flowed 
through the FY2017 income statement.  


																																																								
15 If the lower tuition rate of Rmb 11,000 were applied, it would have driven the estimated fair value of deferred 
revenue at January 22, 2016 down by another ~25%.
