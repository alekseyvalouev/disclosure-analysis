A Violent Correction Could Be Coming for Hampton Roads

On April 23, 2010, we wrote an article entitled "Pacific Capital (NASDAQ:PCBC): A Violent
Correction Could Be Coming" that presaged the 77% collapse in PCBC's stock. In that
piece, we highlighted the speculative capital that was chasing small cap distressed banks:


Examples can be seen with the stocks of Dearborn Bancorp (NASDAQ:DEAR),
Banner (NASDAQ:BANR), and Preferred Bank (NASDAQ:PFBC). Possibly the most
mind boggling example is Pacific Capital.


Since that article was published, the stocks of the four referenced banks have been
crushed, including a 77% decline in PCBC's shares. 


Price 4/23/10 Today Return


PCBC $134.00 $30.80 -77%


DEAR $3.97 $1.15 -71%


BANR $57.05 $18.00 -68%


PFBC $3.38 $1.49 -56


We recently came across the most outlandish bank dislocation since PCBC -- an anomaly
we believe is only temporary due to an unusual addition to the Russell 2000 Index.
Historically, bank stocks have not been able to maintain speculative share increases over
any reasonable time frame. Banks are heavily regulated entities that are required to hold
specific levels of capital. Investors can look at decades' worth of data to justify reasonable
rate returns and the appropriate premium or discount on that capital.
While bubbles in bank stocks tend to be ephemeral, there are examples (like the ones we
highlighted last year) of bubble-type moves over limited time periods. These bubbles can
be driven by short-term dislocations, greed, or even by algorithmic high frequency trading.
We believe investors in Hampton Roads Bankshares (NASDAQ:HMPR) have been
subject to one of these unique bubbles and potentially face 50% to 80% downside from
current levels. HMPR is one of the most expensive banks in the U.S. based on every
conceivable valuation metric (price to tangible book, price to book, market cap to assets,
market cap to loans, and market cap to deposits).

But it isn't solely valuation that is a red flag. The company also faces the crippling
combination of nasty credit issues, a sizable capital hole, and limited profitability even
when excluding credit costs. Ironically, HMPR actually has one of the worst credit profiles
of any U.S. bank. Despite a huge capital raise in the second half of 2010, HMPR has a
large capital deficiency again. In addition, according to the company's filing, as of April
2011 the SEC is conducting a "formal investigation related to certain accounting matters"
and the company received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice,
Criminal Division last fall.
As the bubble in HMPR's stock price deflates, any investor who does not take advantage
of the current supply/demand imbalance may be subject to the same type of violent
correction that PCBC investors experienced.
A Quick History of HMPR's Blow-Up
HMPR is a Virginia-based bank with $2.7 billion of assets and branches in Virginia, North
Carolina, and Maryland. It operates under three brands: Bank of Hampton Roads,
Gateway Bank and Shore Bank. Both Shore and Gateway were acquired in 2008. The
acquisition of Gateway Financial (former ticker GBTS), which closed in December 2008,
was supposed to be a transformational acquisition. Before being acquired, Gateway
suffered losses in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred shares that created a capital
hole earlier in 2008.
Prior to a capital raise, HMPR swooped in with $100 million offer to buy GBTS. The much
smaller HMPR (with only $845 million of assets) acquired the much larger Gateway ($2.1
billion in assets). The combined HMPR ended 2008 with over $3 billion in assets and $211
million in common equity. The acquisition caused some controversy at the time because
HMPR "used part of the $80.3 million received from the Treasury" under TARP program to
fund the acquisition and pay "Gateway's senior executives significant retention bonuses."
Ironically, a few months later HMPR's then CEO complained, "We've learned to live in the
world of TARP, including the restrictions on compensation." In another ironic and
frightening twist (to the US taxpayer), just a few months later, HMPR defaulted on its
TARP dividend payment.
The acquisitions turned about to be a disaster for HMPR. Less than three months after the
acquisition, Gateway's credit blew up. The following quarter, credit at the legacy HMPR
dramatically deteriorated. The destruction of capital was incredible, even for that painful
part of the financial cycle. From December 2008 to December 2009, HMPR had blown
through its entire $211 million of common equity and actually had negative equity exiting
2009. By mid-2010, private equity investors were scrambling to invest the massive funds
they had raised to recapitalize U.S. banks.

Despite HMPR's disastrous credit and capital profile, a group of private equity investors
recapitalized the company at $10 per share. The US Treasury agreed to convert TARP
into common equity at the same price, accepting a nearly $60 million haircut on TARP (a
74% loss on paper). The loss to the Treasury (U.S. taxpayer) was painful, but Treasury
would have faced a total loss had HMPR been taken over by the FDIC.
In total, HMPR raised $295 million of equity in the second half of 2010. As a frame of
reference, its peak equity market capitalization after the Gateway acquisition (when the
outlook was very bright) was only $207 million, 30% less than the equity raised in the
second half of 2010 alone. Based on the unusual short-term dislocation from the Russell
2000 reconstitution, HMPR's market cap has actually ballooned to $650 million today.
Capital and Credit Very Questionable Despite 2010's Massively Dilutive Cap Raise
After suffering an additional $66 million of losses in the two quarters following its equity
recapitalization, HMPR once again finds itself in a very precarious capital position. HMPR
currently has a 5.52% TCE ratio, a 6.34% leverage ratio, and a 10.73% risk-based capital
ratio. While these are technically still above some regulatory hurdles, they are far below
other healthy banks, and significantly below typical requirements established in regulatory
agreements. Many MOUs require 9% leverage ratios and 12% to 13% RBC ratios. Based
on our analysis, HMPR would have to raise $35 million to $100 million of common equity
to attain those levels and may need more to provide cushion for future losses.
As tenuous as the issues appear with the thin capital position, the credit profile is even
direr. At March 31, HMPR had $304 million of non-performing assets, including troubled
debt restructurings. This represents a whopping 16.2% of loans and REO and 11.2% of
total assets. A screen of U.S. banks with greater than $75 million market cap examining
NPAs to tangible capital plus reserves shows HMPR has the fourth-lowest ratio in the
country. This suggests that HMPR is not carrying sufficient reserves or capital. The three
other banks that screened worse than HMPR (two of which or Puerto Rican banks),
currently trade at 16% to 45% of book value (nearly a 10x discount to HMPR).

So given the woeful financial profile of HMPR, why have the shares gone parabolic? On
April 27, HMPR executed a 1 for 25 reverse stock split. This reverse stock split was

actually out of desperation, allowing the company to regain compliance with Nasdaq listing
requirements (May 12 press release). Amazingly, the reverse merger listing qualified
HMPR for inclusion into the Russell 2000. The significant number of shares that were
required to be purchased by index investors, combined with the small float (at least today),
has driven the stock price to levels that we believe are unsustainable. 
HMPR: Significantly Worse Credit and Capital at 4x the Price of Its Peers
For comparison purposes, we wanted to highlight two other banks with similar
characteristics and asset sizes to HMPR (but trade as a massive valuation discrepancy).
All three of these banks have recently completed sizable capital raises following credit and
regulatory issues. Additionally, all three of the banks below have sizable valuation
allowances against their deferred tax assets. Central Pacific Bank (NYSE:CPF) completed
a $325 million equity raise in February 2011 with the same investors that led HMPR's
capital raise at $10 per share. Similar to the HMPR deal, the U.S. Treasury converted its
TARP to equity at $10 per share in conjunction with the raise. Wilshire Bancorp (WIBC)
also recently completed a $100 million equity raise following a recent regulatory exam.

As the table above highlights, CPF and WIBC appear far more attractive from a credit and
capital standpoint, but trade at an inexplicable discount to HMPR. The only area where
HMPR appears favorable relative to CPF and WIBC is with its valuation allowance against
its deferred tax assets. We wonder if some investors mistakenly view this as a hidden
asset. After a change in control, there are significant restrictions of the use of NOLs. As of
today, 97.3% of HMPR's shares outstanding were issued at $10 in the second half of
2010, clearly triggering a change in control. HMPR appears to agree, stating in its most
recent 10-q that "section 382 limitations related to the capital raised during the quarters
ended September 30, 2010 and December 31, 2010 add further uncertainty to the
realizability of the deferred tax assets in future periods."
Given the massive valuation, one would assume that HMPR possessed solid earnings
power. However, this does not appear to be the case. When excluding all credit costs (so
provision and losses on REO) and other one time expenses (like FDIC charges), HMPR
still had negative "pre-tax, pre-provision" earnings the past two quarters. Even if investors
think HMPR can shrink into its capital base (closer to at 8% TCE at $1.9 billion assets)
and generate a very optimistic 1.1% return of assets, these assumptions would only
generate a measly $0.60 of earnings power at its current share count. Applying a
benevolent multiple of 12x (in a world of single-digit multiple for banks) to this generous
earnings scenario, HMPR's stock price would be fundamentally valued at $7.35 per share.
So Why Could the Collapse be Imminent?  
The clock appears to be ticking with the Russell reconstitution scheduled to occur on June
24. The additions and deletions have already been publically announced. Many index
funds, active traders, and quant funds begin accumulating shares of stocks to be added
prior to the "official" announcement. To be added to the Russell Index, an objective market
cap cut-off is used that can be determined by many traders.
What can not be easily identified is how the Russell Selection Team will determine
weightings, which are based on "float adjusted market cap." Russell excludes shares
owned by the government and board members in its "float adjusted market cap" definition.
We believe it is likely that indexers and traders may have materially overestimated the
number of HMPR shares that needed to be acquired. As a result, we expect very little

impact on HMPR's shares on June 24, and could in fact see large amounts of shares that
need to be sold by overzealous traders into a potential vacuum of bids.
Second, we believe it is likely that the US Treasury will take advantage of the dislocation
(before the shares collapse) and sell its roughly 2.1 million shares. In fact, as US tax
payers, we implore the Treasury to sell its shares ASAP to minimize the losses associated
with our money. At conversion in the fourth quarter 2010, the Treasury agreed to take a
74% loss on TARP.
With the artificial move in the stock price, the loss today has decline to around 50%. We
fear this 50% loss may be the best case scenario for the Treasury. If HMRP trades to our
price target (around $4.48), this represent a greater than 90% loss. The Treasury recently
sold its AIG position, and on June 15, announced plans to sell its CPF shares (see table
above). CPF had the exact same lead investors as HMPR, and in both instances the
Treasury converted TARP to common shares at $10 per share. The U.S. Treasury will
recognize a 20% to 25% gain from the 5.6 million shares of CPF that it converted in
February 2011.
As seen from the table above, CPF compares very favorably to HMPR with most
important financial metrics (including reserve coverage, credit and capital). Given the fact
the Treasury appears willing to sell its CPF stake at 1.3x to 1.4x book value; we think it is
reasonable to assume the Treasury will jump at the chance to sell its massive HMPR
stake at over 4x book if given the chance. The capital position of HMPR has only
deteriorated since the Treasury converted TARP to HMPR equity at $10 per share. As a
result, we think it is likely that the Treasury floods the market with its shares soon.
Finally, we believe management realizes its valuation is unsustainable (and that it needs
capital). Just four days after they were added to the Russell list of Index additions, the
company announced a 5 million share "at the market" equity offering (June 14). We
believe the company is going to try to flood the market with shares to take advantage of
the massive valuation before the temporary Russell demand vanishes and the stock price
heads back to the levels it was at a month ago ($11.50 per share). Who can blame it?
We believe management has strong incentive to issue shares anywhere above tangible
book value (so $4.48 per share). We find it hard to believe that any new investor would be
willing to infuse fresh capital into this bank at or above this level. The best outcome in our
opinion would be if HMPR's investor group is willing to continue to fund the company at
$10 per share--inline with their previous investment. This is still almost 50% below the
current price and may represent the best outcome for current investors.
In early 2009, HMPR's peak equity market capitalization after the acquisition was only
$207 million. This was a time when credit was pristine and the bank was viewed as a high
