RE-UP FROM 2019: A HAZY SHADE OF


WINTER – PART 1 (TYME)


[This post contains thoughts about Tyme Technologies (TYME) from January 2019. Due to recent
events, and its transformation from Cancercrapper to Coronacrapper it seems appropriate to re-
examine it now, two years later. Fans of biocrap will recognize several names from fellow
Coronacrapper Relief Therapeutics (RLFTF) as well.]


Back in March 2012 a wretched Siesta Key, FL shell company called Global Group Enterprises
(GGET) was born out of the offices of Diane J. Harrison.

Diane is well known among fans of small cap stock scams, and to the SEC. She has the rare honor
of being one of the few lawyers ever chastised for their role in aiding, abetting, and perpetrating
stock frauds.


The SEC’s complaint alleges that attorney Diane J. Harrison, Esq. and her husband, Michael
J. Daniels, both of Palmetto, Florida, manufactured at least five microcap issuers with the
undisclosed intent to sell them based on their status as public companies with purportedly
unrestricted shares available for resale in the public markets. According to the complaint,
Daniels and Harrison created the false appearance that the companies were pursuing
specific business plans with independent management and shareholders by installing

friends and family (including defendant Catherine A. Bradaick-Zolla of Sarasota, Florida,
who also provided other assistance to the fraud) as purported officers and shareholders.


and that’s not all:


The SEC’s complaint also alleges that Harrison participated in a separate fraudulent
scheme involving at least 11 undisclosed blank check companies secretly controlled by
Alvin S. Mirman and Sheldon R. Rose. The SEC previously filed enforcement actions against
Mirman and Rose, who were also convicted of criminal charges and sentenced to prison
based on the same alleged conduct. According to the SEC’s complaint, Harrison provided
at least 21 false legal opinion letters in furtherance of Mirman and Rose’s scheme.


Read the full complaint here.


The shell was ostensibly run by Andrew Keck, whose wife, Sarah Keck, ran another Harrison scam,
Neutra Corp (NTRR).


Not long after, in February 2013, control of the shell was bought by Ed Tobin, Christopher Brown
and the fine folks at GEM Advisors (aka Global Emerging Markets aka GEM Group etc.) in NYC.
Only now, the company has moved from one dirty lawyer, to another.


Yes, our good friend, and ex-convict, Adam S. Gottbetter. Readers might recall his Very Bad Day.


Fast forward to 2015, and the GGET shell merges with a private bioturd, creating TYME. Naturally
there is a press release to trumpet the good news. Perhaps the contact name will ring a bell?

Indeed, it’s the Big Ram himself, part of any sell side whore dream team. Most famous for his
relentless shilling of Ampio (AMPE).


Funny that his resume doesn’t show his moonlighting:


Nor does his CRD:

Or does it? It turns out Rags was fired from not one, but two, bucket shops for failing to disclose
his lucrative side business!


FIRM DISCOVERED THAT INDIVIDUAL APPARENTLY HAS BEEN ACTING AS THE INVESTOR
RELATIONS CONTACT FOR A PUBLIC COMPANY IN COMPENSATION FOR WHICH HE HAD
RECEIVED SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IN THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH CASH PAYMENTS.
NEITHER THE IR ROLE NOR OWNERSHIP OF THE SHARES AND CASH PAYMENTS
WERE DISCLOSED TO THE FIRM


Read the full CRD here to learn more.


Just how lucrative? How about 250,000 shares and over $8k a month, for a part-time gig hyping
reverse merger trash.
