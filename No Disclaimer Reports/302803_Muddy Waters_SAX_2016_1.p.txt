Ströer: Blue Sky or Being Taken for a Ride? 
 
Muddy Waters Capital LLC (“Muddy Waters”) is an investment advisor to a private fund. 
Muddy Waters has analyzed the German listed stock corporation Ströer SE Co. & KGaA 
(together with its predecessor legal entities, “Ströer”) and is hereby publishing the outcome and 
the conclusions of our analysis, which is based on publicly available information.  The fund 
Muddy Waters manages is short in Ströer and for this reason there might be a conflict of interest.

Introduction 
 
Ströer went public in 2010 as a Germany-based operator of billboards, with the founders Dirk 
Ströer and Udo Müller floating 47.8% of the company’s shares – they still hold about 42% of the 
shares today.  The business was steadily growing, but perhaps a bit boring.  The stock price 
languished.  At the end of 2012, it was down 40% from its IPO, and trading at 7x EV / EBITDA.  
But something big changed in 2013.  Ströer unveiled a “digital” strategy based on three pillars – 
acquiring a group of online businesses in Turkey and Poland, buying a couple of online ad 
exchanges, and buying a few online advertising businesses from Dirk Ströer and Udo Müller, 
who is still the CEO of Ströer.  This all seemed to make sense – old world advertising meeting 
the new, Ströer striving to become number one in Germany in online and offline, a bold 
company that grasped what others weren’t yet seeing… 
 
Most of the world seems to think Ströer’s move into online has been a smashing success.  
Revenues, EBITDA, and net income are all up substantially since the end of 2012 – and not 
coincidentally – so is the stock price.  At around €54 per share, Ströer now trades at 19.77x EV / 
EBITDA.  The company promises an even more exciting future that includes neat things like 
beacons, and it gives us cool graphics like the one below to show us what’s coming –  
 


Page 2 of 62
Ströer has since acquired content companies, Deutsche Telekom’s online portal, an education 
software company, mobile advertising companies, a statistical analysis company, gaming 
companies, a company aiming to make the yellow pages obsolete, and a location-based 
advertising firm.  Since 2012, Ströer has bought stakes in at least 29 companies, spending what 
we calculate is €142 million in cash, and increasing the share count by 32%.1  Ströer says its 
digital businesses grew organically by 34.3% in 2014, and 23.5% in 2015.  Why should anybody 
be skeptical?   
 
Well, it turns out that Ströer’s claimed digital organic growth rates are way off from what we can 
calculate.  We see Digital organic growth rates of only 2.2% in 2014, and 2.5% (using 
adjustments we believe are more reflective of the business) to 16.4% (using the company’s 
methodology) in 2015.  Maybe Ströer’s digital foray makes as much sense as wanting to be 
sucked into your computer in order to get physical media implants.  The billboard business 
strikes us as a real estate business.  It is our view that much of the business revolves around 
knowing commuting patterns and neighborhood demographics, dealing with planning 
departments, negotiating leases with property owners, schmoozing with government employees, 
managing construction, securing adequate insurance, detecting structural problems and managing 
maintenance, working with industrial printers, managing logistics, etc., etc.  Billboards seem to 
us like a fairly old school, hard-nosed business. 
 
Perhaps there’s a good reason why Ströer seems unique among OOH advertising companies in 
aggressively pursuing online business.  Why is it that large U.S. OOH companies with relatively 
easy access to Silicon Valley seemingly haven’t caught onto Ströer’s opportunity set?  Probably 
for the same reason Sergei Brin, Larry Page, Jerry Yang, and Mark Zuckerberg were not in 
commercial real estate before founding online marketing powerhouses – there seems to be little 
overlap.   


                                                
1 The cash total includes €19.4 million for acquiring non-controlling interests. 


Page 3 of 62
When we scratch the surface at Ströer, we see a company that to us appears far less successful in 
online than the market seems to think.  Moreover, we see a company whose insiders have spun a 
great story, but with seemingly little substance; and, while telling the story, have engaged in 
more highly questionable self-dealing than we’ve ever seen outside of a Chinese company.  
That’s why we’re short Ströer.      
 
Summary 
 
Ströer SE Co. & KGaA (“Ströer”) is not the company the market seems to think it is.  We 
believe organic growth, EBITDA, operating cash flow, and free cash flow to be significantly 
lower than Ströer reports.  These items go right to the heart of the investment case for Ströer.  
We have serious concerns about Ströer’s governance, and these concerns are inextricably linked 
to our views on the company’s profitability and cash flows.   
 
Ströer’s governance reminds us of some of the companies we researched in China.  In one 
instance, Ströer agreed to buy a company from insiders before the insiders themselves even 
purchased it.  Because of the way the transaction was structured, it is impossible to say how 
much profit the insiders made; however, we believe approximately €22.4 million on a €2 million 
cash investment made just six months earlier is a reasonable estimate.  Insider-affiliated 
companies are both users and suppliers of Ströer OOH advertising locations, which we think is 
inappropriate; and, further causes us to be concerned about whether sufficient internal controls 
exist.   
 
We have identified an instance in which a once key digital acquisition went bad, and to our 
mind, the company and management seem to have avoided being held accountable.  Perhaps it is 
then not surprising to read the remarks that a senior Ströer executive made publicly about the 
company’s approach to buying digital businesses – in our opinion, his comments show a highly 
cavalier attitude toward capital allocation.   
 
Insiders have sold hundreds of millions of euro worth of stock, and even failed to properly report 
some of their share transactions – possibly in violation of the law.  We believe that since Ströer 
embarked on its digital strategy in 2013, its board of supervisors has generally lacked sufficient 
independence, which has helped to create the conditions giving rise to the aforementioned issues, 
as well as other issues we discuss in this report. 
 
We believe that Ströer has substantially overstated its organic growth figures in 2014 and 2015.  
We do not know if what we believe to be the overstatements result from incompetence or are an 
attempt to mislead investors.  In our view, the most accurate way of measuring Digital organic 
growth in 2015 would have yielded a rate of only 2.5%.   
 
We adjust Ströer’s 2015 free cash flow down by a) €24.8 million due to our inability to reconcile 
certain balance sheet and cash flow statement accounts, which causes us concern about Ströer’s 
accounts, and b) €26.9 million of purchases of non-controlling interests.  We adjust Ströer’s 
2015 operating cash flow downward because we suspect the company greatly stretched its 
payables (in terms of days sales) to 118 days, versus a three-year average of 95 days.  We believe 


Page 4 of 62
Ströer artificially inflates EBITDA through other operating income, and certain capitalized items 
that we suspect are more conservatively expensed.   
 
Ströer’s year-end cash flow statements wrongly show that Ströer had no borrowings during the 
year.  However, Ströer’s annual statement cash flow statement only shows borrowing activity net 
of repayments, rather than gross.  This appears to violate IFRS, and gives the incorrect 
appearance Ströer is able to fund itself through cash flow and cash on hand throughout the year.  
In our opinion, Ströer’s auditor has committed a clear error in allowing for the misleading 
presentation in the annual cash flow statement.   
 
Ströer’s public video operation, Infoscreen, seems to be an outlier in the industry in terms of its 
profitability.  Since its reclassification to the Digital segment in 2015, Infoscreen has been 
integral to the Ströer growth story.  We believe Infoscreen deserves greater scrutiny from 
investors. 
 
As a result of the foregoing factors, we find the investment case for Ströer hollow.

I.  Organic Growth in Digital and Overall Appear to be Greatly Overstated 
 
We believe that Ströer has substantially overstated its organic growth figures in 2014 and 2015.  
We do not know if what we believe to be the overstatements result from incompetence or are an 
attempt to mislead investors.  Below are the organic growth figures we calculated from the 
information the company released.  We use the same formula Ströer used in each year, and we 
made no adjustments to methodology.  (We explain the misleading way Ströer calculates the 
base year for its 2015 organic growth calculation.  When we adjust Ströer’s base year, 2015 
organic growth is even lower.) 
 


Page 6 of 62
Below is our reconciliation of 2014 and 2015 organic growth.  
 








The impossibility of Ströer’s claimed 2014 overall organic growth rate of 11.4% is laid bare by 
the inconsistency in a single paragraph of its 2014 AR.  In that paragraph, Ströer reiterates that 
its organic growth in 2014 was 11.4%; however, it also states that its inorganic growth was 
€42.2 million.2  As shown in the tables below, it would have been impossible in 2014 for Ströer 
to have grown organically by 11.4%, and inorganically by €42.2 million. 
 
Taking 11.4% organic growth as a given, trying to reconcile to €42.2 million inorganic growth:

Page 7 of 62
Ströer’s 2015 Organic Growth Should be Adjusted even Lower 
 
In our view, the most accurate way of measuring Digital organic growth in 2015 would have 
yielded a rate of only 2.5%.  First, Ströer misleads regarding its 2015 organic growth rate by 
“cherry picking”.  (“Cherry picking” is the practice of excluding poor individual results when 
calculating overall performance.)  Without this selective exclusion, 2015 Digital organic growth 
would have been only 11.8%, and 2015 overall organic growth would have been only 7.6%.  
Second, Ströer made its Digital segment appear to be growing 3.9 percentage points faster by 
reclassifying public video as digital in 2015.  We argue this is disingenuous.  Third, Ströer 
changed its organic growth calculation methodology in 2015 to include organic growth of 
companies it acquired in 2015, which increased Digital organic growth by 2.6 percentage points 
and overall organic growth by 0.9 percentage points.  We believe that including organic growth 
of acquisitions in the year of the acquisition is a perversion of what “organic growth” means.   
 
In 2015, Ströer disposed of a group of companies that, per the below slide, contributed revenue 
in 2014 of €7.2 million.3  These companies were disposed of for near zero consideration – even 
though at least one of them had profits implying it was worth at least a few million euros.4  As 
shown in the below slide, when Ströer calculated 2015 organic growth it adjusted downward the 
2014 revenue base by the €7.2 million revenue it disposed of in 2015. 
 
Disposing of companies for zero consideration is effectively a management failure.  If the 
purpose of organic growth is to gauge the effectiveness of management’s strategy, then organic 
growth should not benefit from such failures.  That is even truer when Ströer dubiously includes 
organic growth it acquires in its calculations (discussed infra).

Accountability at Ströer’ 


Page 8 of 62
Second, Ströer made its digital segment appear to be growing much faster by reclassifying public 
video as digital in 2015.  We argue that move is disingenuous because, unlike the rest of the 
Digital segment, public video is not accessed over computers or mobile devices – it’s just 
another version of a billboard.  Ströer management is likely aware that the market puts a higher 
multiple on its Digital segment (especially if growing quickly) than on OOH.  Changing nothing 
else about Ströer’s methodology, reclassifying public video boosted the Digital organic growth 
rate from 11.7% to 15.6%.5  If we also disallow the “cherry picking” adjustment, then the 
reclassification increased Digital organic growth from 7.1% to 11.8%.   
 
Third, Ströer changed its organic growth calculation methodology in 2015 to include organic 
growth of companies it acquired in 2015.  As we explain infra, we believe that including organic 
growth of acquisitions in the year of the acquisition is a perversion of what “organic growth” 
means.  This change alone boosted Digital’s growth rate (all other aspects of Ströer’s formula 
kept unchanged) from 9.2% to 11.8%.  It boosted Ströer’s overall organic growth rate from 6.7% 
to 7.6%.   
 
If we adjust Ströer’s 2015 organic growth formula to i) eliminate the cherry picking adjustment 
Ströer made, ii) reverse the reclassification of public video as Digital, and iii) use the 2014 
organic growth calculation methodology, which excludes acquired organic growth, then Ströer’s 
2015 Digital organic growth rate would have been only 2.5%.  
 
Why Ströer Should not Include Acquired Organic Growth in “Organic Growth” 
In 2015, Ströer changed the methodology by which it claims to calculate organic growth.  Under 
the new methodology, when Ströer acquires a company that is growing YoY, Ströer starts 
                                                
5 We use the 15.6% rate in lieu of the company’s disclosed 23.5% rate for reasons that should be obvious. 


Page 9 of 62
counting the acquired growth as its own “organic” growth beginning the first day of Ströer’s 
ownership.  We suppose it’s a sign of the times that Ströer has been able to get away with this 
concept, which is almost entirely opposite of what “organic growth” is supposed to mean.  Being 
able to acquire “organic growth” is antithetical to the concept of measuring organic growth.  
Organic growth is supposed to tell investors how much growth a business has generated without 
investment in expansion.  All other things being equal, the faster a company grows organically, 
the greater its FCF is. 
 
There are two additional Ströer twists to its computation of “organic growth” (aside from the fact 
its computations appear to be wrong).  First, it is relatively easy to game this version of “organic 
growth” by acquiring companies a few months into the year when there is very high visibility 
into the performance for the rest of the year.  As far as we can tell, the voodoo of online business 
has prevented any sell-side analysts from trying to assess whether the prices Ströer is paying 
really make sense.  
 
Second, Ströer’s use of this form of “organic growth” as a KPI for investors and internal 
compensation purposes creates conditions for “spring loading”.  “Spring loading” in M&A is 
when an acquirer induces its acquisition target to manage its results in the period before the 
acquisition is completed.  At the behest of the acquirer, targets can engage in a combination of 
deferring revenue and cash flows until after the acquisition is completed, or moving forward the 
recognition of expenses and payments to occur before the acquisition date – when they otherwise 
would have occurred afterward.6  We do not have any evidence Ströer engages in spring loading 
– more disclosure into the pre- and post-acquisition performance of acquired companies would 
be needed to form an opinion either way.   
 
The below definition of “organic growth” from Nasdaq clearly conflicts with the concept Ströer 
is pushing on investors.  
 


“Organic growth” Refers to growth achieved by internal investments of the firm. This 
could be the day-to-day business of the firm or a division of the firm starting a new 
business from scratch. This is distinguished from growth by acquisition or merger which 
involves an outside firm.7 
 


Investopedia’s definition gives even more detail. 
 


Organic growth is the growth rate that a company can achieve by increasing output and 
enhancing sales. This excludes any profits or growth acquired 
from takeovers, acquisitions or mergers. Takeovers, acquisitions and mergers do not 
bring about profits generated within the company, and are therefore not considered 
organic. Organic growth represents the true growth for the core of the company. It is a 
good indicator of how well management has used its internal resources to expand profits. 


                                                
6 For a comprehensive academic discussion of spring loading, see: 
http://faculty.som.yale.edu/jakethomas/papers/quietperiodEM.pdf 
7 http://www.nasdaq.com/investing/glossary/o/organic-growth 


Page 10 of 62
Organic growth also identifies whether managers have used their skills to improve the 
business.8 
 


In a highly dysfunctional company that uses Ströer’s definition of “organic growth” as a KPI for 
investors and compensation, we can envisage a scenario in which management makes a number 
of acquisitions primarily for the purpose of hitting “organic growth” targets, and in which the 
businesses generally do not fit well with the existing business.  If the acquired businesses do not 
continue to grow at high rates, which are particularly a risk when acquisitions are spring loaded, 
management is faced with a choice between letting the “organic growth” rate collapse, or buying 
even more companies.  The danger to investors in such a company is that every buy growth at all 
costs scheme comes to the point at which it hits the wall, and cannot be sustained.   
 
Generally speaking, managements will not expressly tell investors if they (the management) are 
pursuing a short term, buy growth at all costs strategy.  Investors have to look for signs.  We 
think there are plenty with Ströer. 
 
II.  Ströer Appears to Artificially Inflate EBITDA 
 
We believe investors should adjust downward Ströer’s reported EBITDA as shown in the table 
below.  The adjustments we feel are warranted relate to Ströer’s other operating income, and 
certain capitalized items that we suspect are more conservatively expensed.   
 





We suspect that Ströer’s Other Operating Income (included in EBITDA) includes amounts that 
are one off or non-recurring.  We start by adjusting 2014 EBITDA down by €6.8 million to 
€127.2 million.  The adjustment is to remove income booked that “relates to compensation 
payments received in connection with acquired advertising concessions within the Ströer 
Germany segment which could not be used to the extent agreed.”9   
 
We hold steady that number, our 2014 adjusted Other Operating Income, constant in 2015.  
(Reported Other Operating Income grew versus our 2014 adjusted number by 30%.  Because we 
found no disclosure explaining this growth, we think it prudent to adjust by neutralizing the 
growth, and use €12 million - €18million as normalized 2015 Other Operating Income.) 
 
We adjust 2015 EBITDA for what appears to us to be outsize growth in the Rights and Royalties 
line in Intangible Assets.  We suspect that some portion of this increase would be more 
conservatively expensed.  In 2015, the gross increase of Rights and Royalties was €46.3 million, 


                                                
8 http://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/organicgrowth.asp 
9 Ströer 2014 AR p125 


Page 11 of 62
which concerns us because the gross increase in 2014 was only €10.8 million.  Because little 
disclosure is provided on Rights and Royalties in 2015, we adjust EBITDA downward in a range 
from 25% to 75% of the delta between 2014 and 2015 gross increase in intangibles.   This 
adjustment reduces our 2015 EBITDA calculation by €8.9 million to €26.6 million. 
 


 
 
To be clear, our adjustments would benefit from greater disclosure about these line items.  Our 
belief that it is prudent to make these downward adjustments is influenced by our perception that 
Ströer seems to seek opportunities to engineer its financials – i.e., we believe the entire body of 
facts should result in Ströer being given the burden of the doubt.   
 
III.  We Adjust Operating Cash Flow Downward  
 
Outside of the EBITDA adjustments, we adjust 2015 Operating Cash Flow downward by €45.4 
million.  Our adjustment is to counterbalance a blowout in 2015 payables, which causes us to 
believe Ströer could have been stretching its payables.  The three-year average during 2012 to 
2014 of payables divided by days sales is 95 days.10 
 





Adjusting payables to 95 days decreases OCF by €45.4 million.  Our adjustment would benefit 
from greater disclosure about the increase in payables.   
 
IV.  We Adjust 2015 FCF Downward by €51.7 million (-33.1%), and Discuss Our Concerns 
About Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Statement Accounts11 
 
                                                
10 Inputs from Ströer 2013 – 2014 Annual Reports. 
11 Levered Free Cash Flow of €156.2 – source S&P Capital IQ. 


Page 12 of 62
We adjust Ströer’s 2015 free cash flow down by a) €24.8 million due to our inability to reconcile 
certain balance sheet and cash flow statement accounts, and b) €26.9 million of purchases of 
non-controlling interests.   
 
As we make clear throughout this report, we have significant concerns about aspects of Ströer’s 
accounting.  We are unable to reconcile certain balance sheet and cash flow statement accounts.  
The balance sheet accounts show additions that are €24.8 million greater than what the cash flow 
statement seems to show.  We therefore adjust free cash lower by €24.8 million.  
 
In 2015 Ströer reported additions on its balance sheet of a) €46.3 million in Rights and Royalties, 
b) €4.8 million in Prepayments, and c) €7.9 million in Development costs.12   
 


 
 
Ströer also reports additions in balance sheet accounts of €35.4 million in Other Plant & 
Equipment and €13.6 million in Prepayments Made and Assets Under Construction.13

13 Ströer 2015 Annual Report p. 137 


Page 13 of 62
Therefore, the total additions to Intangible Assets and PP&E in 2015 in the balance sheet 
accounts was €108 million.  However, on the cash flow statement we can only see €76.3 million 
of Cash Paid for Investments in Intangible Assets and Property Plant and Equipment.14  
 


 
 
In Note 33 of the 2015 AR we can see that “non cash transaction that led to an increase in non-
current assets” accounted for €6.9 million; but, this still leaves with a balance of €24.8 million 
that cannot be reconciled.15  In the absence of explanation, we therefore adjust free cash flow 
downward by this delta.  We also think this is a very concerning sign about Ströer’s accounts. 
 


 
 
Our final adjustment to free cash flow is to account for Ströer’s buyout of non-controlling 
interests. Ströer currently books cash paid to minority interests (in companies it has acquired as 
part of its roll-up strategy) as “Cash flows from financing activity”.  While this is technically

Page 14 of 62
proper under IFRS, we believe it is misleading in Ströer’s case.  Ströer repeatedly acquires 
companies in increments after purchasing the initial controlling stake. We therefore believe that 
in spirit, these outflows should be investing outflows, and therefore we deduct them from free 
cash flow.  In this way, we adjust 2015 free cash flow downward by another €26.9 million. 16   
 


 
 
 
V.  Digital Segment Operational EBITDA in 2015 Appears Overstated; Operational 
EBITDA Growth in 2014 and 2015 Seems to us Low Quality 
 
When Ströer reclassified Public Video into the Digital segment in 2015, it appears not to have 
correspondingly carried over into Digital €5.4 million expenses that used to be attributed to 
Public Video.  Instead, those expenses appear to have been reclassified in 2015 as non-operating 
segment expenses.  This seemingly selective reclassification boosted Digital Operational 
EBITDA and combined Operational EBITDA. 
 
Ströer restated 2014 Operational EBITDA to reflect the reclassification, which increased by €5.4 
million upon reclassification.  As shown in the table below, that increase came from increasing 
the expenses allocated to non-operating.  We find it highly questionable that expenses that were 
previously operating are now non-operating. 
 
The table below shows the sources of much of the rest of the growth in 2014 and 2015 
Operational EBITDA.  These appear to us to be questionable and / or non-recurring sources.

unsustainable.

VI.  Cash Flow Statement Shenanigans Appear to Disguise Cash Flow Needs, and Indicates

19 This appears to mainly be from T-online EBITDA. “Basically, for these, we acquired, as you know, on the 2nd of 


November. We acquired the companies, so we had 2 months, November and December. And for the 2 months, 
basically, the contribution was, in terms of revenues, more than EUR 25 million, and in terms of EBITDA, it was 
more than EUR 10 million, between EUR 10 million and EUR 15 million.” - 2015Q4 transcript in 2016/2 


20 IFRS 8 Operating Segments, para 6: 
Not every part of an entity is necessarily an operating segment or part of an operating segment. For example, a 
corporate headquarters or some functional departments may not earn revenues or may earn revenues that are only 
incidental to the activities of the entity and would not be operating segments. For the purposes of this IFRS, an 
entity’s post-employment benefit plans are not operating segments.

Ströer’s year-end cash flow statements wrongly show that Ströer had no borrowings during the 
year.  In fact, Ströer draws down tens of millions euro on its credit facility each of the first three 
quarters of the year, which it then repays before the end of the quarter.  However, Ströer’s annual 
statement cash flow statement only shows borrowing activity net of repayments, rather than 
gross.  This gives the incorrect appearance Ströer is able to fund itself through cash flow and 
cash on hand throughout the year.   
 
In our opinion, Ströer’s auditor has committed a clear error.  IFRS is clear that Ströer’s 
borrowing activity should be shown gross.21  Even though we have had front row seats to some 
of the most spectacular auditor failures of this decade, we are still stunned that Ernst & Young 
has overlooked this basic and obvious problem in Ströer’s cash flow.   
 
Working off of Ströer’s interim cash flow statements, we can calculate that Ströer borrowed and 
repaid the below amounts.  The heavy borrowings in Q’s 1-3 show that Ströer was likely 
consuming cash most of the year.

VII.  Switching to Gross Revenue Recognition Obscures Real Revenue 
 
Ströer accounts for its digital revenue on a gross basis, which gives a misleading picture of the 
growth that occurred as Ströer transitioned away from being an OOH-only company.  Ströer first 
disclosed its gross revenue recognition policy in its digital advertising business in 2014.22  We 
are under the impression that a significant portion of Ströer’s digital business involves acting as 
an advertising agent for third party owned websites.  We understand that digital agencies 
generally keep only approximately 30% of the advertising revenue paid.  Ströer does not 
disclose, or otherwise make it possible to determine, what its payments to content owners are.   
 
Particularly given the overall body of facts, it is difficult for us to think of this accounting 
practice as anything other than a venal move to create the impression the company is larger than 
it actually is.  (We note that many Internet businesses are valued on revenue multiples.) 
 
Ströer Digital Group (freeXmedia, Ströer Interactive and Business Advertising), in our opinion, 
is probably an example of how the change to gross can make the top line appear much larger.23 
We suspect a change to gross revenue recognition is the reason for the large increase in post-
acquisition revenue (€36 million in 2012 growing to €48 million in 2013). 24   SDG’s EBITDA 
did not materially increase, and we note that it owns no more than 10% of its online advertising 
inventory.25 
 
Revenues in 1H 2013 for Media Ventures’s online marketing segment would have been flat were 
it not for the acquisition of freeXmedia, and 2012 sales were down 7.7% compared to 2011. 26,27 
freeXmedia reported revenue of €6 million in 2012 and expected a 4.2% drop in revenue in 2013 
due to the loss of two large publishers.28 Put simply, these businesses seem stagnant at best at the 
time, and Ströer offered no post facto explanation as to how 2013 revenue improved so 
dramatically in the seven post-acquisition months. The best explanation we can think of is that 
the post-acquisition revenue boost is due to a change from net to gross revenue recognition 
policy.

Business Advertising, and €6 million reported by freenet for freeXmedia (Media Ventures 2012 Annual Report; 
freenet 2012 Annual Report). Pre-acquisition revenue for these three companies is €18 million (Media Ventures

Muddy Waters established itself by exposing fraud in Chinese companies.  It’s rare that we see 
something in the west that parallels the governance standards we’ve witnessed in China.  
However, the facts surrounding Media Ventures GmbH, and its flip of a company called 
freeXmedia GmbH (“freeXmedia”) to Ströer take us back to a company called Focus Media 
Holdings, Inc. (“FMCN”) and its chairman, Jiang Nanchun.  (The Allyes affair, in which we see 
some parallels to Ströer / freeXmedia, led FMCN and Jiang to agree in September 2015 to settle 
with the SEC for $55.6 million.29) 
 
Media Ventures is owned 49% by Udo Muller and 51% by Dirk Ströer.30,31,32  Ströer’s dealings 
with Media Ventures over freeXmedia make us concerned that insiders’ ulterior motives are 
significant factors in Ströer’s digital strategy.  The original seller of freeXmedia was freenet AG 
(“freenet”).  The transaction timeline was as follows: 
 


• 29 November 2012: Ströer’s supervisory board met and discussed acquiring freeXmedia, 
which was owned at the time by freenet.33 


• 4 December 2012: Media Ventures – note, not Ströer – agreed to buy freeXmedia from 
freenet. The reported purchase price was €4.08 million.34  


• 16 December 2012: Ströer Media publicly announced its preliminary agreement to 
acquire freeXmedia from Media Ventures GmbH.35 


• 1 January 2013: Media Ventures’s purchase of freeXmedia from freenet closed.36 
• January – March 2013: Media Ventures merged freeXmedia, Ströer Interactive, and its 


50.4% stake in Business Advertising GmbH (“Business Advertising”), into Ströer 
Interactive group (“SIG”), although it doesn’t appear to have been a formal corporate 
entity.37 


• 3 June 2013: Ströer finalized the acquisition of SIG for €49.5 million, plus an earn-out of 
up to €9.85 million. 38,39,40  Part of the consideration was paid with 6.77 million shares, 
each valued at the time at €7.31.41,42  The three companies comprising SIG were later 
merged to form Ströer Digital Group GmbH.43 


 
The timeline above is clearly problematic because it seems Ströer almost certainly could have 
bought freeXmedia directly from freenet, and separately purchased Ströer Interactive and

Business Advertising from Media Ventures.  One reasonable conclusion from the above facts is 
that by having Media Ventures act as an intermediary, Müller and Dirk Ströer were able to 
personally profit from the transactions.  However, because the three operating businesses were 
merged together before the flip to Ströer, it is difficult to know by how much Müller and Dirk 
Ströer personally profited on freeXmedia.  (Our best estimate is by €20.6 million, explained 
infra.)  It gets worse though. 
 
freeXmedia Acquisition is Much Worse than the Problematic Timeline Implies 
 
When Ströer agreed to buy freeXmedia from Media Ventures, two supervisors left the board, and 
one year later, the CFO resigned.  It appears as though a significant chunk of the €4.08 million 
consideration Media Ventures “paid” for freeXmedia was actually in the form of advertising on 
Ströer’s network – meaning that Ströer appears to have subsidized Media Ventures’s purchase.  
freeXmedia’s performance fell off a cliff after Ströer acquired it – sales compared to the same 6-
month period the previous year dropped by 30%.44  Amazingly, not only did Media Ventures 
receive the maximum possible earn out to which the parties had agreed, but Ströer actually 
increased the amount of the earn out after the acquisition.45 
 
Ströer’s Governance Structures Start to Disintegrate 
 
When Ströer’s board of supervisors began deliberating acquiring the companies from Media 
Ventures on November 29, 2012, the board consisted of six independent supervisors.46  By the 
time the board approved the acquisitions on December 16, 2012, two supervisors terminated 
their service.  One departing supervisor had started his new five year term only 18 months 
earlier, and the other had over one year remaining on his contract. 47,48  On 17 December 2013, 
Ströer announced that Alfried Bührdel, who had been Ströer’s CFO for 16 years, was resigning 
“for personal reasons”.49  Mr. Bührdel officially left February 21, 2014 (even though Ströer 
announced he would stay through the end of March). 50,51   He therefore did not sign the 
responsibility statement for Ströer’s 2013 financials, which was dated 11 March 2014.52  
Whatever Mr. Buhrdel’s “personal reasons” for leaving were, he began working as CFO at a new 
employer in September 2014.53   
 
Ströer ultimately partly offset its board of supervisor losses as a result of the freeXmedia 
imbroglio.  Christoph Vilanek, CEO of freenet when Media Ventures bought freeXmedia, joined 
Ströer’s board on 8 August 2013 – only seven months after Media Ventures bought freeXmedia.

Ströer’s Apparent Subsidy of Media Ventures’s Purchase 
 
The disclosure that Media Ventures paid €4.08 million for FreeXmedia conceals something 
important.  The amount of cash Media Ventures paid for freeXmedia was much lower than the 
headline purchase price.56  The balance of the consideration appears to have been free 
advertising for freeXmedia’s seller, freenet, on the Ströer network.  We consider the use of 
Ströer resources for the primary benefit of insiders to be improper, and we doubt there are many 
corporate governance experts in the world who would disagree with our view. 
 
freenet’s 2012 Annual Report reads: 
 


“On December 4, 2012 the freenet.de GmbH (whose sole shareholder is the company), 
closed a contract with Media Ventures GmbH, Cologne, selling all of its freeXmedia 
GmbH shares. This transaction was carried on January 1, 2013. For the sale, a purchase 
price of T€ 4,080 was agreed. The amount was split in T€ 2,080 thousand payable in cash 
and the remaining T€ 2,000 payable until December 31, 2014 through offset with 
services from a media contract, which freenet AG concluded with the buyer.” 57  
 


 Media Ventures’s 2013 annual report ties to freenet’s disclosure – it reads in relevant part: 
 


“The purchase price for the acquisition of shares in freeXmedia GmbH, Ströer Digital 
Group GmbH, sunandstyle Touristik GmbH and the Comvel GmbH totaled T€4,412.  Of 
which in 2013, T€1,372 was spent on liquid assets.  Already in 2012, an advance 
payment of T€524 was made for the purchase of freeXmedia GmbH.  Furthermore, 
T€1,000 were gained through services. The remaining T€1,516 will be provided by 
payments and services in the year 2014.” 58

58 Part VII. Notes to the cash flow statement 


Page 21 of 62
We believe the media contract with the acquirer is highly likely for advertising through Ströer.  
If that conclusion is correct, Ströer effectively subsidized the purchase price for the flip.  Media 
Ventures and Ströer have had a contract under which Media Ventures receives free access to 
excess inventory in the Ströer network. Unfortunately, Ströer has released limited details on this 
agreement.  The following disclosures are relevant: 
 


• “Under one of these agreements, Media Ventures GmbH undertakes to supply Ströer 
Sales & Services GmbH with advertising copy free of charge for Ströer Sales & Services 
GmbH which Ströer Sales & Services GmbH uses in order to cover advertising spaces 
which have not been booked. It remains Ströer Sales & Services GmbH’s discretion 
when, where and to which extent advertising copy supplied by Media Ventures GmbH is 
used. Media Ventures GmbH has to bear the cost of fixation. The agreement provides for 
an indefinite term and may be terminated with two months notice to the end of a calendar 
year.”59  


• “At the meeting on 26 May 2014, the supervisory board approved the expansion of the 
existing marketing agreement with Media Ventures GmbH. Mr. Dirk Ströer did not take 
part in the resolution due to a possible conflict of interest.”60  


 
Freenet has advertised on Ströer’s OOH network.  After Freenet sold freeXmedia, one of its 
primary businesses has been a virtual mobile phone operator, mobilcom-debitel GmbH.61 
Ironically, Ströer chose to highlight mobilcom’s “station domination” OOH advertising in the 29 
April 2015 Capital Markets Day investor presentation in Berlin.  We are presently unable to 
determine whether the below advertising was part of the consideration freenet received for 
freeXmedia.

who is a disgruntled former employee of Ströer, alleged that Ströer is suing a former senior 
executive in Turkey for using the OOH ad network to advertise for companies in which he is an 
investor.  If this allegation is correct, it would show that Ströer agrees it is improper for insiders 
to have access to the media assets of a public company for self enrichment – in our opinion, at 
least when those insiders aren’t Udo Müller and Dirk Ströer.) 
 
freeXmedia’s Performance Declines Sharply Following Ströer’s Purchase 
 
After Ströer acquired freeXmedia, freeXmedia lost two major publishers; the cost of integrating 
the company was significantly higher because expected synergies did not occur; and projected 
sales did not materialize.62 
 
Ströer Pays an Earn Out to Media Ventures in Excess of the Contracted Value 
 
The acquisition of freeXmedia, Ströer Interactive, and Business Advertising included an earn out 
of €9.85 million. 63  However, Ströer’s liability associated with the earn out increased to €10.7 
million by December 31, 2013. 64  Yet sales at freeXmedia declined sharply post-acquisition.65

Media Ventures reported in 2014 receiving €10.7 million in earn outs.66  As far as we are aware, 
Ströer never explained why the earn out increased. 
 
Attempting to Estimate Media Ventures’s Profit on freeXmedia 
 
One way of estimating by how much Müller and Dirk Ströer personally profited on the 
transaction is to try to put multiples on the other two operating businesses Ströer acquired in the 
bundle, SIG and Business Advertising.  SIG generated EBITDA in 2012 of €3.0 million.  Placing 
a 10x multiple on it would therefore yield implied consideration of €30 million.  Business 
Advertising only published net income in its annual report, so we cannot back into EBITDA.  Its 
2012 net income was €774,000.  At a 20x multiple, the implied valuation for Business 
Advertising would have been €15.5 million – because Media Ventures only owned 50.4%, it 
would have received €7.8 million.  With the €10.7 million earn out, consideration totaled €60.2 
million.  Under these assumptions, Müller and Dirk Ströer’s company would have earned a profit 
of €22.4 million on its €2.0 million cash investment.  An 11-bagger wouldn’t have been too 
shabby for six months of work – it’s probably enough to earn the respect of FMCN chairman 
Jiang Nanchun.  
 
freeXmedia Conclusion 
 
We believe that freeXmedia is more significant than an egregious series of transactions.  We 
view it as a window into the inner motivations of those who run Ströer, formulate its strategies, 
and are its public face.  As our report shows, there are many other issues with Ströer; but, there 
are also numerous questions that are unanswerable due to a scarcity of information.  The 
freeXmedia self-dealing makes a strong case that insiders should not be given the benefit of the 
doubt when such questions arise. 
 
Investors should note that Ströer’s purchase of these assets from Media Ventures was one of 
three pillars upon which Ströer launched its digital strategy.  (It appears that one of the other 
pillars almost immediately became highly troubled, which Ströer has yet to own up to.  The 
company treats the least questionable pillar, Adscale GmbH as barely relevant today – its top line 
showed zero growth the year after Ströer acquired it.67  Ströer’s internal investor relations 
representative said “looking back now, we don’t really need [ad exchanges]. It’s not a core part 
of the business,” when we spoke with her.)68  The potential for Müller and Dirk Ströer to have 
made unjustified profits contributes to our belief that the entire digital strategy lacks substance.  
 
 IX.  Ströer Insiders’ Self-Dealing Goes Beyond freeXmedia 
 
We believe that insiders’ self-dealing goes well beyond freeXmedia.  The synergies Müller and 
Dirk Ströer generate from transacting with Ströer are more obvious to us than the synergies 
Ströer claims in its digital strategy.  There is a circular flow of money between Ströer on one 
hand, and Müller and Dirk Ströer on the other.  Müller and Dirk Ströer appear to have sold at

least approximately €400 million of Ströer shares since 2012.69,70  A Lichtenstein stiftung 
(foundation) that could be connected to Dirk Ströer appears in November 2015 to have sold 
shares approximately worth €127 million.71,72  (As we discuss infra, Messrs. Müller and Ströer 
may even have broken the law by not properly disclosing certain of their transactions.)  In 
addition, Dirk Ströer receives additional revenue streams from Ströer through a company he 
owns called Ströer Aussenwerbung GmbH & Co. KG (“SAW”).73 
 
The myriad business relationships we believe exist between Ströer and insiders include: 
 


• Media Ventures, which invests in companies that seem to frequently advertise through 
Ströer,   


• Media Ventures, which as of 2014, had access to free advertising on Ströer’s network,74 
• SAW, which sells billboard advertising through Ströer, has been expanding its network, 


and uses Ströer for many of its back office functions.75 
 
Insider-affiliated businesses seem to be consumers and providers of Ströer advertising space.  
Given the governance issues we discuss in this report, along with our concerns over Ströer’s 
accounting, we believe it is reasonable to raise questions about what controls are in place to 
prevent abuse. 
 
Media Ventures Portfolio Companies are Prolific Users of Ströer Advertising 
 
Media Ventures is a venture capital / private equity investment vehicle.  We found evidence 
indicating that at least nine Media Ventures investees have run advertising campaigns on Ströer’s 
network.  We can think of two possible ramifications of this information.  One possibility is that 
Media Ventures invests money in these companies (a significant portion of which is arguably 
generated by Müller and Dirk Ströer’s dealings with Ströer), and that these investees are then 
paying Ströer for the advertising.  The advertising payments would obviously boost Ströer’s 
revenues.  Another likely possibility is that these companies are taking advantage of Ströer’s 
provision of free advertising to Media Ventures.  In several instances, OOH advertising 
campaigns appeared to be very important to Media Ventures’s investments. 
 
Of course, both possibilities could be true as well.  Ströer should disclose much more about this 
relationship.   
 
The following lists the Media Ventures’s investees for which we have found evidence of 
advertising on Ströer’s network.  Details of each company’s probable ad campaigns are in

SAW Does Significant Business with Ströer 
 
Moreover, Dirk Ströer owns a company called Ströer Aussenwerbung GmbH & Co. KG 
(“SAW”).76  SAW is a significant counterparty of Ströer – with tens of millions of euros flowing 
in both directions between the two companies each year.  SAW has a portfolio of OOH 
advertising locations, which as of the date of Ströer’s prospectus SAW exclusively leases to 
Ströer.77  While Dirk Ströer inherited SAW from his father, Ströer co-founder Heinz Ströer, we 
are unable to understand how continuing this relationship is appropriate.   
 
Ströer subsidiary Ströer Sales & Services GmbH appears to sell advertising on SAW-owned 
locations.  It appears that Ströer earns a 10% commission on these sales.78  Based on the €6.5 
million in commissions Ströer disclosed earning selling SAW locations in 2015, Ströer would 
have paid SAW a gross amount of approximately €58.5 million.79  Ströer discloses receiving 
payments from SAW in 2015 for services of €22.6 million.80 
 
Moreover, SAW expanded its portfolio in 2014 with 1,000 locations in Berlin.81  We are further 
unable to understand why Ströer, which as a public company presumably has a lower cost of   
capital than SAW, did not choose to acquire these locations for itself.  Moreover, we believe that 
Ströer has OOH EBITDA margins in Germany of 20% to 30%.  To receive only a 10% 
commission might not be in the best interest of outside shareholders.   
 
X.  Unreported and Opaque Insider Sales 


 
Germany’s law requires large holders of shares and financial instruments with voting rights to 
disclose their holdings and transactions.  These disclosures are to be made to the public company 
and the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (“BaFin”).  Ordinarily, a company is 
blameless if the holders do not notify it of their activity. However, it is a different matter when 
the interest holders involved in the transactions are the CEO and a non-management member of 
the Supervisory Board. Udo Müller and Dirk Ströer appear to have failed to comply with the 
disclosure laws – until the penalty for not disclosing was significantly strengthened in November 
2015, which appears to have triggered a raft of disclosures and outright sales by Messrs. Müller 
and Ströer.  While our research has identified numerous important substantive issues with 
Ströer’s business and financials, it is items such as these failures to disclose that raise critical 
questions such as: 
 


• Are this person’s interests really aligned with those of investors? 
• Is this person likely to deal with investors in a forthright way?

turnover generated with the distribution of the relevant advertising units, regularly 10%. Ströer Sales & Services 
GmbH is obliged to reimburse SAW for certain costs incurred when affixing posters on to the advertising units, if 
and to the extent that Ströer Sales & Services GmbH is paid for these costs by the relevant customer.”

• Is this a sign of greater ethical lapses or non-compliance by this person in conducting the 
company’s business? 


• Is there a greater cultural problem at the company that allowed these persons to remain in 
apparent violation of the law for an extended period of time? 


 
Background 
 
German law provides for two separate minimum disclosure thresholds with respect to voting 
rights notifications – 3% for stocks and 5% for other financial instruments. The deadline for 
filing a voting right notification with respect to such financial instruments is four trading days at 
the latest. Any non-compliance of the obligation to notify voting rights resulting out of financial 
instruments other than stock could—under the old legal regime—only be fined with a penalty of 
up to €1 million. Under the new regime that took effect on 26 November 2015, such non-
compliance may also lead to a loss of rights associated with the stocks held by the relevant 
person in the respective issuer, i.e. if a shareholder of a stock corporation does not disclose his 
other financial instruments in such corporation, he might lose the dividend and voting rights 
arising out of such stocks. 
 
Müller’s Daisy Chaining of Rights 
 
Media Ventures (“MV”), the investment company owned by Dirk Ströer (51%) and Udo Müller 
(49%), acquired 6,771,546 shares in the Ströer company on 3 June 2013 after a share increase to 
finance the acquisition of freeXmedia, Ströer Interactive, and Business Advertising. On 25 June 
2013, MV apparently sold half of its shares to Ströer (now Delphi) Beteiligungsgesellschaft 
GmbH, which is controlled by Dirk Ströer.82  
 
While it appeared that MV kept 3,385,773 (6.93%) voting rights, on 3 June 2013 MV had in fact 
sold 3,385,773 call options to a Dutch holding company called Green Towers Holding, B.V. 
(GTH). GTH itself is controlled by Dacapo 2 GmbH83, which is controlled by Avalanche GmbH, 
which, finally, is controlled by Matthias Rumpelhardt.84,85,86,87 Due to such control, the very 
same voting rights are also attributable to the controlling shareholders under the applicable 
German disclosure law. 
 


Six days before the law change that greatly increased the penalty for non-disclosure of voting 
rights, on 20 November 2015, MV disposed of its shares in Ströer entirely and GTH disposed 
of its call options.88  It appears that Allianz might have acquired a few of the options and 
exercised them on the very same day.89  We do not know what happened to these shares. 
However, it cannot be excluded that a person a person close to (but not controlled by)

Rumpelhardt/Müller acquired the bulk of the instruments, but stayed below the minimum 
notification thresholds. In this potential event, such person might not be subject to disclosure 
obligations. 
 
Rumpelhardt does not notify Ströer of the call option acquisition in June 2013 until 23 
November 2015, 3 days after their disposal.909192 Furthermore, not until the voting rights 
notification of Udo Müller dated 24 November 2015 do we learn that Rumpelhardt’s voting 
rights were also attributed to Udo Müller due to a fiduciary agreement.93 This fiduciary 
agreement is not publicly available. We don’t know why Rumpelhardt would have agreed to this 
arrangement. Rumpelhardt is close to Müller, however: he is a former CEO of Ströer Media 
International GmbH, and a business partner of Müller.94,95 
 
Müller appears to have acted with negligence at a minimum by not disclosing his voting rights 
accorded to him by the call options. Rumpelhardt appears to have acted with negligence at a 
minimum by not disclosing to Ströer his voting rights until late November 2015, over two years 
after acquiring the call options and three days after selling them.  
 
Did Dirk Ströer Give His Shares Away? 
 
On 29 May 2013, according to the below source, Dirk Ströer disposed of 2.8 million Ströer 
shares for no consideration.  Based on the below voting rights notification by Sambara Stiftung 
(Liechtenstein) we assume that those shares were transferred to Sambara Stiftung 
(Liechtenstein).  Sambara Stiftung acquired an additional 400,000 shares in Q4 2014, bringing its 
ownership to 6.65%.96 The foundation disposed all its shares on 20 November 2015.97 Was this a 
magnanimous donation to a foreign charitable foundation? Color us skeptical.

…and Sambara Stiftung acquires 2.8 million shares the same day 


 
Source: Ströer Media 2013 Annual Report 


 
Liechtenstein stiftungs have a checkered history. The tiny principality’s financial regulations and 
lack of transparency led many wealthy foreigners to establish foundations there to avoid taxes in 
their home country. A major tax evasion scandal in Germany centered on Liechtenstein erupted 
in 2008, for example, ensnaring numerous corporate executives and politicians.98 EU leaders are 
now renewing a push for transparency in response to the Panama Papers affair. Germany’s 
finance minister Wolfgang Schäuble is emphasizing the “need to share an publish the names of 
the ultimate beneficiaries of all corporate structures, including shell companies, trusts, and 
foundations that can offer anonymity to their users.”99 His efforts are gaining traction with his 
colleagues of the 4 other largest economies in Europe.100 
 
We are encouraged by these developments.  Because of the timing of Sambara Stiftung’s 
complete disposal of its Ströer shares—the same day of the Müller/Rumplehardt sale and large 
stock sales by Dirk Ströer’s Ströer (now Delphi) Beteiligungsgesellschaft, and Udo Müller and

this, we infer that Dirk Ströer may be in violation of the law by not attributing the voting rights 
to himself. 
 
XI.  Suspected Lack of Impairment for Apparently Failed Investments Suggests Lack of 
Accountability at Ströer 
 
One of Ströer’s key early digital acquisitions was of Ballroom International CEE Holding in July 
2013.  Ballroom owned digital marketing companies in Turkey and Eastern Europe, and its 
largest operations were in Turkey and Poland.103  Ströer’s rationale for acquiring Ballroom was 
that Ballroom’s Turkey and Poland operations supposedly dovetailed nicely with Ströer’s 
international OOH business.  The acquisition resulted in goodwill €18 million.  Despite 
Ballroom appearing to have been a near total loss for Ströer, the company has not impaired the 
goodwill.  The lack of impairment supports our contention that the company is misleading 
investors about its performance.  In our view, unwinding the Ballroom debacle gave the 
company an opportunity to misleadingly boost reported Digital organic growth by close to five 
percentage points, and overall organic growth by approximately one percentage point.104  (See: 
Organic Growth in Digital and Overall Appear to be Greatly Overstated.) 
 
Ballroom was a rollup of media assets in Turkey, Poland, Hungary, Romania, and Czech 
Republic.  While we do not know its 2012 revenue, it reported post-acquisition 2013 revenue of 
€16.6 million.105 (Ballroom entered the Romanian market in 2009 (although this wasn’t publicly 
disclosed until 2011), followed by acquisitions in Poland (2010), Czech Republic (2011) and 
Turkey (2011).106,107,108,109,110  Poland-based private equity firm Enterprise Investors took a 


                                                
101 Ströer SE 2015 Separate Financial Statement, pp. 35-45. 
102 Our investigators contacted the Liechtenstein trade register to retrieve the filings of Sambara Stiftung. However, 
the authority informed them that the registration details for Sambara Stiftung are not publicly available because it 
has the legal form of hinterlegte Stiftung. The filings of this entity are solely available to the representatives and 
board members of this foundation.  
103 Ballroom’s total post-acquisition revenue in 2013 was €16.6 million. Ballroom’s Turkey segment generated 
€12.1 million in post-acquisition revenue in 2013. We calculated this by subtracting €94.6 million in Turkey OOH 
revenue from €106.2 million Total Turkey revenue (Stroer 2013 Annual Report). Ballroom’s Poland segment 
generated €3.3 million in the 2013 post-acquisition period. We arrived at this figure by subtracting Ballroom’s 
Turkey segment revenue (€12.1 million) and the revenue reported by Ballroom’s Czech and Hungarian subsidiaries 
in their 2013 financial statements (€1.3 million) from Ballroom’s total post-acquisition revenue in 2013 (€16.6 
million). 
104 As we explain herein, we calculate organic growth rates using the company’s methodology that are significantly 
lower than disclosed.

34.65% stake in Ballroom for €6.25 million in November 2011.111  Ballroom initially planned on 
IPOing on the Warsaw exchange in 2012, 112 but choose to be acquired by Ströer instead. 
 
Ströer announced the acquisition of a majority stake on 15 July 2013113, and it closed on 1 
August.114  Ströer was quite bullish on its acquisition of Ballroom: 
 


“With this acquisition, Ströer is going international with the expansion of its business 
model to include marketing of online advertising, which has already been launched in 
Germany. This will make Ströer a full service provider in the core markets of Turkey and 
Poland as well. Ströer will hence be a relevant player on the market from the outset. In 
Turkey, Ströer is at the forefront in terms of outdoor advertising. With Ballroom Group, 
the Group will rank first place among online marketers.”115   


 
By the end of 2013, Ströer held a 62.3% stake in Ballroom, and had pared the company down to 
primarily focus on Turkey and Poland.116  However, by 2015, it was apparent that Poland and 
Turkey had gone very wrong.  Ströer disposed in 2014 and 2015 of what appear to be key 
operating entities in each market for close to zero consideration.  Ballroom subsidiary Evolution 
Media Net SP. Z.O.O. filed for bankruptcy in March 2015, and allegedly Ströer dismissed CEO 
Muriej Minder over suspected (unspecified) irregularities.117  Ströer disposed of Evolution Media 
Net for zero sometime in 2015.118  That is a remarkable reversal of fortune for a company that in 
just five months in 2013 contributed, by our calculation, €3.3 million in revenue to Ströer’s 
performance.119   
 
Ballroom Turkey has a similar fact pattern to that of Ballroom Poland.  The key operating 
subsidiaries in Turkey were Linkz, SEM AS and Vidyoda .120  As part of the Ballroom’s 
acquisition, Reklamz founder Orkun Tekin became head of Strategic Development and 
Investments at Ballroom and a member of the board.  Tekin and other Turkish partners obtained 
a 10% stake in Ballroom.121  Ströer renamed Vidyoda RZV and disposed of Reklamz for €0 in 
2014.122,123  A disgruntled former Ballroom employee alleges, however, that RZV included

116 Two non-controlling shareholders who departed around the time of Ströer’s purchase took over six of Ballroom’s 
subsidiaries in return.  (Ströer 2013 Annual Report, p. 103.) We believe five of the subsidiaries taken over by the 
departing shareholders were Adaptive Holding Zrt. (Hungary), Adaptive Network (Hungary), AdEvolution Srl. 
(Romania), Beyond Media Srl. (Romania), and Midas Media.net SRL (Romania), based on their inclusion in 
Ballroom International’s 2011 annual report and press reports, and the fact that they were never cited as a subsidiary 
by Ströer. (http://www.wall-street.ro/articol/Marketing-PR/103566/Un-fond-de-investitii-german-detine-51-din-

Reklamz’s assets (see the section on Project Zero below).  Furthermore, Ballroom founded a new 
subsidiary called Digital Partners Reklam Hizmetleri A.S. (Digital Partners) in January 2014, 
taking a 90% stake in the new entity.124  Despite being Ballroom’s most profitable subsidiary in 
2014, Ströer disposed of Digital Partners in 2015 for no consideration.125  It seems odd that 
Ströer would not have been able to realize at least a few million euro for Digital Partners, given 
that it supposedly generated net income of €340,000 in 2014, and in our estimate, Digital 
Partners had revenues of at least €3 million and as much €7 million as a result.126,127,128   
 
(Ströer disclosed that it disposed of Digital Partners Reklam Hizmetleri A.S., GAN Technologies 
UG, NEODAU GmbH & Co. KG and NEODAU Verwaltungs GMBH, realizing “[n]o 
significant purchase price or significant gain on disposal.”)129  
 
What happened in Turkey in the approximately two years Ströer controlled Ballroom is not clear; 
however, Ballroom Turkey appears to have generated some internal controversy at Ströer.  The 
Turkish Gazette reports that two Ballroom founders were dismissed as directors of the board of a 
Turkey subsidiary named Linkz in February 2015, which Ströer owned at the time.130 The 
remaining Linkz board unanimously voted NOT to acquit the dismissed founders for their 
service in 2014.131   
 
An investigator found a former Ballroom Turkey employee through social media, and spoke with 
him by telephone.  The former employee was disgruntled and had left Ballroom / Ströer under 
acrimonious circumstances.  He alleges that Ballroom’s Turkey revenue and EBITDA were 
materially overstated, and that Ströer found out about it in 2014.  Ströer allegedly codenamed the 
internal investigation “project zero” in acknowledgement that the Turkey business was close to 
worthless.  The former employee alleges that Ströer reported the misstated numbers in its filings,

127 We derive at our revenue loss estimate as follows: Per Ströer 2015 Annual Report page 102 “Evolution Media 
Net sp. z.o.o., Digital Partners Reklam Hizmetleri A.S., GAN Technologies UG, NEODAU GmbH & Co. KG and 
NEODAU Verwaltungs GMBH were sold in the period under review. No significant purchase price or significant 
gain on disposal was realized.”  Subsequently, slide 28 in the presentation ‘Preliminary Figures FY2015’ dated 23 
February 2016 reports a €7.2 million loss in revenue due to discontinued operations and disposals. The vast majority 
of revenue most likely is from Digital Partners, as other disposed companies, GAN and NEODAU were startups 
with limited revenue, and Evolution Media was bankrupt. Digital Partners had after tax profit of €340K in 2014, 
according to Ströer’s 2014 Separate Financial Statement, p. 29. Assuming an EBITDA margin of 10% for Ströer’s 
digital segment, Digital Partners had revenue ranging from €3 million to €7 million.

even though it knew they were inaccurate.  We have not been able to corroborate the details of 
the allegations, and we acknowledge the quality of the source is questionable. 
 
In our opinion, Ströer not disclosing the failure of this pillar of its digital strategy, and not 
impairing Ballroom is egregiously misleading.  In fact, COO Christian Schmalzl evidently forgot 
about Ballroom when recently asked which acquisition was the best one Ströer has made in 
digital.  He replied “Well, in a way they were all really great…”132  Indeed. 
 
XII.  Cavalier About Capital Allocation 
 
In late February Ströer COO Christian Schmalzl gave a keynote at an event called Online 
Marketing Rock Stars.133  A trade publication article summarized his talk in an article titled “The 
Entire Online Marketing Industry is Talking about this Keynote”.134  We believe that the 
investment industry needs to have a conversation about this speech as well, focusing on the 
following issues:   
 
Against the backdrop of our belief that (i) Ströer overstated its Digital organic growth, and then 
still did not get the calculation right; (ii) Ströer disguised the true costs of its acquisitions in its 
cash flow statement; (iii) Ströer appears to have capitalized costs that should be expensed in 
order to inflate EBITDA; (iv) Ströer failed to impair at least one acquisition that went poorly; (v) 
Ströer insiders have engaged in significant amounts of self dealing; and (vi) Ströer’s corporate 
governance is lacking…Schmalzl’s speech seems stunning.  Here are some pertinent excerpts: 
 


“And our CEO and company founder Udo Müller is someone who started to consolidate 
the outdoor advertising market – I think it was 25 years ago.  He is an exceptionally 
gifted deal-maker and for him, every week that goes by without him buying a company or 
closing a deal, is a week wasted.” 
 
“As Phillip has pointed out – you have the balls, you can make an impact on the online 
field, even as an outdoor advertiser.  And we believe there may also be other areas in the 
market, where historical expertise is not primarily important, but rather the ability to 
detect change, to be set up dynamically as a company, and to be in a position where you 
can allow yourself to take risks.” 
 
“We are often asked the question, ‘If you take over so many companies, how do you deal 
with issues of integration?’…It is actually not that complex, unless you try to arrange 
post-merger integrations with consultants, complex structures and processes; but if you 
simply focus on the best way to help out new companies, and come up with good 
solutions to get them developed accordingly, it can work.”   
 
“And I think in the context of traditional media companies there is very, very often also 
talk about digital transformations.  If I were to try and describe our approach – I think it 
is not so much transformation, but transaction.  You just have to do something, get

started and then think about where you want to go.  But everything else evolves around 
the actual ‘doing’.  Theory is always an interesting part, but it doesn’t determine the 
outcome on its own.  In the end, you just have to do it; and I think that in the digital 
domain this is more important than anything else.” 
 
“Well to be completely honest – [the strategy regarding how to integrate acquired brands 
is] a bit of an open flank at the moment.  [Laughs]  Right now, there are so many things 
we are just now becoming aware of, especially in terms of marketing.  How many brands 
do I want / need?  That is one of those issues, that in all honesty, we are just now starting 
to tackle.  And we just haven’t found the right solution yet.  Is it right to just tell the 
people, ‘Look, there, right a the top you can see the name Ströer – everything else is 
unimportant.’  Maybe this is the right model; but maybe it’s also important to have a few 
sub-brands; or maybe we shouldn’t differentiate all that much.  At the moment I also 
think we’re leaning a little towards anarchy because we have been moving along at such 
a fast pace.  Of course we have to figure out a better structure for the image we present to 
the outside world – but also to our clients, various stakeholders and employees.” 


 
The event host, Phillip Westermann Meyer, also made a comment that seems telling about the 
impression that online marketing professionals have of the company: 
 


“You’ve made quite a lot of acquisitions and there’s a legend making its way around the 
market that your biggest shareholder, Udo Müller, is walking through the event area – 
maybe he was right here with us yesterday, when IMAX was here, and he says to 
himself, ‘Oh lookie here – these are all really cool companies; I think we’ll buy them!’  
So he sticks a red dot on the sales booths, so they’ll be bought up at a later date – live 
shopping, so to speak…”[audience laughs] 


 
XIII.  Governance Seems to be Extremely Investor Unfriendly 
 
Ströer’s governance in our view is problematic, and likely a root cause of many of the issues we 
have identified in our report.  In March 2016, Ströer changed to a new legal form, which we 
interpret as primarily serving the interests of Udo Müller and Dirk Ströer.  We note that Ströer’s 
present CFO is deeply involved at the board level with a questionable U.S. microcap company, 
causing us to question his judgment.  Ströer’s supervisory board has changed quite a bit in recent 
years, but in our opinion, generally lacks sufficient independence from Messrs. Müller and 
Ströer.  We note that although Dirk Ströer was reported to have resigned from the supervisory 
board in November 2015, Ströer’s website shows him still on the board – despite clearly having 
been recently updated. 
 
Legal Form Helps to Entrench Müller and Dirk Ströer 
 
Ströer has had three corporate legal forms since going public in 2010. 
 


• July 2002-October 2014: Corporation limited by share ownership (AG) 
• October 2014-March 2016: European joint stock company (SE) 
• March 2016-present: Partnership limited by shares (SE & Co. KGaA) 


Page 36 of 62
We are struck by the timing of Ströer’s transition to a SE & Co. KGaA so soon after becoming a 
SE.  Ströer provided the following reasons for the change: “strengthen Ströer SE’s financing 
ability on the capital market and facilitate possible attempts to raise capital in future and thereby 
the company’s further development whilst preserving Ströer SE’s position as a family 
company.”135  The articles of association of Ströer SE & Co. KGaA specify that the General 
Partner, who is controlled by Dirk Ströer and Udo Müller, will retain control of the company as 
long as its shareholders jointly hold at least 10% of the company’s share capital.136  This helps to 
entrench them in a control position over Ströer, even if they significantly decrease their 
shareholdings.  We do not see this as beneficial to outside investors. 
 
Ströer CFO Involved with Questionable U.S.-listed Company 
 
Ströer’s CFO Bernd Metzner is on the board of directors of Anavex Life Sciences (Nasdaq: 
AVXL), a microcap development stage biotech company.  Metzner chairs all of the company’s 
board committees: audit, compensation, corporate governance, and nominating.137  Anavex is a 
controversial company, and received a subpoena in December 2015 from the United States 
Securities and Exchange Commission.138  Anavex “believes the subpoena and investigation 
relate to the recent unusual activity in the market for the Company’s shares.”139  
 
Constantly Shifting Supervisory Board Membership 
 
In our opinion, Ströer’s board of supervisors is oddly devoid of truly independent supervisors.  In 
December 2013 – at the time Ströer agreed to acquire freeXmedia and the Ströer Digital Group 
from Media Ventures (owned 51% by Dirk Ströer and 49% by Udo Müller) – two directors left 
Ströer’s board. 140,141  In October 2014, Ströer further slimmed its board to three supervisors: 
Dirk Ströer, Ulrich Voigt (as of November 2014), and Christoph Vilanek.142  Mr. Vilanek was 
the CEO of freenet at the time Media Ventures acquired freeXmedia from it.143  The 
circumstances surrounding the chain of ownership from freeXmedia to Media Ventures, and then 
to Ströer give rise to concerns about Mr. Vilanek’s independence from Mr. Müller and Mr. 
Ströer.   
 
Three additional board members were elected during the 2015 Annual General Meeting in 
September in preparation for the change in legal form from SE to KGaA: Julia Flemmerer, 
Michael Remagen, and Martin Diedrichs. We question the rationale for adding these people to

the board.  Ms. Flemmerer is Udo Müller ’s wife.144  Mr. Remagen is a tax advisor for Udo 
Müller personally, and for Dirk Ströer’s company Ströer Aussenwerbung, which does business 
with Ströer.145 
 
Dirk Ströer resigned from the board in November 2015 and was replaced with a Deutsche 
Telekom executive.146  However, given that he is a shareholder of the general partner of the 
company, we are unclear whether his influence has diminished much.  Moreover, Ströer’s 
website still shows him as a supervisor:147 
 


 
 
Strangely, this part of the website has been recently updated.  The below screen shot was taken 
from the same web page 11 days earlier.148  Note that two of the supervisors were updated.

XIV.  Curious Changes to Subsidiary Shareholdings 
 
We found several instances of curious changes in the shareholder makeup of some of Ströer’s 
subsidiaries.  These oddities heighten our accounting related concerns about the company.  We 
made the following observations while reviewing documents obtained from Germany’s corporate 
registries (Bundesanzeiger and Unternehmensregister). These findings raise questions for which 
we have no ready answers. We invite Ströer to explain the rationale for these transactions. 
 
ADselect GmbH 
 
On 15 June 2015, Business Advertising GmbH became a 100% shareholder of ADselect after 
two previous stake purchases.149  The same day, former ADselect CEO Ralf Hammerath became 
a minority shareholder of Business Advertising GmbH after a capital increase.  Ströer’s 50.4% 
share in Business Advertising remains the same after this capital increase. 
 


• Why was Hammerath offered a minority stake in Business Advertising? Why did Ströer 
contribute capital in order to allow Hammerath in while avoiding dilution?  
 


Pacemaker Targeting GmbH / Pacemaker AOS GmbH 
 
Ströer Digital Group GmbH (SDG), a fully owned subsidiary of Ströer, owned 100% of 
Pacemaker as of 16 August 2013.  On 9 October of that year, however, SDG was diluted to 80%, 


                                                
149 Liste der Gesellschafter der ADselect GmbH and Business Advertising GmbH obtained from

Page 39 of 62
allocating the rest to shareholders of MBR Targeting GmbH (79% owned by SDG).150  SDG then 
increased its stake in Pacemaker back to 93.3% in two purchases by October 2015.151 
 


• Why was Ströer’s stake in Pacemaker diluted? Why was a minority stake provided to 
MBR Targeting minority shareholders? Why did Ströer buy back much of the stake it had 
sold two years prior? 


 
OMS Vermaktungs GmbH & Co. KG 
 
Ströer acquired in 100% of OMS Vermaktungs in January 2016. That same month, OMS-Online 
Marketing Service GmbH & Co. KG (the seller of OMS Vermaktungs) obtained a 10% stake in 
Ströer Digital Group GmbH following a non-cash capital increase.152,153 
 


• Why did Ströer dilute its stake in Ströer Digital Group and why did it dilute shareholder 
value with a capital increase to do so? 


 
ECE flatmedia GmbH 
 
On 2 November 2011, Ströer Digital Media (later INFOSCREEN) acquired 100% of ECE 
flatmedia from flatmedia Beteiligungsgesellschaft m.b.H. & Co. KG, a subsidiary of ECE 
Holding.  Ströer sold 10% of this stake back to an ECE Holding subsidiary on 1 June 2012 and a 
14.9% stake in September 2013.154  The only explanation that Ströer provided for these 
transactions was that they “more closely align company and shareholder interests.”155156 
 


• Why did Ströer sell back such a large stake of ECE flatmedia back to the original seller 
so soon after acquiring them?  Bear in mind that Ströer called this acquisition “a strategic 
step to further capitalize on the digitalization of out-of-home advertising and significantly 
expand its reach.”157 


• What were the company and shareholder interests that prompted these transactions? 
 
XV.  Infoscreen Profitability Seems to be an Extreme Outlier 
 
Ströer’s 2015 Digital results were greatly boosted by its reclassification of public video to 
Digital.158  Infoscreen’s profitability and growth in profitability are outliers versus the 
comparables we can find.  Ströer’s primary public video operating entity is Infoscreen GmbH.159

Page 40 of 62
Ströer reported that Infoscreen generated profit of €30.0 million in 2015.160  This was an increase 
of 73.4% over 2014 profit of €17.3 million.161  However, the overall number of screens only 
grew 16.7% from 3,000 to 3,500.162  Thus, profit per screen jumped 48.8% from €5,760 to 
€8,570 in 2015.  Gains in 2014 were much more modest, and in-line – profit grew 22.7% from 
€14.1 million, and profit per screen grew 14.5% from €5,025. (Total screens grew 7.1% from 
2,800.)163  
 
We understand that the company has recently told investors that Infoscreen’s EBITDA margins 
are approximately 50%.  If our understanding of the company’s comments is correct, 
Infoscreen’s profitability appears to be a substantial outlier in the industry.  We have been 
advised that, according to an industry expert, 50% EBITDA margins on public video displays are 
unheard of.  The following comparables cause us to question how Infoscreen can achieve such 
results. 
 


• Visual Art is Sweden’s largest operator of digital OOH advertising displays.  It is a 
digital signage pure play.  Its EBITDA margin in 2014 was 4.2% on revenue of 
approximately €12 million.  Its EBITDA margin in 2015 was 12.7% on revenue of 
approximately €22 million.164 


• Cittadino is a German pure play digital OOH advertising company recently acquired by 
ProSiebenSat.1 Media SE.  It has over 11,000 digital displays in over 3,000 locations, 
and claims to reach an audience of up to 55 million people.165  It broke even in 2013, and 
lost €1.3 million in 2014. 166   


• Media Frankfurt is Germany’s largest digital airport display network, with over 2,000 
media at the Frankfurt airport.167  Its EBITDA margin in 2013 was 13.2% on €34.2 
million in revenue.  Its EBITDA margin in 2014 was 12.8% on €33 million in revenue.168 
 


The only public video company we could find that EBITDA margins equal to or greater than 
50% is called China MediaExpress Holdings Inc. (“CCME”).  However, CCME was a complete 
fraud – it stopped filing financial statements after we exposed the fraud in early 2011.169  CCME 
reported EBITDA of 62.4% in 2009 and 68.0% in 2010.170

Do you want to start with a few charts, 
or should we get straight down to 
business?

C. Sch. 


Genau. Ich hatte überlegt, ob die Leute 
hier überhaupt wissen, was wir so 
machen. Und dachte mir – damit die 
Diskussion auch nicht zu sehr verengt 
wird nur auf das Thema Online-
Marketing – erzähle ich einfach zum 
Eingang einmal ein bisschen etwas 
[darüber], was wir so in den letzten – 
ich würde sagen drei Jahren – 
aufgegleist haben. Dann glaube ich, 
kann man auch ein bisschen 
weiterdiskutieren, auch über so ein 
Thema wie Adtech. 


I agree – straight to business. I was 
wondering if the people here even know 
what kind of business we are in. And 
then I thought to myself – so the 
discussion doesn't focus too much on the 
topic of online marketing – I'll start off 
by telling you a little about what we have 
been doing in the past… I would say 
three years. I think then it will be okay to 
take the discussion a little further and 
also include topics such as ad tech.

ein bisschen auf die Zahlen zu schauen. 
Wenn man nur den Umsatz betrachtet... 
Wenn man die Anzahl der Mitarbeiter 
betrachtet, wenn man die Ergebnisse, 
Entwicklung sich ansieht – am Ende 
auch so etwas wie Marktkapitalisierung 
– haben wir innerhalb von drei Jahren 
einen extremen Transformationsprozess 
und enormen Wandel hingelegt mit der 
Firma. 


It is not that easy to give a presentation 
while I'm sitting down. Perhaps, in order 
to give an overview of the challenges our 
company is facing, it is sometimes 
worthwhile to take a quick look at the 
numbers. If you only look at the sales... 
If you look at the number of employees; 
if you take a look at the results, 
developments – towards the end even 
such a thing as market capitalization – 
within three years, we have undergone 
an extreme transformation process and 
enormous change within the company.

In einem börsennotierten Unternehmen 
schaut man natürlich immer sehr, sehr 
stark auf die Zahlen, aber das 
eigentliche Interessante ist die 
Mitarbeiterentwicklung und der Anteil 
unserer Digitalumsätze. Denn wir 


In a publicly traded company you 
naturally always pay very, very close 
attention to the numbers, but the really 
interesting thing is the staff development 
and our share in digital revenues. 
Because this year – if we take a quick 


Page 42 of 62
werden in diesem Jahr – wenn wir die 
Ergebnisse betrachten – wahrscheinlich 
so bei 50% Digitalanteil sein, und vor 
nicht einmal drei Jahren waren wir erst 
bei 5%. Das erklärt vielleicht ein 
bisschen, welchen enormen Wandel wir 
als Firma auch vollzogen haben. 


look at the results – our digital content 
will probably rank at around 50%, but 
less than three years ago, we were only 
at 5%. This might explain the enormous 
transformation we have made as a 
company. 


00:01:48 
C. Sch. 


Und ich glaube, das, was von außen oft 
sichtbar wird, ist, dass wir relativ viele 
Firmen gekauft haben. Ich habe leider 
nicht alle drauf gekriegt, das ist jetzt 
nur so ein kleinerer Auszug von dem, 
was wir gemacht haben. Und unser CO 
und Unternehmensgründer Udo Müller 
ist jemand, der vor – ich glaube 25 
Jahren – angefangen hat, den 
Außenwerbemarkt zu konsolidieren. Er 
ist einfach ein begnadeter Deal-Maker 
und für ihn ist eigentlich jede Woche, 
in der er keine Firma kauft oder einen 
Deal machen kann, eine verlorene 
Woche. Und insofern sind wir seit drei 
Jahren einfach intensiv daran zu 
überlegen: "Wie kriegt man ein 
bisschen mehr Struktur in den 
Digitalmarkt hinein?" 


I think – and this is what is often quite 
visible from the outside – that we have 
also bought up quite a lot of companies. 
Unfortunately, I did not manage to 
squeeze them all in, so this is only a 
smaller excerpt of what we have 
achieved. And our CO and company 
founder Udo Müller is someone who 
started to consolidate the outdoor 
advertising market – I think it was 25 
years ago. He is an exceptionally gifted 
deal-maker and for him, every week that 
goes by without him buying a company 
or closing a deal, is a week wasted. 
Insofar, we have spent the last three 
years thinking, "How we can manage to 
give the digital market a little more 
structure?" 


00:02:25 
C. Sch. 


Das sieht jetzt vielleicht auf den ersten 
Blick ein bisschen wild aus, aber das, 
was wir an Zielen strategisch verfolgen, 
hat einen relativ klaren Hintergrund. 
Denn momentan versuchen wir die 
Firma in 5 grundsätzliche strategische 
Felder zu entwickeln. Das 1. Feld ist 
das ganze Thema 
"Außenwerbeinfrastruktur". 


This might appear a little wild at first 
glance, but our strategic objectives all 
have a relatively clear background. 
Because at the moment we are trying to 
develop the company in 5 fundamental 
strategic fields. The 1st field envelops the 
entire issue of "outdoor advertising 
infrastructure". 


00:02:47 
C. Sch. 


Wir haben in Deutschland ungefähr 
230.000 Werbeflächen. Historisch 
waren das einmal nur Holzflächen, die 
mit Papier beklebt wurden. Womit wir 
seit vier, fünf Jahren anfangen, ist die 
Flächen zu digitalisieren – durch LCDs, 
LEDs – jetzt in letzter Zeit auch indem 
wir Beacons dort installieren. Das 
heißt, dass, was klassischerweise 
Außenwerbung war, wird dann mehr 
und mehr digital und damit ein Teil 


We have approximately 230,000 
billboards in Germany. Historically 
speaking, these used to be only wood 
surfaces covered with paper. But during 
the last four, five years we have begun to 
digitize the areas – through using LCDs, 
LEDs – and of late also by installing 
beacons there. This means, what was 
traditionally known as outdoor 
advertising, is now being more and more 
digitized, and thus becomes part of the

00:03:15 
C. Sch. 


Vielleicht spricht man bald auch 
darüber, dass [man] so anständige 
Werbekampagnen über drei Screens – 
cross-device[s] – aussteuert, nämlich 
über mobile Endgeräte, über Home 
Screens, aber eben auch über Public 
Screens. Und den Teil des Marktes 
haben wir historisch gut besetzt und wir 
versuchen den weiter zu digitalisieren. 


Maybe soon there will be talk about 
decent advertising campaigns 
modulating across three screens – cross-
device[s] – namely via mobile devices, 
through home screens, but also through 
public screens. We have established 
ourselves in this part of the market over 
a very long period and we are now trying 
to digitize it further. 


00:03:34 
C. Sch. 


Das 2. Thema, damit haben wir so vor 
eineinhalb Jahren begonnen, ist uns 
intensiver mit "Content" zu 
beschäftigen, und am Ende den 
"Traffic", der dadurch auf digitalen 
Assets entsteh. Also bei uns sind 
mittlerweile Portale wie T-Online, 
Giga, Kino.de, Spieletipps – zuletzt 
haben wir auch Statista übernommen, 
die sozusagen Statistik-Content – aber 
eben nicht werbefinanziert aufgleisen, 
sondern über Subscription-Modell.  


The 2nd field is one we began focusing 
on one and a half years ago, when we 
decided to deal more intensively with 
"content" and also with the "traffic" thus 
arising from our digital assets. We now 
own portals like T-Online, Giga, 
Kino.de, Spieletipps – of late, we have 
also taken over Statista, who of course 
deal in statistical content – but these are 
not financed by advertising, but through 
a subscription model. 


00:03:59 
C. Sch. 


Also, wenn man so will, kombinieren 
wir in der realen Welt ein 
Infrastrukturgeschäft und ein digitales – 
mit digitalen Assets in der Online-Welt, 
wo der Traffic entsteht, der sich auch 
wieder monetarisieren lässt. 


Let me put it this way: in the real world 
we are combining an infrastructure 
business with a digital one that has 
digital assets in the online world – where 
the traffic is created – which can again 
be monetized. 


00:04:11 
C. Sch. 


Und das machen wir auf zwei Ebenen – 
zum einen, in dem ganzen KMU-
Bereich. Also in kleinen, lokalen 
Märkten, wo wir in 40 Büros 
mittlerweile 800 Leute im 
Lokalvertrieb haben – 400 Outbound, 
400 Inbound – um Kunden sowohl 
Außenwerbeprodukte, als auch digitale 
zu verkaufen. Kunden, die vielleicht 
historisch gar nicht geworben haben, 
oder einmal im Jahr eine Anzeige im 
Wochenblatt geschalten haben, werden 
von uns besucht, und wir versuchen 
denen zu helfen, dass sie besser 
gefunden werden. Sowohl mit ihrer 
digitalen Präsenz, als auch am Ende mit 
ihrem Store oder Shop in der Stadt. 


And we do this on two levels – first of 
all, in the whole SME sector. We have 
small local markets where we now have 
800 people working in local distribution 
– 400 outbound, 400 inbound – in 40 
offices, to sell both outdoor advertising 
products and digital products to our 
customers. Customers, who maybe never 
advertised at all, or maybe only placed 
one ad in the Wochenblatt once a year, 
now pay us a visit, and we try to help 
them so the people can find them more 
easily. This means increasing their 
digital presence, and in the end helping 
their store or shop in the city. 


00:04:51 Das vierte Feld ist "Nationale The 4th field is "National Marketing". I 


Page 44 of 62
C. Sch. Vermarktung". Das ist glaube ich das, 
was zum Teil am Präsentesten ist, dass 
wir für Agenturen nationale Werbung 
betreibende Angebote haben. Historisch 
– wir haben Außenwerbebereich, 
mittlerweile eben auch Online-Bereich, 
das ist ein wichtiges Feld, was aber 
eben auch funktioniert in vielerlei 
Hinsicht, weil es in Kombination steht 
zu den ersten drei Gezeigten. 


think this has partially become the most 
prominent at present – the fact that we 
offer agencies advertising deals in the 
national market. Historically speaking, 
we have the outdoor advertising sector –
in the meantime also the online sector, 
which is an important area – but it really 
only works so well in so many ways, 
because it is used in combination with 
the aforementioned three fields. 


00:05:14 
C. Sch. 


Und weil wir schon auch merkten – das 
haben wir im Online-Bereich gespürt – 
Du kannst auch, selbst wenn Du als 
Firma nicht superviel Knowhow in 
einer bestimmten Kategorie hast – 
wenn einmal eine disruptive digitale 
Welle in ein bestimmtes Marktsegment 
kommt, muss es nicht immer so sein, 
dass die historischen stärksten Markt-
Player plötzlich das Rennen gewinnen. 
Sondern es kann auch mal ein 
Außenseiter eine wirklich wichtige 
Rolle spielen. 


And because we also realized – we 
became aware of this while working in 
the online sector – even if your company 
doesn't have a lot of expertise in a 
particular category, and a disruptive 
digital wave hits a particular market 
segment, it is not always true that the 
historically strongest market players 
suddenly win the race. It can indeed 
happen that an outsider can play a very 
significant role. 


00:05:38 
C. Sch. 


Wir hatten zumindest das Gefühl, wenn 
Du – wie Phillip [Westermann Meyer] 
gesagt hat – ein bisschen Eier hast, 
kannst Du auch als Außenwerber im 
Online-Bereich ein bisschen 
aufräumen. Und wir glauben, es gibt 
vielleicht auch andere Bereiche im 
Markt, wo nicht primär historisches 
Knowhow wichtig ist, sondern, die 
Veränderung zu erkennen und als 
Firma einfach dynamisch aufgestellt zu 
sein, und in der Lage zu sein, auch 
Risiken einzugehen. 


At least we came away with this 
impression. If – as Phillip [Westermann 
Meyer] has pointed out – you have the 
balls, you can make an impact on the 
online field, even as an outdoor 
advertiser. And we believe there may 
also be other areas in the market, where 
historical expertise is not primarily 
important, but rather the ability to detect 
change, to be set up dynamically as a 
company, and to be in a position where 
you can allow yourself to take risks. 


00:06:01 
C. Sch. 


Deswegen investieren wir zum Beispiel 
in Firmen, die noch keiner so kennt, 
wie Conexus – das ist der Marktführer 
in Skandinavien für e-Education. Ich 
glaube der Scott [Galloway] hatte 
vorher auch erzählt, dass das ein sehr 
interessanter Wachstumsmarkt sein 
kann. Wo wir einfach versuchen, in 
Bereichen, wo wir gute Leute finden, 
gute Firmen auch zu investieren und zu 


That's why we are, for example, 
investing in companies not many people 
know, such as Conexus, the market 
leader in Scandinavia for e-Education. I 
think Scott [Galloway] was saying 
earlier, that this can be a very interesting 
growth market. In areas where we can 
find good people, we are also trying to 
find good companies and investments, to 
see if they might allow us to develop a 


Page 45 of 62
sehen, ob sich daraus vielleicht ein 
sechstes, ein siebtes Geschäftsfeld 
entwickeln lässt. 


sixth, a seventh business field. 


00:06:29 
C. Sch. 


Was wir oft gefragt werden, ist: "Wenn 
Ihr so viele Firmen übernehmt, wie löst 
Ihr die Themen mit der Integration?" 
Und ich habe da bei Vine(?) ein Video 
gefunden, was unseren 
Integrationsprozess eigentlich ganz gut 
beschreibt. Da kommt irgendwo eine 
neue Firma her – klar, muss integriert 
werden – Schwupp! Ist sie integriert. 
Und dann geht das Geschäft einfach 
weiter. Es ist eigentlich gar nicht so 
komplex, wenn man nicht versucht, 
Post-Merger-Integrations aufzusetzen, 
mit Beratern, komplexe Strukturen und 
Prozesse, sondern einfach schaut, wie 
kriege ich neuen Firmen am besten 
geholfen, und wie kriege ich die dann 
entsprechend weiterentwickelt? 


We are often asked the question, "If you 
take over so many companies, how do 
you deal with issues of integration?" 
And I have stumbled across a video on 
Vine (?) that actually gives quite a good 
impression of our integration process. A 
new company comes along from 
somewhere; we obviously have to 
integrate it; and – hey presto! – it is part 
of our company. And business continues 
as usual. It is actually not that complex, 
unless you try to arrange post-merger 
integrations, with consultants, complex 
structures and processes; but if you 
simply focus on the best way to help out 
new companies, and come up with good 
solutions to get them developed 
accordingly, it can work. 


00:07:09 
C. Sch. 


Nicht immer ist nur Struktur und 
Prozess entscheidend, sondern so ein 
bisschen kreative Anarchie führt im 
Digital-Bereich aus unserer Sicht hier 
und da auch ganz gut zum Erfolg. Und 
insofern glaube ich, wird im Kontext 
von klassischen Medienunternehmen 
sehr, sehr häufig über digitale 
Transformation geredet. Wenn ich 
versuche unseren Ansatz zu 
beschreiben – es ist glaube ich gar nicht 
so sehr Transformation, sondern eher 
Transaktion. 


Structure and process aren't always the 
most critical points; from our point of 
view, a little bit of creative anarchy can 
also lead towards success in the digital 
area every now and then. And I also 
think in the context of traditional media 
companies there is very, very often also 
talk about digital transformations. If I 
were to try and describe our approach – I 
think it is not so much transformation, 
but rather transaction. 


00:07:33 
C. Sch. 


Du musst einfach was machen, loslegen 
und Dir dann überlegen, wo Du hin 
willst. Aber alles andere hat sehr viel 
mit dem "doing" zu tun. Theorie ist 
immer ein interessanter Teil, aber nicht 
der alleine entscheidende. Du musst es 
am Ende machen, und das glaube ich, 
ist im Digitalbereich wichtiger, als alles 
andere. Deswegen glaube ich, kommt 
man auch ganz gut mit Start-Up 
Kulturen, mit kleineren Unternehmen, 
klar. 


You just have to do something, get 
started and then think about where you 
want to go. But everything else evolves 
around the actual "doing". Theory is 
always an interesting part, but it doesn't 
determine the outcome on its own. In the 
end, you have to just do it; and I think 
that in the digital domain this is more 
important than anything else. That's why 
I think you can do very well with start-
up cultures, with smaller companies. 


Page 46 of 62
00:07:56 
C. Sch. 


Und, ja, wir versuchen das 
Unternehmen, so gut es geht, in den 
fünf skizzierten Feldern auch 
weiterzuentwickeln. 


And, yes, we are trying to further 
develop the company, as much as 
possible, within the five fields I've 
outlined for you. 


00:08:04 
P. W. M. 


Vielen Dank, ja. Nicht so schlecht. 
Du hast uns jetzt, glaube ich, noch 
nicht gesagt – um das noch einmal zu 
erwähnen, ich weiß nicht, inwieweit 
das wirklich korreliert, aber – als Du 
zu Ströer dazugekommen bist, da 
war glaube ich die 
Marktkapitalisierung bei ungefähr 
300 Millionen, und heute ist sie bei 
2,8 Milliarden. Irgendwie, ganz 
falsch kann das nicht sein, was Du so 
erzählst, offensichtlich. 


Thank you, yes. That doesn't sound 
too bad. I think you haven't told us yet 
– just to mentioning it again – I don't 
know how far it really correlates, but 
– when you joined Ströer, their 
market capitalization was, as I recall, 
about 300 million. But today it is 2.8 
billion. Obviously, some of the things 
you say can't be that far-fetched. 


00:08:24 
C. Sch. 


Ja, oder ich weiß nicht, was ich tue, und 
war einfach nur glücklicherweise zum 
richtigen Zeitpunkt am richtigen Fleck, 
aber... [Lacht] 


Yes, or I have no clue of what I'm doing, 
and I just luckily found myself in the 
right place, at the right time, but ... 
[Laughs] 


00:08:30 
P. W. M 


Vielleicht nur das. Maybe it's just that. 


00:08:31 
C. Sch. 


...aber manchmal merkst Du auch – 
man darf nicht so sehr darauf schauen, 
wo Du vielleicht gerade stehst, sondern 
was Du als Potential hast. Und ich 
glaube, Ströer hat über 20, 25 Jahre 
einfach im Außenwerbebereich, 
eigentlich im Gesamtmarkt, eine 
Position aufgebaut – die war immer 
viel, viel mehr Wert, als EUR 3 
Millionen. Ich glaube, die letzten 3 
Jahre haben nur mehr Menschen, oder 
Investoren und Anleger, auch erkannt, 
dass es tatsächlich so ist. 


...but sometimes you also realize – you 
can't just focus on where you are right 
now, but you also have to take into 
account your potential. As I recall, Ströer 
has been establishing a position for itself 
for over 20, 25 years – not just in the 
outdoor advertising area, but in the 
overall market. And this position has 
always been worth way, way more than 
EUR 3 million. I think during the last 3 
years more people, or shareholders and 
investors, have started to see the 
company's potential. 


00:08:57 
P. W. M 


Aber die ganzen Anleger, die das alle 
so sehen – die dürften jetzt zum 
Beispiel nicht Scott Galloway 
zuhören. Wenn man mal dem folgt, 
dann ist ja für euch der Ofen mehr 
oder weniger bald aus. Weil nur noch 
Google und Facebook da unterwegs 
sind, oder die anderen bei 
einander(?). 


But all the investors who think that 
way – well, they'd better not listen to 
what Scott Galloway, or someone like 
him, has to say. If you believe what 
they say is true, then the fire won't be 
burning much longer for companies 
like yours. Because only Google and 
Facebook will be alive then, or maybe 
some other players(?). 


00:09:11 
C. Sch. 


Ja, gut. [Lacht] Da kann ich nur sagen, 
"In the long run, we are all dead." Also, 


Yes, well. [Laughs] I can only reply, "In 
the long run, we are all dead." But the 


Page 47 of 62
die Frage ist ja nur – wenn ich 
langfristig ohnehin tot bin, wie gestalte 
ich denn die Strecke bis dahin? Und da 
sagen wir, "Wir machen lieber mal 
ordentlich Rabatz und schauen, ob nicht 
doch irgendetwas möglich ist." 
[Applaus] 


question remains – although I know I'll 
be dead soon anyway – how do I make 
use of the time I have left? And here we 
say, "We prefer to kick up a fuss just to 
make sure we've exceeded all 
possibilities." [Applause] 


00:09:33 
C. Sch. 


Aber... [Applaus] wenn man genau auf 
das schaut, was wir machen, glaube ich, 
suchen wir uns schon Felder aus, die 
eben nicht so einfach angreifbar sind 
durch große in der USA-sitzende Tech-
orientierte Unternehmen. Weil – ich 
glaube nicht, dass Google und 
Facebook Lokalvertriebe in 
Deutschland aufbauen werden. Ja, ich 
weiß auch nicht, ob beide Firmen 
Interesse haben, jedes Geschäft im 
nationalen Werbemarkt zu machen. Ich 
glaube auch, dass Sprache und Kultur 
in dem Content- und Publishing-
Bereich eine wichtige Rolle spielen. 


But... [Applause] if you take a closer 
look at what we do, I think we are 
choosing fields that are not likely to be 
attacked by large US-based, tech-
oriented companies. Because I don't 
think that Google and Facebook will 
introduce local distributors in Germany. 
And I also don't know if these two 
companies are even interested in 
conducting each and every business on 
the national advertising market. I also 
believe that language and culture play an 
important role in the area of content and 
publishing. 


00:10:03 
C. Sch. 


Und dass es NUR noch globale 
Plattformen gibt – da glaube ich am 
Ende auch nicht daran, und von daher 
ist überhaupt keine Frage, dass die 
Firmen immer stärker werden. Aber 
jenseits der Firmen gibt es genug 
Marktsegmente, die für die nicht 
relevant sind, und wir versuchen uns 
auf die zu konzentrieren. Aber wir 
wollen auch eigene Entscheidungen 
treffen. Und ich glaube, einfach immer 
nur sich vor den Großen ins Höschen 
zu machen, ist eine schlechte Strategie. 
Dann ist der Weg hin zum Sterben 
ziemlich langweilig, ja. [Applaus] 


And that ONLY global platforms will 
exist in the future – I have a hard time 
believing that one, too. But of course 
there is no doubt that these companies 
will become stronger in their field. There 
are plenty of market segments that are 
not relevant for Google and Facebook. 
Those are the ones we are trying to focus 
on. We want to make our own decisions; 
just wetting our panties because of the 
big players is a bad strategy. Then the 
road that leads to death is really rather 
boring, yes. [Applause] 


00:10:36 
F. H. 


Vielleicht... [Applaus] Christian, eine 
Frage, die den Markt so ein bisschen 
bewegt – man hört, Ihr baut sehr viel 
an eigener Technologie. Wäre einmal 
sehr interessant zu verstehen – auch 
von dem, was Scott Galloway gesagt 
hat, versucht er ja wirklich ein Full-
Stack Adtech-Anbieter zu werden – 
vermutlich nein, aber was ist 


Maybe... [Applause] Christian, one 
question has been making its way 
across the market – rumor has it you 
are building quite a lot of your own 
technology. So it would be very 
interesting to understand – also 
because Scott Galloway said he is 
really trying to be a full-stack ad tech 
provider – that's probably not your 


Page 48 of 62
sozusagen Eure Überlegung? Wieso 
baut Ihr Technologie, und was für 
Technologie ist das, und wieso glaubt 
Ihr, dass Ihr das braucht, um sagen 
wir einmal, in der Google-Facebook-
Welt zu überleben? Also, ich glaube, 
es wäre für viele hilfreich einmal 
Eure Überlegungen zu verstehen. 


goal, but what are your thoughts on 
this matter? Why are you building 
technologies; and what kinds of 
technologies are you building, and 
why do you think you need all of this 
to, let's say survive in the Google-
Facebook world? I just think it would 
be helpful for many people to 
understand your motivation. 


00:11:05 
C. Sch. 


Naja gut, ich glaube, wir sind kein 
Adtech-Unternehmen. Wir haben auch 
keine Adtech-DNA, und wir wollen es 
auch gar nicht werden. Aber ich glaube, 
wir haben eine Vermarktungs-, 
Vertriebs- und Monetarisierungs-DNA. 
Und da merkst Du eben, dass heute – 
auch durch Digitalisierung – das Thema 
Technologie und Daten eine wichtige 
Rolle spielt. Ich glaube, manche 
Themen in der Vermarktung kannst Du 
nur glaubwürdig und sinnvoll lösen, 
wenn Du auch ein paar Leute hast, die 
davon etwas verstehen. Und wir 
glauben halt, dass jenseits von globalen 
Standardlösungen – sowohl für 
Publisher, zum Beispiel, aber auch für 
Werbungtreibende – wirklich 
individualisierte Themen immer 
wichtiger werden. 


Well, actually, I don't think we are an ad 
tech company. We also don't have an ad 
tech DNA, and that isn't our goal either. 
But I think we have a marketing, 
distribution and monetization DNA. And 
you just come to realize that nowadays – 
but also because of the digitization – 
technology and information play a very 
important role. I think there are some 
issues in marketing where you can only 
find credible and sensible solutions, if 
you also employ a few people, who have 
a clear understanding of the subject 
matter. It is our belief that these lie 
beyond global standard solutions – both 
for publishers, for example, but also for 
advertisers – and that truly 
individualized solutions are becoming 
more and more important. 


00:11:41 
C. Sch. 


Und da merken wir halt, wenn wir in so 
eine Richtung gehen, liefern uns... naja, 
die Tech-Lösungen von globalen 
Unternehmen nicht immer konsistent 
das, was wir brauchen. Von daher 
wollen wir nicht wirklich mit denen 
konkurrieren, sondern in bestimmten 
Bereichen einfach hinreichend gute, auf 
uns zugeschnittene Lösungen haben, 
die es uns erlauben, einfach unser 
Geschäft besser zu betreiben. Und wir 
sind natürlich auch in einer Schnittlinie, 
zum Beispiel zwischen Außenwerbung 
und Online, und bauen – gerade auch 
mit einem kanadischen Unternehmen – 
an einer SSP-Lösung für unsere digitale 
Außenwerbung. Das wird gerade auch 


And we've come to realize while we 
were pursuing these problems... well, 
that the tech solutions offered by global 
enterprises don't always consistently 
provide us with what we need. So we 
don't really want to compete with them; 
in certain areas we are simply trying to 
provide sufficiently good solutions that 
are tailored to fix our problems and 
simply allow us to go about our business 
in a more efficient way. But we are 
naturally also creating an interface, for 
example, between outdoor advertising 
and the online sphere, and we are 
currently developing –in collaboration 
with a Canadian company – a SSP 
solution for our digital outdoor

advertising. This is just being hooked up 
to the first agency online trading desks. 


00:12:19 
F. H. 


Wie lange dauert das noch, bis jetzt 
sozusagen das Start-Up draußen 
Ströer-Außenwerbung per DSP 
buchen kann? 


How long will it take until the start-up 
can book Ströer outdoor advertising 
via DSP? 


00:12:25 
C. Sch. 


Ich glaube, dass wir im 2. Quartal so 
weit sind, die ersten Sachen zu starten 
und ich glaube, das sind alles Dinge, 
die entstehen gerade erst. Und die 
möchten wir – weil wir auf vielen 
zentralen Assets sind, die wir auch voll 
kontrollieren – schon auch ein Stück 
weit mitgestalten. Weil wir auch genug 
davon verstehen, dass wir vielleicht 
eine bessere und individualisiertere 
Lösung finden, als jetzt ein globales 
Tech-Unternehmen, das ohne Zweifel 
endlos viel mehr Entwickler hat. Nur, 
das Thema bei uns spielt für die auch 
eine endlos kleine Rolle. Und damit 
muss man irgendwo auch sehen, wie 
man umgeht. 


I think it will be as early as in the second 
quarter, when the first products will be 
made available, and I think these are all 
things that are just now starting to 
develop. And – because we have many 
key assets we fully control – we do want 
to be able to also shape their 
development. Also, because we have a 
good enough understanding and might 
find a better and more individualized 
solution than a global tech company, 
although they no doubt have endlessly 
more developers. But the solution we are 
looking for is of an endlessly lower 
priority to them than it is for us. So you 
have to find some way to deal with this 
issue. 


00:13:00 
C. Sch. 


Heißt aber eben nicht, dass wir wirklich 
ernsthaft überlegen, wie muss ich mich 
technologisch gegen Google und 
Facebook aufstellen? Ich glaube, das 
macht dann keinen Sinn. Sondern zu 
sehen, wo hören deren 
Geschäftsmodelle auf und wie kann ich 
mich da sinnvoll orientieren? 


But, as I said before, this doesn't mean 
we are seriously thinking about finding 
ways in which we can technologically 
challenge Google and Facebook. I don't 
think that would make much sense. 
Instead, we take a look at where their 
business models end and contemplate 
how we can place ourselves in a way that 
makes sense. 


00:13:15 
P. W. M. 


Was mich interessieren würde ist – 
also, jetzt habt Ihr ja eine Menge 
Akquisitionen- 


What would interest me is – well, 
you've made quite a lot of 
acquisitions- 


00:13:20 
C. Sch. 


Ein Scheiß Platz hier – ich muss mich 
hier dauernd hin- und her drehen. 


This is a shitty place – I always have to 
swivel my chair back and forth here. 


00:13:22 
P. W. M. 


(Lacht) Ja. Jetzt habt Ihr eine Menge 
Akquisitionen gemacht und es gibt so 
die Legende im Markt, dass Euer 
größter Shareholder, der Udo 
Müller, so ein bisschen über die 
Veranstaltung geht – bei uns 
vielleicht, gestern über die IMAX 
oder so, und so kuckt, "Ach, das sind 
coole Firmen, die kaufen wir mal." 


(Laughs) Yes. You've made quite a lot 
of acquisitions and there's a legend 
making its way around the market 
that your biggest shareholder, Udo 
Müller, is walking through the event 
area – maybe he was right here with 
us yesterday, when IMAX was here, 
and he says to himself, "Oh lookie 
here – these are all really cool 


Page 50 of 62
Macht einen roten Punkt an den 
Stand, damit die nachher gekauft 
werden – Live-Shopping, sozusagen, 
[Publikum lacht] auf der Messe. Und 
dann musst Du nachher dann sehen, 
dass Du mit den ganzen Firmen klar 
kommst (Lacht). 


companies; I think we'll buy them!" 
So he sticks a red dot on the sales 
booths, so they'll be bought up at a 
later date – live shopping, so to speak 
– [Audience laughs] at the fair. And 
later, you have to make sure you get 
along with all those companies 
(Laughs). 


00:13:47 
P. W. M. 


A) Wie schafft man das kulturell? 
Und vielleicht noch ein zweites 
Insight, was ich gestern Abend 
gehört habe, da war ich total 
überrascht... Wir waren ja 
gemeinsam Abendessen und dann 
bist Du nach Hause gefahren. Wir 
standen dann beide draußen bei den 
Fahrern, und dann hast Du zum 
Fahrer gesagt: "Ich muss zum Motel 
One". Und da dachte ich, "Habe ich 
mich jetzt gerade verhört, oder fährt 
der Kollege Schmalzl jetzt wirklich 
ins Motel One?" Und das war dann 
wohl so. Und also, diese Kultur... 
jetzt kommt da eine neue Firmen 
rein, da kauft ihr schon mal relativ 
wild dazu, und dann – muss man da 
einfach den Gründern dann auch 
verkaufen, dass die dann auch im 
Motel One übernachten sollen, oder 
wie macht man so etwas? Wie schafft 
man so eine Kultur? 


A) How do you do that culturally? 
And perhaps also a second insight... I 
heard something last night that totally 
surprised me... We had dinner 
together and then you drove home. 
We were both outside with the drivers, 
and then you said to the driver, "I'm 
staying at the Motel One". And I 
thought to myself, "Are my ears 
playing tricks on me, or is my 
colleague Mr. Schmalzl really driving 
to the Motel One?" And I guess that's 
what happened. So this culture... you 
bring in this new company, you're 
making new acquisitions left, right 
and center, and then – do you have to 
persuade the founders to also stay at 
the Motel One, or how does that 
happen? How do you create such a 
culture? 


00:14:23 
C. Sch. 


Naja, ich glaube, diese Kultur kriegst 
Du heute nicht mehr von oben nach 
unten verordnet. Ich glaube, das ist 
auch die Schwierigkeit von großen 
Unternehmen, die versuchen so 
Corporate Structures am Leben zu 
erhalten, in einer Welt, die sich auch 
durch Digitalisierung ändert. Ich 
glaube, man muss sich genau überlegen 
als Firma, welchen Sinn hat es, wenn 
sich alle total konform verhalten? Ich 
glaube, es gibt ein paar Basics, die 
müssen irgendwo eingehalten werden, 
aber jenseits davon, glaube ich, ist es 
wichtig, dass Du einfach die 


Well, I don't think that this kind of 
culture is passed down from the top to 
the bottom nowadays. I think this is one 
of the difficulties large companies face, 
when they try to maintain a specific 
corporate structures in a world that is 
changing – also through digitization. 
You have to ask yourself as a company, 
"Does it really make sense for everyone 
to behave in exactly the same fashion?" I 
think there are a few basics that have to 
be respected, one way or another, but 
when it goes beyond that, I think it's 
important that you just make use of the 
individual strengths of different people – 


Page 51 of 62
individuellen Stärken unterschiedlicher 
Leute – aber auch unterschiedlicher 
Firmen – nutzt. 


but also of different companies. 


00:14:57 
C. Sch. 


Ja, wenn es die Leute zu bunt treiben – 
klar, muss man ein bisschen eingreifen. 
Aber bei dem Tempo, zum Beispiel, 
das wir im Akquise-Bereich haben, 
kannst Du gar nicht den Anspruch 
haben, eine römische Armee 
aufzubauen. Ich weiß auch gar nicht, ob 
eine römische Armee in einem digitalen 
Zeitalter wirklich erfolgreich sein kann, 
weil Du merkst, die Märkte verändern 
sich so schnell, dass Du sehr flexible 
Einheiten brauchst. 


Of course, if the people go too far, you 
have to draw them back in line. For 
instance, at the pace we've been keeping 
throughout all our acquisitions, you can't 
realistically expect to build a Roman 
army. I'm also not entirely sure, if a 
Roman army can truly be successful in a 
digital age, because you realize that 
markets are changing so fast that you 
need to have very flexible units. 


00:15:20 
C. Sch. 


Du musst vielleicht morgen auch das 
wieder über den Haufen werfen, was 
Du gestern erst entschieden hast. Ich 
glaube, Schwärme sind da zum Teil 
anpassungsfähiger als so römische 
Legionen, weil die sich schneller auf 
neue Situationen einstellen können. 
Und ich glaube, das gilt auch für eine 
Kultur – man muss einfach akzeptieren, 
dass eine Firma nicht mehr komplett 
uniform organisiert ist, weil in unserem 
Fall die Leute auch sehr, sehr 
unterschiedliche Dinge machen. Also, 
jemand, der sich mit dem Bekleben von 
Litfaßsäulen beschäftigt, der hat andere 
Probleme, als jemand, der an einem 
RGA-Stack baut. 


Maybe tomorrow you'll have to go back 
to square one on an issue you thought 
you'd solved only yesterday. I think 
swarms are perhaps more adaptable than 
Roman legions, because they can quickly 
readjust to cope with new situations. 
And I think the same is true for a culture 
– you just have to accept that a company 
can no longer be organized in a 
completely uniform way, because in our 
case we have a lot of different people 
working in a lot of different areas. 
Someone who goes around plastering 
signs on advertising pillars has other 
problems as someone who is busy 
building RGA stacks. 


00:15:51 
C. Sch. 


Und jemand, der als Betreuer jemanden 
in der Stadtverwaltung hat – weil wir 
da den Werbevertrag halten – der tickt 
ganz anders. Neulich hatte sich jemand 
aus einer Kommune bei mir beschwert, 
weil schon wieder die Ansprechpartner 
wechseln. Der nette Herr war, glaube 
ich, 61 – und dann habe ich dem 
gesagt: "Ja, wo ist jetzt das Problem?" 
Da hat er gesagt, er ist jetzt seit 30 
Jahren in dem Job in der Gemeinde und 
jetzt hat er vom Ströer doch allen 
Ernstes zum dritten Mal eine neue 
Person vorgestellt gekriegt – in 31 


And someone with a supervisor, who is 
working in the city administration – 
because we have advertising contracts 
with them – also works in a completely 
different way. The other day, someone 
from a municipality came to me and 
complained that their contact person was 
changing – yet again. The nice 
gentleman was, I think, 61 years old, and 
I said to him, "So where's the problem?" 
And he replied he'd been working for the 
municipality for 30 years now and the 
Ströer company had had the audacity to 
introduce a new person for the third time 


Page 52 of 62
Jahren. in a row – and that in 31 years. 
00:16:23 
C. Sch. 


Ja, die Onliner sagen mir, in eineinhalb 
Jahren kann ich irgendwo was Neues 
machen, mir wird's langsam langweilig, 
also... Wie soll eine einheitliche Kultur 
dafür aussehen? Du kannst immer nur 
schauen, dass entsprechend der 
jeweiligen Firmenbereiche das so 
strukturiert ist, dass es Sinn macht. Und 
du musst damit leben, dass Menschen 
eben unterschiedlich sind. Ich glaube, 
das als Grundkulturprinzip kann dann 
auch funktionieren. 


The online-workers are telling me they'll 
be gone in one and a half years – I'm 
getting bored here, I want to do 
something else, so... How should a 
uniform culture look like for such a 
company? You can only make sure that 
the way you have structured things is 
making sense according to the relevant 
company departments. And you just 
have to live with the fact that people are 
different. I think if you follow this basic 
cultural principle, it can work out. 


00:16:47 
F. H. 


Eine Frage, die mich so ein bisschen 
umtreibt: Also, Ihr versucht zum Teil 
Technologieanbieter zu sein, zum 
Teil läuft eine sehr Sales-lastige 
DNA, und dann besitzt Ihr auch 
Content-Seiten. Google besitzt keine 
Content-Seiten – wieso macht Ihr 
das? Also, Ihr kauft ja 
Erdbeerlounge, und was auch immer, 
regelmäßig Content-Seiten dazu – 
was ist die Überlegung, wieso glaubt 
Ihr, dass Ihr das braucht? 


Here's a question that has been 
haunting me a little: So, to some extent 
you try to be a technology provider, 
partly you have a very sales-heavy 
DNA, and then you also have content 
pages. Google does not own any 
content pages – so why do you? You 
are forever buying new content pages, 
things like Erdbeerlounge, and all 
those others, – what is the reason 
behind all this? Why do you think you 
need all this? 


00:17:09 
C. Sch. 


Also, ich glaube, mit einer reinen 
Drittvermarktung kann es manchmal 
schwer sein, langfristig auch immer 
wieder die richtigen Entscheidungen zu 
treffen. Wir glauben einfach, dass es 
schon in der Entwicklung von 
Werbelösungen super hilfreich ist, 
wenn Du – zumindest in Teilen – auch 
selber Publisher bist und vermarktest. 
Man merkt bei so Themen wie Native 
Advertising – auch bei der Frage, wie 
gehe ich mit Ad-Blocking um – haben 
eigentlich Publisher und Vermarkter 
zum Teil ähnliche Aufgabenstellungen, 
wenn sie die gemeinsam lösen, kommst 
Du deutlich schneller weiter. 


Well, I think if you only have third-party 
marketing it can sometimes be difficult, 
in the long term, to always make the 
right decisions. We simply believe that it 
is really helpful for the development of 
advertising solutions that you are – at 
least partly – also your own publisher 
and can put your product on the market. 
You can tell with such topics as "native 
advertising" – also when you are 
wondering how to deal with issues such 
as ad blocking – publishers and 
marketers actually often have partly 
similar tasks, and when they solve them 
together, your development is much 
faster. 


00:17:44 
C. Sch. 


Das ist neben Margen-Gesichtspunkten 
somit eine unserer Überlegungen. Weil, 
wenn Du nur ein reiner Drittvermarkter 
bist, ist es natürlich viel, viel 
schwieriger, überall auch zusätzlich die 


In addition to margin viewpoints, this is 
also one of our considerations. Because 
if you're purely a third-party marketer it 
is of course much, much harder to also 
make additional investments in other 


Page 53 of 62
Investition zu tätigen. Wenn Du aber 
das, was Du investieren musst, an der 
Schnittstelle im Prinzip nur einmal 
machst, aber von der Publisher- und 
Vermarkter-Seite nutzen kannst – das 
ist etwas, das aus unserer Sicht Sinn 
macht. 


areas. So, if you have something than 
can be used by both the publisher and the 
marketer, and you only have to invest in 
this project one time at the interface – 
then that is something that makes sense 
from our point of view. 


00:18:08 
C. Sch. 


Es gibt aber eben auch noch die 
Überlegung, dass wir auf unseren 
Public Screens auch mehr und mehr 
Inhalte zeigen, weil wir eben sehen, 
dass nur Werbung dort weniger gut 
funktioniert. Dass, wenn Du auch 
Inhalte mit Werbung kombinierst – 
wenn ich Inhalte schon auf digitalen – 
also auf Online-Assets – herstelle, kann 
ich die natürlich super auch auf Public 
Screens nutzen. Und da versuchen wir 
einfach in allen Bereichen auch so in 
der Gegend zu finden, uns so 
diversifiziert aufzustellen, dass wir 
gerade auch gegen globale Player nicht 
so einfach angreifbar sind. 


But there is also the consideration that 
we could show more and more content 
on our public screens if we get the 
impression that only advertising isn't 
really working in certain areas. That if 
you combine content with advertising – 
if I'm already producing digital content – 
that is to say online assets – I can of 
course also use them on public screens. 
So we are trying to establish ourselves in 
multiple ways in both business and also 
local areas, to ensure we aren't easy 
targets for the global players. 


00:18:38 
C. Sch. 


Hätten wir nur Inventar, wären wir in 
einer ganz anderen 
Konkurrenzsituation, zum Beispiel mit 
Firmen wie Google. Hätten wir nur 
Publisher-Themen, hätten wir in der 
Vermarktung vielleicht da und dort 
andere Probleme, oder in der Art, wie 
wir Traffic absichern. Und da glauben 
wir, ist die Aufstellung, die wir 
gefunden haben, eigentlich für unser 
Geschäft eine relativ sinnvolle. 


If we only had assets, we would be in a 
completely different competitive 
situation with, for example, companies 
such as Google. If we only had work in 
the line of publishing, we might have 
other problems in the area of marketing 
now and then, or in the way we protect 
traffic. Therefore we believe that the 
arrangements we have made so far are 
pretty suitable for our line of business. 


00:18:58 
F. H. 


Und Ihr wollt ja noch tiefer in die 
Wirtschaft vor – E-Commerce macht 
Ihr demnächst, das freut mich 
natürlich sehr. Es gibt ja nicht viele, 
die sich hereinwagen in den Bereich 
gerade, also, von den neuen Spielern. 
Was ist da zu erwarten? 


And you want to proceed even deeper 
into the economy – I hear you'll be 
conducting e-commerce in the near 
future, and naturally, I'm pretty 
pleased about this. There are not 
many who dare to enter into this area; 
especially the new players are very 
reluctant. So what can we expect from 
you? 


00:19:09 
C. Sch. 


Also, ich glaube, E-Commerce greift 
wahrscheinlich ein bisschen zu weit – 
wir versuchen halt zu verstehen, wie 


Well, I think calling it "e-commerce" is 
probably taking things a little too far – 
we are just trying to understand how we 


Page 54 of 62
wir den Traffic auf unseren Traffic-
Assets bestmöglich monetarisieren 
können. Und wenn ich feststelle, dass 
ich auf einem bestimmten Portal 
unheimlich viele Affiliate-Erlöse aus 
dem Gaming-Bereich habe – wenn ich 
dann feststelle, also Gaming-
Accessories, da gibt's extrem gute 
Margen – da kann ich vielleicht einmal 
darüber nachdenken, ob es Sinn macht, 
nicht nur die Affiliate-Kohle 
mitzunehmen, sondern auch ein Stück 
weit tiefer in die entsprechende 
Wertschöpfung hinein zu gehen. 


can best monetize the traffic on our 
traffic assets. And if I realize that I have 
an awfully large affiliate revenue from 
the gaming area on a specific portal – 
and thus conclude that gaming 
accessories have extremely good 
margins – I can maybe think about 
whether it wouldn't be smart to not only 
take away the money I make from the 
affiliates, but to go a little deeper into the 
respective net value added. 


00:19:44 
C. Sch. 


Insofern, E-Commerce per se ist glaube 
ich ein Thema, das man sich sehr, sehr 
vorsichtig anschauen muss. 


I do think that e-commerce in itself is an 
issue that has to be handled very, very 
carefully. 


00:19:49 
P. W. M. 


Schmerzhaft. Painfully. 


00:19:52 
C. Sch 


[Lacht] Aber ausgehend von den 
Assets, die man halt wirklich in 
bestimmten Nischen – wo auch ein 
deutscher Mittelständler sehr gut sich 
bewegen kann – sich die raus zu 
picken, und das selektiv zu machen, wo 
es einfach im Gesamtkonstrukt Sinn 
macht – das ist schon etwas, das uns 
interessiert. Aus der Logik hat auch 
zum Beispiel eine Akquisition wie 
Statista für uns Sinn gemacht, ja, weil 
da passt das sehr gut rein. Und 
Subscription-Erlöse in Kombination 
mit eher kurzfristig getakteten 
Werbeerlösen; nationale 
Vermarktungserlöse mit wenigen 
Kunden, die große Tickets haben, 
kombiniert mit tausenden von kleinen 
Kunden lokal – ist einfach eine 
Mischung, die uns als Firma 
unabhängig macht, und die uns 
gleichzeitig den Spielraum auch gibt, 
nach vorne weiter aggressiv zu 
wachsen. 


[Laughs] But starting from the assets you 
can really find in certain niches – where 
even a German SME can move around 
pretty well – you can cherry-pick and be 
selective about what you want, with 
what goes well with your whole 
construct – that is indeed something we 
are interested in. The acquisition as 
Statista, for example, made sense to us 
for exactly the same reason, because it 
fits in really well with the rest of our 
framework. And subscription revenue in 
combination with more short-clocked 
advertising revenues; national marketing 
revenues with few customers who have 
large tickets, combined with thousands 
of small local customers – is simply a 
mixture that makes us independent as a 
company, and at the same time gives us 
enough leeway to continue to grow 
forward in an aggressive way. 


00:20:34 
P. W. M. 


Vielleicht noch ganz kurz vor Schluss 
– Sag einmal, jetzt habt Ihr viel 
gekauft – was war das Beste, das Ihr 


Perhaps, now that we are coming 
closer towards the end – Tell me, after 
all those acquisitions you've made – 


Page 55 of 62
gekauft habt? which one do you think is the best? 
00:20:40 
C. Sch. 


Also, irgendwie war alles super, aber... Well, in a way they were all really great, 
but ... 


00:20:43 
P. W. M.  


(lacht) Natürlich, natürlich. Immer. (Laughs) Of course, of course. I 
expected nothing else. 


00:20:45 
C. Sch. 


Also, ich glaube es ist schwer zu sagen. 
Ich persönlich glaube, der größte Wert 
unserer Firma steckt am Ende in dem, 
wo wir herkommen, und das ist 
sicherlich diese Außenwerbe-
Infrastruktur, aber es ist auch der lokale 
Markt, lokale Kunden – das KMU-
Geschäft. Wenn ich das als Basis 
nehme, glaube ich einfach, dass eine 
Akquisition wie zum Beispiel 
RegioHelden für uns super Sinn 
gemacht hat. Und wenn man vielleicht 
in 10 Jahren auf unser Geschäft schaut, 
wird man sagen, das war rückwirkend 
vielleicht wirklich eine der smartesten 
Akquisitionen, weil die bestehende 
lokale Vertriebsinfrastruktur aus dem 
Außenwerbebereich mit langjährigen 
Kundenbeziehungen optimal genutzt 
wurde, mit digitalen Produkten. 


Well, I think it's pretty hard to say. 
Personally, I think that in the end, the 
greatest value of our company lies in 
where we came from, and that is most 
definitely the outdoor advertising 
infrastructure, but it is also the local 
market, our local customers – the SME 
business. If I take that as a basis, I 
simply believe that an acquisition, such 
as for example RegioHelden, made a lot 
of sense for us. And if you were to look 
back on our business 10 years from now, 
you might say that retrospectively, this 
was perhaps really one of the smartest 
acquisitions we ever made, because the 
existing local distribution infrastructure 
from the outdoor advertising area, in 
combination with longstanding customer 
relationships, as well as digital products 
– was a great utilization of our resources. 


00:21:27 
C. Sch. 


Und wir genau das kombiniert haben, 
auch in der Akquisition, was Sinn 
macht – gute Produktleute – Digital 
Natives, die wirklich verstehen, wie Du 
mit dem richtigen Aufwand Dinge 
designst – aber eben kombiniert mit 
einer Flächenstrukturstärke, die wir als 
klassisches Unternehmen eingebracht 
haben. Aber das ist jetzt auch nur ein 
Beispiel von wahrscheinlich einigen. 
Man weiß eben oft erst hinterher, was 
rauskommt, aber ich glaube, das war 
sicherlich etwas, das insgesamt Sinn 
gemacht hat für uns. 


But also in regard to the acquisition we 
combined what makes sense – good 
product people – digital natives who 
really understand how to design things 
with the proper effort – but in 
combination with a strong infrastructure, 
which we were able to provide as a 
classical company. But this is only one 
out of a number of examples. Often you 
only know in retrospect, what the 
outcome will be, but I do believe that 
was certainly something that seemed like 
a good idea for the company in the long 
run. 


00:21:54 
P. W. M. 


Vielleicht gehen wir ganz kurz mal 
an die Bar. Michael? Hast Du etwas? 


Maybe we can briefly have a look at 
what's going on at the bar. Michael? 
Do you have something for us?

Gefühl, Ihr baut hier gerade so etwas

Yes, well – I am getting the impression 
you are building something like Yahoo

then they made thousands of

Deutschland werdet? 


acquisitions and now they are the 
main recruiting company for the 
Vendor 4 (??) What measures are you 
taking to prevent your company from 
becoming the main recruiting 
company for the Vendor 4 in 
Germany? 


00:22:17 
C. Sch. 


Wie bitte? I beg your pardon? 


00:22:17 
(Herr 1 
aus dem 
Publikum) 
(Gent. 1 
from the 
audience) 


Wie haltet Ihr Eure Leute? Die sind 
im Burn-Out irgendwann, Ihr kauft 
ihnen die Firmen ab – habt da so eine 
Tapete, da gehen die irgendwie unter 
– Philip hat es angesprochen. Was ist 
Eure Kultur, was ist Euer Belief, 
woran glaubt Ihr, außer, dass Ihr 
jetzt der größte Advertiser seid? 


How do you intend to hold your 
people? At some point, they'll all 
suffer from burn-out; you're buying 
up their companies – you put up some 
wallpaper and somehow they fall 
through the cracks – Philip has 
already addressed this issue. What is 
your culture; what is your belief; what 
is important to you, apart from being 
the biggest advertiser? 


00:22:32 
C. Sch. 


Also, Größe per se hat ja keinen Wert, 
aber ich glaube, es gibt drei Sachen, an 
denen vor allem junge Leute Spaß 
haben, die in dem digitalen Business 
unterwegs sind. Ich glaube, das erste ist 
Erfolg. Jeder, der hier ist, hat am Ende 
Bock, irgendwo erfolgreich zu sein und 
vielleicht mal hier mit dem Philip auf 
der Bühne zu sitzen. Ja, und in dem 
Moment, wo unsere Firma insgesamt 
erfolgreich ist, glaube ich, sind wir 
attraktiv in Summe. 


Well, just size alone has no value, but I 
think there are three points that are 
especially fun for young people working 
in the digital business. I think the first 
point is success. Everyone, who is here, 
is basically here because they want to be 
successful and maybe even sit up here on 
the stage and have a chat with Philip one 
day. Yes, and at that very moment, when 
our company is successful overall –that's 
when I think we are attractive as a 
whole. 


00:22:58 
C. Sch. 


Es ist eine interessante Plattform, wenn 
Du weißt, irgendwie wissen die, wie es 
geht – da kann ich mich wo andocken, 
wo Erfolg ist. Ich glaube das zweite ist, 
worauf junge Leute Bock haben, und 
gerade wenn man talentiert ist – 
Dynamik. Jeden Tag den gleichen 
Scheiß machen, da haben – je jünger 
die Leute werden, umso weniger Bock 
haben sie darauf. Ich glaube, wenn 
irgendeine Firma für Dynamik steht 
und auch dafür, dass man Mut zum 
Risiko hat, dann sind das wir. Also, ich 
glaube auch, das kreiert eine spezielle 
Kultur. Und das dritte ist – und das ist 


It is an interesting platform, if you know 
that the others somehow know how 
things are done – here's a business I can 
latch myself to and also make a profit. I 
think the second point that young people 
are drawn to – and especially those with 
a lot of talent – is dynamics. The 
younger the people, the less inclined 
they are to do the same shit day after 
day. I think if there's a company that has 
a reputation of being dynamic, of having 
the courage to take risks, then that 
company is us. And I also think that 
creates a special culture. And the third 
point is – and this is perhaps the biggest 


Page 57 of 62
vielleicht die größte Herausforderung 
für uns, und ich weiß gar nicht, ob wir 
da immer so super unterwegs sind – 
aber Du musst den Leuten halt die 
richtige Mischung aus 
Rahmenbedingungen und Strukturen 
geben. 


challenge for us, and I'm not sure if we 
are always able to provide this – you 
have to offer your employees just the 
right combination of framework 
conditions and structures. 


00:23:36 
C. Sch. 


Aber ihnen trotzdem den Freiraum 
lassen, sich auch ein Stück weit selber 
einzubringen und zu verwirklichen. Ich 
glaube, das gelingt uns manchmal 
besser, manchmal schon weniger gut. 
Wir beschäftigen uns auch jetzt erst seit 
drei Jahren intensiv damit, aber ich 
glaube, das sind so die drei 
Erfolgsfaktoren. Und ich glaube, wenn 
Du die Dinge kombiniert kriegst, dann 
hast Du auch nicht so das Problem, gute 
Leute zu kriegen und zu behalten. 


But you still have to allow for enough 
leeway so they can bring a piece of 
themselves to the mix and realize their 
full potential. I think we sometimes 
succeed rather well, at other times not so 
much. We have only been focusing on 
these points for the last three years, but I 
do think these are the three factors that 
lead to success. And I think if you are 
able to combine these things, then 
getting the right people, and also keeping 
them, is never really a problem. 


00:23:57 
(Dame aus 
dem 
Publikum) 
 
(Lady 
from the 
audience) 


Meine Frage geht in eine ähnliche 
Richtung. Wie macht Ihr das 
markentechnisch? Geht man heute 
auf Ströer.de sieht man natürlich 
autoform (?) Eure Heritage, von der 
Ihr kommt. Dann natürlich den 
Hinweis auf die Regionalwerbung, 
aber das findet ja digital unter 
Ströer.de nicht präsent statt. Das 
heißt – was ist da Eure Strategie, die 
ganzen Zukäufe tatsächlich – auch 
kulturell, aber eben auch 
markentechnisch – zu integrieren? 


My question goes in a similar 
direction. What is your attitude 
towards brand identity? If you go to 
Ströer.de, you'll of course find your 
heritage, your business background. 
Then you find the reference to the 
regional advertising, although that's 
not a part of the Ströer.de digital 
world. So my question is – what is 
your strategy? How are you planning 
to integrate all your new acquisitions – 
both culturally, but especially in 
regard to their brands? 


00:24:27 
C. Sch. 


Also, wenn ich einmal ganz ehrlich sein 
soll – da ist jetzt so eine offene Flanke 
[lacht]. Weil wir haben einfach so viele 
Dinge wo wir auch merken, das Thema 
Marketing – und wie viele Marken 
brauche ich/will ich – ist so eine Sache, 
mit der wir uns jetzt gerade 
ehrlicherweise auch erst auseinander 
setzen. Wo wir auch noch nicht die 
richtige Lösung gefunden haben. Ist es 
richtig, einfach den Leuten zu sagen: 
"Du, da steht Ströer drüber, alles andere 
ist unwichtig." Vielleicht ist das das 
richtige Modell, vielleicht ist es aber 


Well, to be completely honest – that's a 
bit of an open flank at the moment. 
[Laughs] Right now, there are so many 
things we are just now becoming aware 
of, especially in terms of marketing. 
How many brands do I want/need? – 
That is one of those issues, that in all 
honesty, we are just now starting to 
tackle. And we just haven't found the 
right solution yet. Is it right to just tell 
the people, "Look, there, right at the top 
you can see the name Ströer – everything 
else is unimportant." Maybe this is the 
right model; but maybe it's also 


Page 58 of 62
schon auch wichtig ein paar Sub-
Brands zu haben, oder es gar nicht so 
sehr zu differenzieren. 


important to have a few sub-brands; or 
maybe we shouldn't differentiate all that 
much. 


00:25:01 
C. Sch 


Momentan glaube ich auch dem Tempo 
geschuldet sind wir ein bisschen 
anarchisch unterwegs und müssen uns 
da sicherlich auch damit beschäftigen, 
wie Du Außenwirkung insgesamt – auf 
Kunden, unterschiedliche Stakeholder, 
Mitarbeiter – besser strukturierst. Aber 
es ist eben auch, fairerweise, ein 
Nebenaspekt von schnellem Wachstum, 
dass nicht alles perfekt ist. Ich glaube, 
das macht zum Beispiel auch den 
Charme hier von den Rockstars aus. 
Dass Du merkst, an vielen Stellen wird 
es immer professioneller und geiler, 
aber das fühlt sich eben auch alles noch 
so handgeklöppelt an. Und ich glaube, 
die Mischung ist es oft auch, die- 


At the moment I also think we're leaning 
a little towards anarchy because we have 
been moving along at such a fast pace. 
Of course we have to figure out a better 
structure for the image we present to the 
outside world – but also to our clients, 
various stakeholders and employees. But 
in all fairness I do want to point out that 
it is a side-effect of rapid growth that not 
everything is perfect. I think this also 
contributes to the charm of Rockstars 
here, for example. You can tell that in 
many places it's already pretty 
professional and awesome, but other 
areas still feel a little too DIY. And I 
think the combination is often what 
makes-

Was? Das gibt's doch nicht! Das 
muss ich mir meinen Dienst ja selber 
nachbehandeln (???) (Publikum 
lacht) 


What? I don't believe it! 
(???) (Audience laughs) 


00:25:43 
C. Sch. 


Also, die Bühne ist schon supergeil, 
aber... Ich meine... 


Well, the stage is really awesome, but... I 
mean... 


00:25:47 
P. W. M. 


Aber meine Stimme ist im Arsch, ja. 
(Publikum lacht) 


But my voice has gone to the dogs, yes. 
(Audience laughs) 


00:25:48 
C. Sch. 


Kann ich kurz erzählen... dass Du durch 
die Hintertür raus musstest? Also, das 
ganze Toilettenthema im Backstage-
Bereich, das hat der Philip noch nicht 
im Griff. Da musste einmal so ein 
LKW-Reifen herhalten... (Publikum 
lacht) 


Can I talk about how you... that you had 
to go out through the back door? All I 
can say is that Philip has to work a little 
harder to sort out the "toilet issue" in the 
backstage area. Because a truck tire was 
misused for a certain purpose... 
(Audience laughs) 


00:26:03 
(Herr 2

(Gent. 2

Christian, ich hätte noch eine Frage – 
bei der Vorstellung der 
Geschäftsbereiche gerade, auf der 
Folie habe ich aufmerksam gelesen, 
dass "Daten betrieben" – eigentlich 
fast in jedem dieser Bereiche stand. 
Wie denkt Ihr über die Nutzung von 
Daten nach? 


Christian, I have one more question – 
when you were talking about the 
strategic business fields I read the 
term "collect data" on one of your 
charts – and noticed it was actually 
also included in almost all of the other 
areas as well. What do you think 
about the use of data? 


00:26:22 
C. Sch. 


Ich glaube, das ist ein Thema, das wir 
so die letzten 12 Monate einfach 
gemerkt haben, dass in allen 


I think this is an issue we have become 
more aware of during the last 12 months, 
because it's an issue that is virulent in all 


Page 59 of 62
Geschäftsbereichen das Thema virulent 
ist, und wir haben halt gemerkt, dass es 
sehr häufig auch einen riesigen 
Unterschied ausmacht. Ja, wenn Du die 
Beacons in Außenwerbeträgern 
installierst, wirst Du plötzlich in 
Echtzeit über mobile SDKs-
Reichweiten verfügbar, und es gibt 
plötzlich einen ganz anderen Blick auf 
die Vermarktungsmöglichkeiten. Wenn 
Du im Publishing-Bereich aus der 
Vermarktung kommst, denkst Du sehr 
stark an Behavioral-Daten. 


areas of business, and we realized that it 
very often also makes a huge difference. 
If you install beacons in outdoor 
billboards, you are suddenly available 
via mobile SDKs coverage in real time, 
and you get a completely new 
perspective in regard to marketing 
possibilities. If you enter the publishing 
field with a background in marketing, 
you automatically think about behavioral 
data. 


00:26:54 
C. Sch. 


Wenn Du plötzlich mit Subscription-
Modellen arbeitest merkst Du, dass Du 
viel tiefergehende Daten hast. Von 
daher sind wir gerade auch dabei uns zu 
überlegen, wie kriege ich die einzelnen 
Themen da kombiniert und in Summe 
mehr Wert für die Firma geschaffen? 
Aber, dass Daten eine zentrale Rolle 
spielen – neben Inventar – davon sind 
wir absolut überzeugt. 


If you suddenly find yourself working 
with subscription models, you realize 
you have data that reaches much further 
down. So, right now we are in the 
process of finding a way of combining 
these individual issues, and thus create 
more total value for the company. But 
we are absolutely certain that data – as 
well as assets – plays a central role. 


00:27:15 
P. W. M. 


Naja, sehr, sehr gut. Ich kann nur 
sagen, also, ich bedanke mich bei Dir, 
dass Du hier bei uns auf der Bühne 
erstmal so super spannend erzählst. 
Ich glaube, es gibt nicht viele Chefs 
von börsennotierten Firmen, die sich 
hier so locker hinsetzen und das 
dermaßen glaubwürdig und 
sympathisch rüberbringen. Ich kann 
nur sagen – für uns, aus der 
Rockstars-Perspektive, ist natürlich 
genau das, was Ihr macht, ist halt 
Rockstars. Einfach sagen: "Okay, 
eine gewisse Anarchie muss sein, wir 
gehen da rein, wir glauben an das 
Thema, wir denken über die Dinge 
ganz anders, als die anderen im 
Markt." Insofern wünschen wir 
Euch natürlich massiv Glück dabei. 
Vielen Dank, dass Du da warst. Ich 
glaube, da kann man nur klatschen. 
[Applaus] 


Well, that all sounds really, really 
good. All I can say is thank you very 
much for joining us on the stage here, 
and telling us your exciting story. I 
don't think there are many COOs of 
publicly traded companies, who could 
just sit down here and tell things in 
such a believable and sympathetic 
fashion. I can only say – for us, from 
the Rockstars perspective, it is pretty 
clear that what you are doing is 
exactly that – being rock stars. You 
simply say, "Okay, a certain amount 
of anarchy is unavoidable. We'll go 
straight in. We believe in what we are 
doing. We have a completely different 
way of thinking as all the other 
players in the market." We of course 
wish you and your company all the 
best in your endeavor. Thank you so 
much for coming. I think all that's left 
to do here is give a big round of 
applause. [Applause]

Appendix 2 
Media Venture Investees Likely Advertising through Ströer 


 
• Hoccer – in early 2014, Media Ventures invested a headline number of €50 million in 


secure messaging company Hoccer.  A significant portion of the investment was for (or 
in) advertising on the Ströer network.  “’[Media Ventures] will be paying a portion of the 
50 million euros in Hoccer in cash, to promote the development of the technology’, states 
the article.  Most of the money will flow into an advertising campaign by Ströer, an Out-
of-Home media company, with the aim to present Hoccer as an alternative to WhatsApp 
through posters or big screens.”171,172 
 


• Spotted – in mid-2015, Media Ventures invested additional money in the startup dating 
app company.  “The dating startup further announced engaging in a long-term media 
partnership with the existing investor company Media Ventures, owned by poster 
entrepreneur Dirk Ströer.  Spotted refused to disclose the exact amount, only that it is not 
a media-for-equity deal.  ‘Due to achieved objectives, we received the media budget on 
top of the financing’ commented Spotted CEO Nik Myftari towards the Grundersszene.  
Overall, the sum of the deal is said to ENCOMPASS 14.5 million U.S. dollars.”173 


 
• EINFACHLOTTO.de – on 5 June 2014, the online company issued a press release titled 


“Launches Nationwide Billboard with Lothar Matthäus”.  (Matthäus is a famous German 
football player.)  The press release reads “One of [the company’s] shareholders, among 
others, is Media Ventures, the investment company of the Ströer Group, which holds 25.1 
percent.”  It also reads “Katja Semder, the marketing manager of [the parent company], 
says, ‘Our previous campaign has shown that we can increase our membership both 
quickly and efficiently just by using the classical channels.  That is why billboards and 
radio are the preferred types of media.’”174 


 
• Spontacts – In 2013, Media Ventures invested a seven-figure sum to support expanding 


the company’s media strategy, with CEO Dirk Stader highlighting the “strong integration 
of mobile and off-line [advertising]”175 The Spontact press release noted that “Media 
Venture’s extensive out-of-home advertising spaces – both billboards and digital domains 
– throughout Germany are being used to promote the leisure community Spontacts.”176 


 
• tape.tv – Media Ventures signed a three-year media deal in the “mid double-digit 


millions” with online music station tape.tv in 2013. An article announcing the deal notes 
that well-known media entrepreneur Dirk Ströer is the driving force at Media Ventures

and “operates a Germany-wide network of billboards on subways and bus stops under his 
family name. And exactly those are designed to help ‘plant the message in the minds of 
the people out there that you can watch music anywhere’”.177 The Media Ventures press 
release concurred: “[our] tens of thousands of billboards” remind people of that.178 


 
• Topdeals.de – in 2011 Dirk Ströer and Jens Kunath founded Topdeals.de, which is 


online coupon company (similar to Groupon).  “By December 2011, Ströer and Kunath 
want to win a million users for Topdeals.de.  To achieve this goal, a widespread 
campaign will start as early as the end of May.  For the airing of TV spots, online banners 
and billboards, a budget of EUR 7 million is available for the year 2011 alone.  In the 
following year, the advertising budget will increase to EUR 9 million; in 2013 to EUR 16 
million.  But whether Aha.de actually transfers this amount to the marketers is doubtful.  
The reason: As a major shareholder and associate of Ströer Out of Home Media, Dirk 
Ströer can obtain the outdoor advertising spaces at significantly lower rates.  As the focus 
of the campaign is on billboards – of the EUR 7 million, this year 4 million will be 
invested in out-of-home, 2.5 million in the web and only 500,000 in TV j- the actual net 
spending is likely to be significantly lower.  Ströer has already proven that the model can 
work: The dating portal Neu.de he founded in 1999 was initially also advertised on 
billboards – and established itself as one of the top players on the market.”179 


 
• Neu.de – in a 2013 interview, Dirk Stader, Media Ventures’s CEO stated “Well, the 


dating platform neu.de certainly makes for a great story.  I think we made dating more 
socially acceptable through the enormous advertising prints in our out-of-home billboard 
campaign.  Many still remember the Germany-wide billboard campaign that just 
consisted of the words neu.de written on the poster.  That awakened almost everybody’s 
curiosity, and people wanted to know the meaning behind it.  In addition, the exit was 
extremely lucrative, that much I can divulge here.”180 


 
• Weg.de – Media Ventures sold Comvel GmbH, the company that owns travel website 


weg.de.181 The portal grew rapidly and enjoys great name recognition, no doubt due to its 
extensive outdoor advertising campaigns. 


 
• Be Posh – an e-cigarette manufacturer with an anonymous investor from North Rhine-


Westphalia “with direct access to online and offline media” launched a multi-million euro 
advertising campaign in 2015.  Two items of note i) Cologne, where Ströer is based, is in 
North Rhine-Westphalia; ii) there is an implication that there will also be an online 
advertising campaign.182
