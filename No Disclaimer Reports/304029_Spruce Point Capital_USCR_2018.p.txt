Executive Summary

U.S. Concrete Has Striking Comparisons With Two 
of Spruce Point’s Most Successful Shorts Ever


China Integrated Energy
(Nasdaq: CBEH)


Caesarstone
(Nasdaq: CSTE)


Report Date 12/5/10 8/19/15 and  10/6/15


Market Value $320m $1,700m


Commodity 
Company 


Promotion


Leading non-state-owned integrated energy company in 
China engaged in three business segments: wholesale 
distribution of finished oil and heavy oil products, the 


production and sale of biodiesel and the operation 
of retail gas stations


Leading quartz countertop manufacturer capable of producing 
43% and 26% gross and EBITDA margins, while producing 


double digit growth in the fast growing US market. The 
Company claimed it needed to increase capex to construct a 
manufacturing facility in the US to accelerate its US footprint


Our Criticism Spruce Point’s research indicated that CBEH’s biodiesel 
business could not possibly produce the margins being 
represented, and that its capex and cash management 


policies raised serious concerns about 
the nature of its business


Our intense fundamental and forensic due diligence uncovered 
evidence of slowing US growth, margin pressure being covered-


up, and poor forecasting of capital expenditures which 
suggested over-capitalization of costs on the balance sheet


Successful Outcome


May 2011: Auditor KPMG resigned and noted concerns 
about management’s representations. CBEH shares were 
delisted and the SEC revoked its registration in Dec 2014


Two CEO/CEO’s and the CFO of Caesarstone have subsequently 
resigned. The Company has reported numerous manufacturing 


problems in both its new US production and Israeli facilities. 
Gross margins have contracted to 25%. The share price has 


fallen >70% from our initiation price

Spruce Point Believes U.S. Concrete (Nasdaq: USCR) Is 
A “Strong Sell” With 60% - 90% Downside Risk


A Poorly Constructed Commodity Roll-Up Strategy Showing Signs of Cracking:


Previous Failure: U.S. Concrete filed for bankruptcy after the financial crisis: The industry is difficult given the commodity nature of the 
products, intense competition, and need to be close to the customer because shipping costs are material  


Becoming More Dependent on Shady Acquisitions: USCR has acquired over 20 companies since 2012. It recently outbid industrial giant Vulcan 
Materials for Canadian small cap Polaris Materials and also purchased firms with alleged historical ties to organized crime


GAAP vs. Non-GAAP Strains: In 2017 there were a record number of adjustments to results, and yet Adjusted EPS grew by just 4%


Cash Flow Issues: Despite promoting sales and Adj. EBITDA growth of ~20% in the past three years, operating cash flow has been declining for 
more than 3 years in a row. Recent guidance of 60% cash flow conversion from Adj. EBITDA has been terribly missed


Stable Gross Margins In A Commodity Business: Despite cash flow issues, USCR has reported stable gross margins at 21% for three years, which 
is a remarkable feat given it operates in a commodity business, and we find peers reporting between 9% - 12% margins over the same period


Deja Vu Leverage Rising Again: USCR’s Net Debt / EBITDA was 3.5x prior to the crisis sending it to bankruptcy, and is now 3.8x as of 3/31/18. 
USCR’s current liquidity (cash and borrow capacity) as a percentage of LTM revenues stands at a multi-year low and worse than pre-crisis levels


Troublesome Management, Governance, and Auditor Red Flags: 


CEO Concerns and Rapid CFO Turnover: A routine background check of the CEO reveals an undisclosed DWI arrest for reckless driving, calling 
into question his judgement. USCR is on its fourth CFO since 2012. Recent CFO John Tusa, Jr. resigned after serving a little more than one year


Auditor Changes and No Independent Chief Accounting Officer: USCR is on its third auditor since 2012; Grant Thornton was recently dismissed 
in March 2017. USCR has historically kept the CFO in charge of the accounting function in favor of hiring a dedicated professional


Audit Fees Starting To Rise: Fees up 20% and 30% in 2015 and 2016, respectively. Lead engagement partner just had an Admin Consent Order


Material Weakness: Identified in 2016 related to internal controls and reporting of income taxes, which USCR claims to have rectified 


Who is on the Audit Committee: Only one rotation in the audit committee since embarking on its aggressive strategy in 2012. Spruce Point is 
concerned by the lack of accounting and financial knowledge of the committee members. Most are lawyers and strategists by background


Insider Ownership Declining: The CEO spends his time promoting USCR to retail investors on programs such as Cramer’s Mad Money. 
Meanwhile, in the past three years, the CEO’s ownership is down from 5.9% to 2.6% while all insiders are down from 10% to 5.3%. 


Evidence Suggesting an Undisclosed, On-Going SEC Investigation: Based on a recent FOIA request by Probes Reporter and our own FOIA
7


Spruce Point Believes U.S. Concrete (Nasdaq: USCR) Is 
A “Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons:


Digging Beneath The Surface We Find Evidence To Suggest Overstated Organic Growth:


USCR Claims Mid To High Single Digit Organic Growth: Evidence suggests organic growth is overstated, and mostly a function of pass through 
commodity price increases. We note realized prices by USCR hit a 5yr low in 2017, and have continued lower in Q1’18


USCR Makes Organic Growth Difficult To Calculate: USCR selectively discloses figures in periods when good, not bad. The Company has 
generally done a poor job of breaking out acquisition contributions in SEC filings


Spruce Point Uses Two Analyses To Estimate Underlying Organic Growth:


1. Piecing together selected USCR disclosures, we find average organic volume growth from 2015-2017 to be approximately zero


2. Using reported trucks and volume production, we estimate flat to modestly negative volume growth


Changes To Goodwill Impairment Testing Provide Another Clue: A few years ago USCR dropped revenue as a condition to its goodwill 
impairment measurement test from a weighted test of DCF, EBITDA, and revenue to just testing DCF and EBITDA


Aggressive Use of Capital Leases and Evidence To Suggest Overcapitalization of Expenses Inflating Adjusted EBITDA:


Operating vs. Capital Lease Choice Flatters EBITDA and Cash Flow: Operating leases reduce EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, while capital 
leases do not;  USCR runs capital lease repayments through the financing section of the cash flow statement


Capital Leases Usage Grows Every Year, Now Accounting For >50% of Total Capex Spending: USCR has aggressively increased capital lease 
usage, while it stopped disclosing leasing details in recent 10-K annual reports 


Adj EBITDA Is The Only Metric Management Is Compensated For Producing: The Board approves seemingly arbitrary EBITDA growth 
targets, and management generally hits them! Until recently, the committee didn’t adjust targets for acquisition contributions


Warning: Management’s History of Hitting Capex Targets Is Horrendous: USCR used to give sparse guidance of capex as a % of sales which 
it always missed. In 2017, when finally giving hard capex guidance (inclusive of capital leases), the company missed estimates by >40%


Vehicle and Truck Property Accounts Suggest Overcapitalization: Since 2012, USCR financials show ~500% growth in the vehicle property 
account, yet physical trucks are up only ~100%. USCR claims truck prices are stable, so overcapitalization of costs is a likely explanation


Numerous Examples of Accounting Problems Involving Trucks and Vehicles: Tied to misclassifying operating vs. capital leases (Celadon), 
capitalizing normal maintenance costs (Roadrunner Transportation), and inflation of vehicle values (Heartland Express)
8


Spruce Point Believes U.S. Concrete (Nasdaq: USCR) Is 
A “Strong Sell” For The Following Reasons:


Easy To Justify 60% – 90% Downside In USCR’s Share Price:


Analysts Are Naturally Bullish Despite USCR Not Offering Firm Sales or Earnings Guidance: USCR is covered by a roster of third tier brokers 
that offer an average price target of $86.30 per share, implying approximately 40% upside. Analysts are seemingly blind to USCR’s rapidly 
diminishing liquidity and recent poor performance, yet still assume 14% and 58% 2018E sales and EPS growth, respectively. Naturally, they 
expect great contributions from the Polaris acquisition, favoring an additional 100bps of EBITDA margin expansion. USCR does not offer 
firm revenue or earnings guidance, and analysts have done a poor job accurately forecasting results


USCR Trading Near All-Time Cyclical High Valuation: USCR is valued at approximately 1.2x, 8.0x, and 15x 2018E Sales, Adj EBITDA and Adj. 
EPS. On the surface, shares “appear” cheap, but analysts have been quietly and slowly cutting forward estimates, and we have little faith 
in management’s reporting given our documented concerns. Spruce Point also never recommends buying into a commodity company 
near the peak of a leverage cycle: this is a recipe for disaster! 


Only Indices Are Buying, No Real Fundamental Investors: We took a close look at USCR’s shareholder base a few years ago vs. today, and 
we find all of its fundamental owners are gone. What’s left is the who’s who of passive index chasers – not exactly a ringing endorsement 
to own USCR in our opinion 


Two Ways To Value USCR Point To 60% - 90% Downside Risk: Given our analysis that shows distortions in USCR’s Non-GAAP figures, we 
believe the best way to value the Company is on Free Cash Flow. We expect further deterioration which began three years ago, and apply 
a 20x – 25x multiple to reflect a discount to the peer average for its above average exposure to ready-mix, poor roll-up economics, and 
growing liquidity risk. Secondly, we adjust USCR’s book value for an estimated $60 - $85 million of overcapitalized costs to its vehicle 
property accounts and apply a 1.0x – 1.5x multiple range. These valuation perspectives indicate 60% to 90% downside or approximately 
$6.00 to $25.00 per share

USCR’s Capital Structure and Valuation


Source: Company filings and Wall St estimates


Note: Price / Adj Book Value adjusts for overcapitalization of vehicle assets


$ in millions, except per share figures


USCR is a commodity producer of ready-mix concrete with a junk credit of BB- / B1 Stable from S&P and Moodys. 


Its low valuation partially reflects this fact, but is based on management’s highly adjusted Non-GAAP figures. We 


do not believe investors and analysts are looking carefully at its aggressive use of capital leases which inflate 


EBITDA. Furthermore, analysts have aggressive forecasts for the business based on the belief that recent 


acquisitions will bear fruit and synergies, despite management giving little guidance.

Inability To Forecast


USCR’s former CFO outlined expectations for continued EBITDA to Free Cash Flow expectations of 60% in late 


Oct 2016. Ever since making that forecast, USCR has fallen increasingly short of target. Tusa’s resignation was 


announced just months later in March 2017


Jody Tusa (former CFO) Q3’16 Earnings Call: ”Yes, and Scott, so let’s go back 


to 2015, you saw that we had about a 60% conversion rate of EBITDA to free 


cash flow* and through what you have seen this year particularly for this quarter 


we are in line with that performance. So I will say the expectation moving 


forward around free cash flow generation to EBITDA will we continue to be 


at that 60% level, I think we will be close.”

USCR is showing signs of desperation in its acquisition strategy, over-paying for questionable acquisitions (notably Polaris 


Materials, a money-losing Canadian microcap), and buying businesses with alleged association to organized crime.

Questionable Organic Growth
17


Lack of Organic Volume Growth


USCR just started providing some data to allow for an analysis of its underlying organic growth rate. We find 


that underlying volume growth has essentially averaged zero, after adjusting for price increases, which are 


primarily a function of rising input costs

Organic Decline From Another Perspective


It is easy to see USCR’s organic struggles more carefully when dissecting both realized pricing and volume. Average 


ready-mixed concrete price increases peaked in 2015, and grew by just 2% in Q1’18 – a multi-year low. This suggests 


that supply is quickly catching up to demand. USCR also reports total ready mix volumes annually in its 10-K along with 


total trucks. By calculating average trucks during the year, we find that volumes per truck are also in modest decline. (1)

Note: Same chart on left, but based on just looking at total volume growth. We note

The Diminishing Importance of Revenue; 
Evidence USCR May Be Delaying Impairment


A few years ago USCR switched its goodwill impairment measurement test from a weighted test of DCF, EBITDA, and revenue 


to just testing DCF and EBITDA, not revenue. Revenue is the only metric difficult to manipulate, and would reflect USCR’s 


negative true organic volume growth rates. By excluding revenues as an impairment indicator, we believe that USCR is 


acknowledging that there is an organic growth problem with acquisitions, and is even possibly forestalling a goodwill 


impairment down the road. CECO Environmental, the last company Spruce Point identified that changed is goodwill impairment 


testing methodology, ultimately took a crippling impairment and cut its dividend (1)


Goodwill: We record as goodwill the amount by which the total purchase price we pay in our acquisition transactions exceeds our estimated fair value of 


the identifiable net assets we acquire. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may 


be impairment.  We generally test for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of each year, using a two-step process, which requires us to make certain 


judgments and assumptions in our calculations. The first step of the process involves estimating the fair value of our reporting units and comparing the 


result to the reporting unit's carrying value. We estimate fair value using an equally weighted combination of discounted cash flows and multiples 


of revenue and EBITDA.

No Volatility In Gross Margins For A 
Commodity Producer?


Many of USCR’s competitors have ready-mix amongst a larger portfolio of businesses, thus making precise 


comparisons difficult. However, Martin Marietta and Vulcan Materials, both larger and more vertically integrated 


operators, each report gross margins meaningfully lower than USCR’s consistent margins in the range of 21%. 


Also, the fact that USCR has virtually no volatility in annual gross margins as a commodity product producer should 


be viewed as a major red flag.


1)  Vulcan and USCR excludes depreciation, depletion and amortization expenses. We believe Martin Marietta excludes DD&A in 


its gross profit reporting as it does not discuss its impact on this metric

Questionable Margin Expansion


With no gross margin volatility, EBITDA margins consistently expand. USCR has offered an identical boilerplate 


explanation that it is related to volume, pricing, and efficiencies, up until recently. We will explore how aggressive use 


of capital leases likely explain some of the EBITDA margin expansion.

Capital vs. Operating Lease


Financial Statement Operating Lease Capital Lease


Income Statement
Reported as rent expense, a cash 


item that reduces 
EBIT, EBITDA, EPS


Lease payments bifurcated between
depreciation and interest expense, neither 


of which impact EBITDA. Reduces EPS


Cash Flow Statement
Reduces operating and 


free cash flow


Repayments flowing through financing 
section of the cash flow statement, which 
overstates operating and free cash flow


Balance Sheet No Impact
Assets increase through PP&E, liability 


increases through financial debt


Before we investigate USCR’s capital leasing use, we outline the effects of the choice on the key financial 


statements. Capital leases have the main effect of inflating EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, two key measures 


investors used to value USCR. More importantly, management’s bonus is tied heavily to EBITDA.
26


Warning: Increasing Dependence on Capital 
Lease Usage, And Terrible Capex Forecasting


Spruce Point believes that investors need to pay careful attention to USCR’s capital expenditure (capex) 


program. In 2017 for the first time, USCR gave hard capex guidance, which explicitly stated it included capital 


leases. USCR is becoming increasingly dependent on capital leases (>50% of total capex for the first time in 


2017) and has missed its capex forecast every single time.

Questionable Depreciation Assumptions


USCR appears to be using highly aggressive assumptions for the useful lives of its mixer and volumetric truck 


assets at 6 - 12 years (likely closer to the high end of the range based on other 10-K discussions). Based on 


comparative company disclosures, we believe the appropriate assumption is closer to 6 years. We estimate by 


depreciating trucks too slowly, USCR is understating depreciation by approximately $12.5 million, thereby 


benefiting EPS by $0.51 cents (1)

Asset Life Disclosure in the Operations Section of USCR’s Annual Report


1) In 2017, 25% of gross PP&E are vehicle assets. USCR reported $47.1m of depreciation and depletion expense. Therefore, we estimate $12.5m of depreciation expense associated 


with vehicles. A 50% reduction in estimated useful life would double depreciation expense. Assumes effective tax rate of 32% and 16.6m diluted shares outstanding. 


2) Uses CEMEX less aggressive old assumption

Signs To Suggest Overcapitalization 
of Vehicle Costs


USCR’s vehicle property account has increased at nearly 5x the rate of its underlying vehicle count. The delta cannot 


be explained by inflationary forces driving up the cost of mixer trucks. USCR has maintained throughout its annual 


reports a constant cost of truck prices in the range of $160 - $225k and $220 - $250k for new drum and volumetric 


mixers, though we believe many are acquired used. The mix of trucks to rolling stock has also held fairly constant

Blatant Signs of Overcapitalization 
of Vehicle Costs (cont’d)


There is additional evidence of extreme overcapitalization of costs. We analyze the annual capex reporting as a 


percent of its Gross P&E relative to a diversified set of aggregate and building material peers and find USCR to be a 


significant outlier when adjusted for capital leases. For the few peers that report vehicle PP&E and capital leases in 


PP&E, we also find USCR to be an outlier

Accounting Problems Not Uncommon With 
Fleet And Trucking Companies


Company (Ticker) Period Issue


Celadon Group (CGI) 2009 - 2011


• Errors in Lease Accounting: Determined that its previous method of accounting for certain 
equipment leases as operating leases was not in accordance with GAAP. The Company has 
restated most of its revenue equipment operating leases as capital leases based upon 
certain provisions included in the lease agreements. 


Road Runner 
Transportation


(RRTS)


Commence Nov 2016
Including restatement of 


2014 and 2015


• Material weaknesses identified “including the increased size and complexity arising from 
the acquisition of 25 non-public companies between February 2011 and September 2015”


• “The Company identified and corrected errors related to its accounting for the lease 
purchase guarantees it makes for its IC's that lease tractors from certain leasing 
companies.”


• “The Company identified and corrected errors related to its accounting for capitalized 
improvements. Specifically, the Company capitalized certain repair and maintenance 
expenses and other operating expenses that did not extend the useful life of the primary 
asset. This resulted in an understatement of operating expenses in the period which this 
occurred and an overstatement of depreciation expense in subsequent periods. Property 
and equipment and accumulated depreciation and related other operating expenses and 
depreciation expenses have been corrected in the restated consolidated financial 
statements.”


Heartland Express
(HTLD)


Through 2017


• Identified a material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting due to 
ineffective a) communication of objectives related to internal control, and b) development 
and documentation of internal controls impacting financial statement accounts and general 
controls over technology pertaining to user access and segregation of duties; and 
ineffective assessment of changes that impact internal control, which contributed to 
ineffective controls over the allocation of the purchase price for IDC to the assets acquired 
and liabilities assumed


• (July 2017) “Heartland’s purchase accounting remains ongoing and, depending on the 
planned schedule for refreshing IDC's fleet, the carrying values of the physical assets could 
be reduced versus the values previously recorded by IDC due to shorter useful lives”

SEC Investigation


According to reporting from Probes Reporter in Jan 2017, USCR is the confirmed subject of an undisclosed SEC 


investigation. We also probed for more information, and found there are 8 boxes of records. In our experience and 


opinion, that’s a tremendous amount of information being collected

Worked at Holcim (now LafargeHolcim) as VP of Business 
Development from 2003-07. In 2009, Holcim’s US

fined by the FBI for misappropriating its ready-mix 


concrete product, including for selling product older than 
90 minutes by diluting it with water, and for selling 


leftover concrete from previous customers. This fraud 
had allegedly occurred from 1996 through 2005, just two 


years before Sutherland left as a VP of Holcim US. 
Sutherland was not implicated.

Spruce Point is concerned that USCR’s audit committee lacks depth in the finance and accounting area. 


The audit committee has had only 1 rotation of a member (Rob Rayner/2016) since embarking on its ambitious 


acquisition strategy. The recent departure of Chairman Davis is a step in the right direction but leaves only two 


current members on the committee.

Insiders Motivated On Adjusted EBITDA


Our concerns about Adj. EBITDA quality are amplified by the fact that management is heavily compensated on hitting seemingly 


arbitrary and inflated Adj. EBITDA targets. The compensation committee may have finally caught on to USCR’s games, as 


evidenced by its recent decision to adjust EBITDA for acquisitions in 2016. As a result, management failed for the first time in


recent years to hit 100% of its targeted payout. Management compensation recently hit a high of 11.2% of GAAP EBIT, a figure 


on par with other poorly run companies Spruce Point has targeted in the past.

nonfinancial objective criteria. In 2016, the Compensation Committee again selected Total Adjusted EBITDA as the performance measure used for 


determining whether bonuses would be paid under the 2016 Plan. The Compensation Committee also reviewed the target level of Total Adjusted EBITDA 


under the 2016 Plan and adjusted it as appropriate to account for strategic acquisitions throughout 2016. Source: 2017 Proxy Statement

Audit Fees Rising In Advance 
of Recent Auditor Dismissal


USCR is on its third auditor in the past few years. We see that its audit fees have started to rise in advance of the recent dismissal 


of Grant Thornton. The Company’s most recent engagement partner is Brian Trimble according to the PCAOB, a Grant Thornton  


audit partner based in Tulsa, Oklahoma despite the fact that U.S. Concrete is based right outside of Dallas, TX. (1) According to 


public records, Mr Trimble started his career at the defunct auditor Arthur Andersen (which collapsed from the Enron scandal) and 


later worked at Samson Resources Corp, which filed for bankruptcy (2)

Irrational Valuation Expansion


Source:  USCR Financial Statements


Enterprise Value / Revenues Enterprise Value / Adj EBITDA Price / Adj EPS


Current investors are paying a significant premium to the Company’s historical valuation – and that is on the 


Company’s suspect adjusted metrics taking them at face value.


Spruce Point finds it difficult to justify USCR’s valuation in light of its suspect financial practices, low/no 


organic growth, and struggling roll-up.

Analysts have poorly forecasted USCR’s financial results, which we believe lowers their credibility in 


valuing the Company. Estimates continue to contract.

USCR’s free cash flow has been contracting for 
three years straight and now stands at $50.8m 


in the LTM 3/31 period. We expect this trend to 
continue as it is weighed down by dozens of 


poorly integrated acquisitions and the burden 
of $43m in annual interest expense. Analysts 


forecast $84m of free cash flow in 2018 which 
we believe will sorely disappoint

USCR trades at an inflated 3.5x price to book 
value for a collection of underperforming assets 


that we estimate generate little to no organic 
growth. We also believe the evidence suggests 


USCR overcapitalizes its vehicle asset by 
approximately $60 to $85m. (3) Global peers 


with higher quality assets and more 
diversification trade at an average of 2x book 


value, but USCR should trade at a discount


$ in millions, except per share amounts


Given the evidence we’ve presented that USCR’s GAAP financials cannot be taken at face value, we believe the best 


way to value the Company is on Free Cash Flow. We also attempt to adjust USCR’s book value for an estimated 


$60 to $85m of overcapitalization in vehicle costs implied from our detailed peer review. 


(1) Downside based on $61.20/sh


(2) USCR’s normalized effective tax rate per the company is 26%


(3) We use two different peer analysis:


a) We use Summit Materials gross vehicle PP&E of $47k multiplied by USCR’s 2,770  vehicles= $131m estimated vehicle PP&E. Compare with current vehicle PP&E of 


$216m implies ~$85m of overcapitalization  


b) Peers use an average of 2% of gross PP&E for capitalized leases which implies $17m of normalized leases for USCR. Compare with USCR’s gross capital leases of $77m 


as of 12/31/17 which suggests approximately $60m of overcapitalization
