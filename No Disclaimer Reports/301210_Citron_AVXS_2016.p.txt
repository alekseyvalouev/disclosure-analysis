AveXis: The Next Biotech Blowup 
12-Month Target: $9.00 
24-month target $5.00 


 
Rarely in biotech do we see a situation where an investor can simply perform their own due 
diligence and be on the right side of the trade without needing to be a scientist. In the case of 
AveXis (NASDAQ:AVXS), all you need is a healthy dose of skepticism, willingness to do the 
research, and a bit of empathy to reveal that there's nothing here beyond a glorified stock 
promotion. It will soon trade in the single digits.  
 


The hopeful story of a cure for terminally ill babies is powerful enough to bring forth the worst 
of Wall Street's greed, which has the power to sell this story to investors despite the absence of 
real clinical data. If it wasn't for the horrendously warped way the US pharma market prices its 
drugs, AveXis could not even have completed its IPO. 
 


The background of this story is exposed in an excellent piece published a month ago. Citron 
unhesitatingly recognizes good quality research and therefore credits Mako Research with a 
carefully done profile on why AveXis is nothing more but a stock promotion being orchestrated 
by highly questionable management. 
 


We won't bother repeating all of their points, but for the foundation of the story we suggest 
readers start here:

Citron presents the bullet point summary of the Mako Story: 
 CEO and company founder both have deeply troubling backgrounds reflecting corporate 


misdeeds, DOJ indictments, fraud suits, bankruptcy and kickbacks 
 Drug's principal investigator's prior company imploded under fraud investigations and 


SEC-revoked registration, and forced by SEC to retract a recent study for another 
company, all omitted from his current bio 


 Ownership of IP rights to current drug is subject of a lawsuit, with potentially 
devastating consequences for AveXis; yet, undisclosed in IPO registration docs 


 Only efficacy data for its only drug is a highly flawed, non-blinded, subjectively-scored 
study -- not executed to any reasonable scientific standard of proof  


 The single medical institution performing the study has a vested interest in AVXS stock 
 AveXis has no other drugs or gene-therapies in pipeline -- if they acquire something else 


in the marketplace, they have to bid against everyone else 
 Tiny addressable market (estimated < 240 births per year) for SMA Type 1 babies

 Superior drug from blue-chip-credentialed competitor is on track for imminent FDA 
approval and establishing EAP for eligible patients 


 Soon-to-be-approved competitor's drug plus existing lawsuit over IP ownership with 
self-help group insures tremendously narrowed window of opportunity for future trials 
and ultimately obstructed market penetration for AveXis. 





Citron will now add to that story by explaining how this stock will end. Investors won't have 
long to wait either ... the end will come sooner than later. 
 


AveXis went public in February 2016 at $20. It immediately broke syndicate price as investors 
reflected obvious concerns about competition in the marketplace for drugs treating Spinal 
Muscular Atrophy (SMA) and the questionable practices of their study.  


https://www.briefing.com/investor/analysis/story-stocks/AveXis-(avxs)--ipo-prices-well-only-to-get-slammed-in-open-market.htm 
 


Yet the stock ran to $36 in May, a price point at which the company was thrilled to execute a fat 
follow-on offering.  
 


The price run was fueled when AVXS was granted the FDA drug designation of "Breakthrough 
Therapy", because SMA Type 1 is truly a life-and-death condition. However, this designation 
does not grant automatic validation of a drug candidate (see below). Then, with the market in 
a frenzy to find Sarepta "me-too" stories, the stock ran over $65, and now hovers around $50. 
 


"How?", you ask? Simple! The market went nuts on the run-up of false-comp Sarepta (SRPT), 
which is up 500% since January on a surprise, controversial and emotionally-driven FDA 
approval for a similarly rare indication (Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy), despite questionable 
efficacy data for Sarepta's drug. Then the market went looking for "me-too" phenomena stocks, 
and found this one.  
 


Dare we Apply some Logic in an Illogical World? 
 


Since the date of AveXis's IPO at $20 a share in February 2016, they have not enrolled any new 
patients and have not delivered any clinical data that would compel the FDA to approve this 
experimental therapy. They continue to analyze data from the same subset of patients. This 
might be a different landscape if there were no alternative treatments available, but in the 
intervening months: 
 


Their main competitor (Nusinersen from Biogen and Ionis) is dominating the 
science behind a real treatment of treating Spinal Muscular Atrophy. 
  


 In April, Ionis and Biogen's Nusinersen met all primary endpoints in a Phase 
2 study, with no safety or tolerability concerns identified. 
http://ir.ionispharma.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=222170&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2158750 





 Then just months later, in August, Ionis and Biogen's study met its primary 
endpoint in an interim analysis of its Phase 3 trial for both survival and 
motor milestone responses:

Ionis and Biogen have plans to obtain FDA approval for Nusinersen in Q1 2017. 
 


 
http://www.smatrust.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/EU-Community-Statement_FINALVCB.pdf 





Meanwhile, AveXis stock is over twice the price of its initial offering despite shareholders 
biggest risk having become a reality: Nusinersen works, safely and effectively. It will most likely 
earn FDA and European approval. 
 


This is the worst possible news for AveXis shareholders and was even called out as a risk factor 
in AveXis’s corporate filings: 
 


From the AveXis IPO: 
 





https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652923/000104746916010121/a2227319z424b4.htm 
 


In fact, AveXis changed this language in their follow-on offering, to address explicitly the 
looming risk of a Nusinersen approval: 
 





https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1652923/000104746916015407/a2229653z424b4.htm 
 


With the news since IPO, it's unimaginable that this stock has run 
higher than its IPO price. How can it be trading at levels 50% higher 
than its secondary price of $34? 
 


The writer of this article is a parent.  I am sure many of the readers are as well. If you happen to 
bear the misfortune of a baby born with Type 1 SMA, are you going to treat your child with a 
drug with FDA approval based on robust multi-site clinical data, or are your going to enroll your 
child into an experimental gene therapy trial executed at just one clinic? It would be 
irresponsible, unethical, and should be illegal for anyone to put his or her baby on any 
alternative treatment. This condition requires early treatment, with good clinical outcomes 
reflective of early treatment.  
 


In a post-Nusinersen approval world, AveXis faces severe risks of NEVER being able to complete 
full clinical studies.  (NOTE: In order to test the efficacy of AVXS-101, babies treated with 
Nusinersen would obviously never be candidates for enrollment.)  
  


"* availability of competing therapies and clinical trials, including Ionis 
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Biogen's proposed global expanded access program for 


Nusinersen for eligible patients with SMA Type 1" 


 "We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change and the 
possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop 
therapies that are more advanced or effective than ours, which may adversely affect our 


financial condition and our ability to successfully market or commercialize AVXS-101." 


"The companies now plan to file for marketing approval with regulatory authorities in the 
next few months and are working to open an expanded access program (EAP) this Autumn, 
to patients with infantile onset SMA (consistent with Type 1) prior to potential regulatory 
approval. "

C'mon Citron! AveXis's drug is designated a “Breakthrough”! 
 


Despite the lack of clinical data, part of the enthusiasm for AveXis stock was that it was granted 
"Breakthrough Therapy Designation" by the FDA in July:  


http://investors.AveXis.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254285&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=2186665 
 


While the word “breakthrough” might seem like the FDA has committed to a fast-track to 
approval – this is simply not the case. If a drug fits the need of a serious or life threatening 
disease with the potential of substantial treatment advantages over existing treatments, it can 
receive “Breakthrough Therapy” status in order to streamline its approval path. Maybe the FDA 
should rethink that word, as investors are easy confuse its true meaning.  
 


A Bloomberg story that best explains the "Breakthrough Therapy" designation: 
 


"Breakthrough Drugs Don't Always Break Through" 
https://www.bloomberg.com/gadfly/articles/2016-08-01/seres-therapeutics-btd-failure-fallout 





Even the AMA agrees, deeming the term "aspirational". 
 


http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2442501 
 





What about the FDA Approving a 20 Patient Phase I Study – 
Isn’t this a Bullish Sign for Early Approval? 
 


Investors cheered this news, but is it really so bullish? Investors need to take note that the 
company published only excerpted segments of the meeting minutes.  
 


It is Citron's experience that when a company practices selective disclosure, it is to avoid 
disclosing what management does not want the investing public to know.  
 


 
https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/11/01/885355/0/en/AveXis-Announces-Single-Arm-Design-for-U-S-Pivotal-


Study-of-AVXS-101-in-SMA-Type-1-Patients.html 
 


The FDA can expedite reviews for drugs when there is no alternative for patients with serious 
and/or life-threatening conditions. Without head-to-head testing against Nusinersen, and its 
overwhelming approval looming, considering AveXis's clinical trial evidence is so thin, the 
motivation to expedite AVXS-101's path to approval simply evaporates.  
 


Can't AveXis become the next Sarepta? 
 


Another contributing factor for AveXis to be trading higher than its original IPO price was the 
FDA approval of Sarepta's treatment for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy(DMD). The quality of 


"... with FDA offering a number of constructive suggestions which we believe will 
better enable implementation of a pivotal study design that is most appropriate for the 
patients suffering from this devastating disease... "

the clinical data for that drug has long been under scrutiny, and its approval was controversial. 
FDA approval of Sarepta's eteplirsen left investors in a frenzy chasing “me-too” stories, and 
AveXis became a beneficiary. 
 


Despite Sarepta's stock price being cut in half from its post-approval highs, Citron notes the 
key differences between the two companies: 
 


 There was no alternative therapy even suggested for treating DMD. For 
SMA, Nusinersen has already filed for multiple approval indications. 


 Sarepta actually monitors Dystrophin as a biomarker to directly measure 
efficacy. AveXis has shown no chemical marker of its treatment's method 
of action, relying only upon a clinician's subjective observations of 
patients at a single center. 


 Sarepta had very clear inclusion/exclusion criteria to insure a 
homogenous patient group. AveXis's study has serious disclosure 
deficiencies in its tiny patient cohort that could be skewing its results.  





Lastly and most important, the patient advocacy groups for SMA babies are actively trying to 
advocate for fast approval of Nusinersen, but NOT AveXis-101.

Putting the Brakes on the “Citron Bias” 
 


Shareholders of AveXis might be thinking, "of course Citron is going to present a biased 
presentation!"  To that criticism we refer to the informational source to the world – Google. 


 
What looks like Clinical Medicine and what looks like a Stock Promotion: 
 


To illustrate how one-sided this argument really is just go to Google News and search the word 
“Nusinersen”. The following 4 articles are from the past week alone on Nusinersen:

The science behind AveXis's stock has captured the hope of only the 
investment bankers ... and the hospital who has a vested interest in 
AveXis's share price... 
 


 Conclusion 
 
Given the extremely shady backgrounds of AveXis management and the dubious track records 
of the lead investigators at the single clinical site at which its drug is trialed, investors need to 
apply professional skepticism to the much-touted "two babies sitting up" claim in AveXis's trial 
findings, absent any proof that these babies in fact were symptomatic for SMA Type 1 disease. 
Bear in mind that this finding is dependent upon only subjective CHOP-INTEND behavioral 
scoring. There is no biochemical analysis of the subjects' condition in this clinical evaluation. 
Meanwhile, the anticipated Spring 2017 approval of Biogen/Ionis's competitor drug with 
overwhelming safety and efficacy data looms over this company.  
 


With only 240 cases of SMA Type 1 in the USA per year, there is not room for another 
competing drug that does not show SUPERIORTITY over Nusinersen. Synergy is not sufficient, 
because there is no ethical rationale for a blinded study.  
 
The open label biased testing of AveXis will soon be exposed to the stock market as obviously as 
it has already been exposed to the scientific community.

Appendix: AVXS-101 
 
For the science types who want to forego logic, and still want to the believe AveXis investment 
thesis, it is time to demand the company reveals some real science and not just observational 
CHOP-INTEND scores.  
 
Here is a good start -- and Yes, Citron assembled this with a team of science consultants: 
 


Specific genotypes (genetic testing results) for each child. This should include 
information about so called ‘helper genes’ which the literature has 
suggested result in milder cases. (more detail can be found in the 
Mako report). Their protocol speaks to a very specific genotype (one of 
many genotypes that are all considered SMA) that became an 
exclusion criteria once they had treated 10 kids due to the ‘predicted 
mild phenotype’ (aka severity) associated with that genotype. So the 
company can’t claim it doesn’t have all this information. Nor can it 
claim that it isn’t aware that specific genotypes matter as far as disease 
severity. Nor can they claim HIPAA since they put the pictures of the 
kids in every presentation they can.  


 
Biological proof that the drug is doing what is claimed. Nusinersen shows that 


treated kids have 2x to 5X increase in mRNA (mRNA leads to protein 
synthesis) compared with kids that don’t. Not only does AVXS not have 
any of this data, they have no means of collecting it. That would 
require them to get CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) obtained by a lumbar 
puncture which their protocol makes no mention of. So they aren’t 
even checking to see if the drug got to its intended target location or if 
it worked. They just want us to rely on the CHIP-INTEND scores and 
developmental observations. As Citron mentioned previously, even 
SRPT had a whiff of dystrophin when they biopsied the muscles. Doing 
a protocol revision to get some CSF would not be a big deal at all. 


 
The actual complete FDA minutes from their recent meeting.  Again, since 


they are expecting us to believe that they can get approved on a 15 
patient study, every tiny bit of data matters. Let us judge for ourselves 
what the FDA thinks about their trial design. Letting a company move
Citron Dissects AveXis December 14, 2016 Page 8 of 8 
  


forward on a trial design does not mean the FDA agrees with it and 
there might be some telling language in there. But they won’t let the 
public see it, so who knows!?!? 


 
The physician’s clinical report for the two walkers at baseline. The protocol 


requires the kids to have copies of SMN2 and show clinical signs of the 
disease. The issue with this is that babies known to have two copies of 
the gene are naturally going to be scrutinized with expectation of 
seeing any sign of disease whether it exists or not. What appears to be 
the case is that the two walkers were not showing ANY real signs of the 
disease (their CHOP-INTEND scores were well in the normal range for 
children their age — again, the Mako report has the details).  
 
The net result of this is the looming risk of study bias by cherry-picked 
patients. It is quite clear in the literature that not all kids with two 
copies develop the severe form of SMA. It’s only without the benefit of 
hindsight, and without the support of approved high-efficacy drugs, 
that anyone can get away with assuming that two-copies patients will 
always progress to severe disease. So if they want us to believe these 
two kids were unalterably headed toward a bad prognosis, they 
certainly haven’t done a good job of documenting it.
