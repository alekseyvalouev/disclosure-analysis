Soros	Stake	Silliness:	Arch	Coal	And	Peabody	Energy	Likely	To	Go
Bankrupt

by:	Studioso	Research


Summary


Shares	of	Arch	Coal	and	Peabody	Energy	gained	significantly	in	the	last	three
trading	sessions.


This	was	largely	a	result	of	a	delayed	reaction	to	the	non-news	of	George	Soros
buying	small	stakes	in	the	two	companies.


Both	companies’	bonds	suggest	a	significant	risk	of	bankruptcy	for	both	companies
in	the	next	year	or	two,	in	which	case	the	shares	would	fall	to	zero.


Even	if	bankruptcy	is	avoided,	the	companies’	bonds	suggest	that	the	shares	are
wildly	overvalued	and	should	decline	to	levels	below	Tuesday’s	close,	before	the
Soros	stake	silliness	started.


On	Friday,	August	14	at	4.03	pm,	Soros	Fund	Management	(SFM)	filed	its	13F	for	the
quarter	ended	June	30,	2015.


The	13F	revealed	that	SFM	held	stakes	in	Arch	Coal	(NYSE:ACI)	and	Peabody	Energy
(NYSE:BTU)	as	at	June	30.


Specifically,	it	held	553,200	shares	in	ACI	(value	in	13F	listed	as	$188,000)	and	1,029,400
shares	in	BTU	(value	in	13F	listed	as	$2,254,000).


For	the	sake	of	clarity,	given	that	ACI	completed	a	1	for	10	split	on	August	3,	the	stake	in
ACI	(if	still	held)	is	now	55,320	shares.


On	Monday,	August	17	and	Tuesday,	August	18,	trading	in	ACI	and	BTU	was	largely
uneventful.	BTU	traded	on	low	volume	on	both	days	and	closed	at	$1.12	on	August	18
compared	to	the	Friday,	August	14	close	of	$1.13.	ACI	closed	at	$1.47	on	August	18
compared	to	the	Friday,	August	14	close	of	$1.26,	however	with	the	company	having	only
21.3	million	shares	outstanding,	a	17%	move	for	a	stock	with	a	market	capitalisation	(at
the	time)	of	under	$32	million	is	unremarkable.


Media	hype	and	the	Soros	silliness	starts

On	Wednesday,	August	19,	Fox	News	picked	up	the	"news",	and	published	an	article
about	SFM	taking	a	stake	in	the	two	companies.


This	led	to	gains	in	shares	of	ACI	and	BTU,	which	resulted	in	additional	media	outlets
picking	up	the	story	later	on	Wednesday.	24/7	Wall	Street	published	this	article	and	The
Guardian	published	an	article,	too.


This	saw	a	positive	feedback	loop	of	further	share	price	appreciation	and	further	media
coverage	of	the	Soros	story	on	Thursday,	such	as	that	in	Barrons	and	Marketwatch.


On	Friday	21	August,	ACI	closed	at	$3.85	compared	to	its	Tuesday,	August	18	close	of
$1.47,	a	gain	of	161%	in	three	trading	sessions.	BTU	closed	at	$1.78	compared	to	its
Tuesday,	August	18	close	of	$1.12,	a	lower	(but	still	ridiculous)	gain	of	58%	in	three
trading	sessions.


Soros	silliness	analysis


There	are	several	important	points	to	note	about	the	trading	action	in	the	two	companies
since	Tuesday's	close.


First,	the	gains	in	ACI	and	BTU	are	more	about	media-generated	momentum	(initiated	by
the	Fox	News	article)	rather	than	the	non-news	of	SFM	taking	a	stake	in	the	two
companies.	This	should	be	obvious	for	two	reasons:


·	The	13F	was	filed	on	the	afternoon	of	Friday,	August	14,	and	the	manic	trading	only
began	on	Wednesday	19th	after	the	Fox	News	article	was	published.


·	Another	"Soros	stock"	was	Ohr	Pharmaceutical	(OHRP),	with	SFM	disclosing	a	12,100
share	stake	in	the	same	13F	filing.	On	Friday,	August	14,	OHRP	closed	at	$2.41,	and	on
Monday,	August	17,	the	Soros	effect	was	immediate,	and	took	the	stock	as	high	as	$3.15
on	heavy	volume.	The	manic	trading	dissipated	quickly,	and	on	Friday,	August	21,	OHRP
had	settled	back	to	$2.58.


Second,	given	Soros'	wealth	(reported	at	more	than	$24	billion)	it	is	reasonable	to	assume
that	Soros	himself	does	not	"pick"	every	stock	in	SFM's	portfolio.	As	noted	by	BuyersStrike
on	Twitter	early	last	week:	"sorry	retail,	George	doesn't	do	all	his	own	stock	picking".


This	is	particularly	true	given	the	small	(for	Soros)	stakes	in	ACI	and	BTU.	As	at	the	June
30,	2015	reporting	date,	the	55,320	share	stake	in	ACI	was	worth	$188,088	and	the
1,029,400	share	stake	in	BTU	was	worth	$2,254,386.	Compared	to	his	net	worth	of	over

$24	billion,	a	$2.25	million	stake	in	BTU	is	a	tiny	position,	and	$188,088	(the	value	of	the
ACI	position)	is	equivalent	to	the	loose	change	Soros	might	find	if	he	lifted	up	the	cushions
in	his	furniture.


Third,	although	one	cannot	deny	that	Soros	has	been	a	successful	investor	for	many
years,	his	purchase	of	ACI	and	BTU	is	no	guarantee	of	long-term	investment	success.	In
the	case	of	OHRP,	which	experienced	some	Soros	silliness	on	Monday	17th,	the	company
has	a	dubious	history	as	outlined	in	a	previous	Seeking	Alpha	article,	including	a	paid
promotional	research	report	and	reverse-merger	background.	Also	as	noted	above,	OHRP
shares	closed	on	August	21	at	a	level	less	than	10%	above	where	they	closed	on	August
14	before	the	Soros	silliness	started.


Abeona	Therapeutics	(NASDAQ:ABEO)	saw	some	Soros	silliness	in	early	May,	following
the	announcement	of	SFM	taking	a	stake	in	the	company.	Like	OHRP,	the	company	has	a
dubious	background,	as	outlined	in	another	Seeking	Alpha	article.	ABEO	has	not	yet
responded	to	the	detailed	allegations	in	that	report,	and	has	since	completed	a	secondary
share	sale	at	$5.50,	a	price	more	than	50%	below	the	peak	of	the	Soros	silliness	in	early
May.


Fourth,	the	13F	filing	refers	to	positions	held	by	SFM	as	at	June	30,	2015.	There	are	no
guarantees	that	SFM	still	holds	shares	of	ACI	and	BTU,	particularly	given	the	massive
gains	in	the	two	companies'	share	prices	last	week.


Financial	analysis


Ignoring	the	above	discussion	about	the	non-news	of	the	SFM	stakes	in	the	two
companies,	it's	worthwhile	to	look	at	the	precarious	position	of	the	two	companies.

With	five	bond	issues	trading	below	16,	and	four	of	those	below	11,	the	market	believes
that	ACI	is	an	extremely	poor	financial	shape	and	is	highly	likely	to	go	bankrupt.	Indeed,
the	company	is	trying	to	complete	a	debt	exchange	offering,	and	on	August	17	extended
the	offer	deadline	to	August	28	presumably	due	to	lack	of	interest	from	bondholders.


The	three	ACI	bond	issues	with	coupons	of	7.00%	or	7.25%	(maturing	June	2019,	June
2021	and	October	2020)	are	trading	below	11,	suggesting	that	the	market	believes	there
are	less	than	2	years	of	coupon	payments	remaining	before	the	company	goes	bankrupt.
More	likely,	the	price	of	11	represents	investors'	opinion	that	it's	unlikely	the	next	coupon
payments	will	be	made,	and	11	cents	in	the	dollar	represents	what	investors	believe	they
can	recover	in	bankruptcy	reorganization.

We	concede	that	the	above	table	indicates	that	BTU	is	in	a	stronger	financial	position	than
ACI.	However	to	use	a	financial	markets	cliché,	it's	the	least	dirty	shirt	of	the	two.


As	we	noted	on	Twitter	on	August	21,	the	December	2066	bond	(CUSIP	704549AG9,	last
bond	in	the	above	table)	is	trading	below	15.	With	a	coupon	of	4.75%,	this	represents
approximately	four	years	of	coupon	payments.	Similarly	to	the	low-priced	ACI	bonds,	the
price	of	15	for	the	BTU	bond	more	likely	represents	the	perceived	value	of	the	bond	in
bankruptcy	organization.


Furthermore,	the	November	2021,	November	2026	and	September	2020	bonds	trade
below	26,	also	indicating	deep	distress.


On	August	20,	DonutShorts	observed	that	the	March	2022	bond	made	a	new	low,	despite
the	manic	gains	in	BTU	stock.


Conclusion


The	bonds	of	ACI	and	BTU	both	suggest	an	extremely	high	chance	of	bankruptcy,	with
ACI	likely	to	file	for	bankruptcy	protection	in	the	next	12	months,	and	BTU	likely	to	file
within	the	next	two	years.	In	such	a	scenario,	the	companies'	shares	would	almost
certainly	be	worthless.


In	the	unlikely	event	that	ACI	and	BTU	somehow	manage	to	avoid	bankruptcy,	the
companies'	bonds	provide	a	better	risk/reward	profile,	being	senior	in	the	capital	structure
to	the	common	shares.	They	would	also	continue	to	provide	investors	with	coupon

payments:	several	ACI	bond	issues	give	current	yields	of	over	50%	(!)	and	several	BTU
