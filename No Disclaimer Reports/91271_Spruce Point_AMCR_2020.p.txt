Spruce Point’s Activist Success Exposing Poorly 
Executed Packaging And Industrial Roll-Ups


Spruce Point has a strong track record of exposing highly promoted industrial roll-ups and packaging companies before investors 
figure out that the businesses had inflected negatively. 


Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Short-selling involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of infinite loss potential. Please see Full Legal Disclaimer at the front of the presentation.

Report 2/10/15 2/13/17 1/15/14 (Prescience Point)* 12/13/18


Market Cap $3.2 billion $430 million $10.1 billion $15.1 billion


Company 
Promotion


Leader in the rigid and flexible packing 
industry. Successful ability to acquire and 


integrate numerous acquisitions to extract 
synergies, increase earnings and cash flow. 


Ability to effect a turnaround despite 
challenging end markets


Effective roll-up acquirer serving the 
environmental, energy, fluid handling and 


filtration industrial segments. Its largest 
PMFG acquisition would be a success and 


allow for rapid delivering of its balance 
sheet, and renewed growth


Best of breed recycled auto part

Leading logistics and transportation 
company that operates as a highly 


integrated network of people, technology

$8bn for a mega-deal to propel its share 


price to $145


Our 
Criticism


Poorly executed roll-up with limited 
disclosures about acquisition costs, and 


deal performance post-closing. Investors 
are overlooking Greif’s material weakness, 


and still buying into management’s 
aggressive Free Cash Flow definition, and 
excessive add-back adjustments to EPS. 
Dual class share structure presents poor 
governance and insiders focused on pay 


vs. performance


A poorly constructed roll-up, we argued 
CECO was forestalling a goodwill 


impairment, its cash flow would fall
significantly in 2017, and it could come 


under covenant pressure. CECO was 
misportraying its true leverage, while its 


end markets were contracting. 
We estimated downside risk of 30%-60%


An ineffective roll-up by a management 
team with a history of financial failure 


(Waste Management / Discovery Zone). 
LKQ is caught in a gross margin squeeze 
being masked by relentless acquisitions, 


and aggressive inventory accounting open 
to significant mgmt judgement. Its move to 
Europe is an implicit acknowledgement of 


waning domestic growth


XPO’s financials should be viewed 
cautiously as a result of aggressive 


accounting assumptions, from a CEO 
known for aggressive roll-up strategies. 


The Board is not best suited to oversee the 
strategy, and the stock is a Wall St. darling 
poised to disappoint as its fragile financial 


condition becomes evident


Successful 
Outcome


The CEO was ousted shortly after our 
report. Greif continued to miss Wall Street 
sales and earnings estimates, and failed to 


turnaround its business as promised. 
Further, Greif  curtailed additional M&A 


for four years post our report 


CECO took a goodwill charge in Q4’16 as 
predicted, and changed its presentation of 


its financial leverage in its investors 
presentation - implicitly acknowledging 


our criticism. Q2’17 results were 
significantly below expectations, it 


admitted continuing challenges in its end 
markets, and its YTD operating cash flow 


has evaporated. CECO’s shares were 
downgraded, and shares fell >40%  


Gross margins have declined from over 
47% to 39%. The Company’s successive 
acquisition in Europe and domestically 


have failed to boost its share price. LKQ’s 
multiples have contracted significantly. Its 
CFO was replaced (Feb 2015) and its CEO 


recently stepped down (March 2017)


XPO cut its guidance and missed financial 
targets. Its COO was terminated after XPO 
lost a substantial customer, believed to be 


Amazon. XPO’s mega-deal never 
happened, and instead it tempered its 
growth strategy by turning to levered 
share repurchases. XPO talked about 
restarting acquisitions, but instead is 


saying it could dismantle the company

Our Criticism New management is more aggressive, using 
financial and accounting tactics to inflate the 


share price. The recent acquisition of 
FLAWLESS hair care was expensive and will 


disappoint investors. Governance lapses 
have allowed management to reap unjust 


bonuses based on non-cash gains. Shares at 
$80 trade 8% above analyst targets


AMETEK isn’t creating any value by 
delivering zero organic growth and 


that its financial statements showed 
signs of strain with aggressive 
accounting. We believed its 


premium valuation multiple could 
not be sustained as the quality of its 


acquisitions deteriorated


Excessive cost capitalization from a 
12 year “Blue Ocean” ERP 


implementation. Unusual corporate 
structure that omits product level 


margin discussion. Closeness of mgmt 
with PwC its auditor. Financial strains 


being signaled and anomalies in 
China. Extreme valuation with price 


14% over avg analyst price target


China capital expenditure 
anomalies, notably consistent mis-


forecasting. Capex issues often 
linked to gross margin inflation. 


Excessive spending on a protracted 
ERP implementation also often 


linked to accounting and 
financial issues 


Successful 
Outcome


Within the first quarter after our report, CHD 
reported disappointing Q3 sales results, cut 


its full year revenue guidance, and issued Q4 
earnings at $0.54, well below the $0.62 


expected. Management blamed higher sales 
and marketing expenses on FLAWLESS. 


CHD’s new 10-K added risk factors around 
financial controls and it Chief Accounting 


Officer is “retiring”


By early 2016, AMETEK began 
guiding down sales and earnings 


expectations for multiple quarters. 
Its CEO and CFO abruptly retired. Its 
share price fell nearly 20% from our 


initial report date


Q2 2019 missed sales estimates by the 
widest margin in years, and initial 
2020 guidance issued in Q3 2019, 


missed estimates with lower sales and 
earnings growth. Management failed 
to address any of the issues identified 


by Spruce Point. The share price 
corrected by 22%


AOS admitted an undisclosed 
material supply chain partner 


following a report by firm J Capital. 
In Q2 2018, AOS substantially 


revised guidance, showing 
weakness in China with sales 


projected down 16-17%. AOS fired 
its head of China after an 


investigation


“Being an S&P 500 company is a validation of absolutely nothing, and can be a wasteland of corporate mediocrity. It affords 
investors zero protections against companies and their ability to scheme investors. Buyer beware!”

Amcor: Spruce Point Sees Approximately
40% - 60% Downside To US$ 3.60 - US$ 5.40 / Share


• An “Organic” EPS Growth Story Through Suspect Cost Synergies And Obscured Tobacco Dependence: Nearly 10% of sales are tobacco 
cartons, yet Amcor’s recent SEC filings and investor presentations disclose “tobacco” zero times! Based on our research, we learned 
that tobacco cartons once accounted for up to 30% of Amcor’s EBITDA, and may generate margins 1,000bps higher than other 
businesses. Tobacco sales are declining mid-single digits globally, and Amcor has obscured its goodwill and entities associated with 
tobacco packaging acquisitions. Amcor even changed its goodwill impairment testing from “quantitative” to “qualitative” factors in 
2019. Goodwill accounting is a current hot topic for the SEC,  which is investigating Newell Rubbermaid. Other dependencies include 
plastic bottle sales to Pepsi (~8% sales), and packages to Kraft Heinz (~3.5% sales), which is also under SEC investigation. Amcor claims 
$180m of Bemis deal cost synergies and avoids discussion of sales synergies. Based on our analysis, deal costs are rising faster than 
planned, and sales are vanishing. Amcor stopped disclosing Bemis’ sales contribution one full quarter post deal closing. Financial 
reporting practices for material acquisitions are 12 months of post closing disclosure. Our analysis suggests both Bemis and Amcor sales 
are organically declining 3.0% - 4.0% and its cost synergy targets, relative to other industry deals, are very aggressive. Amcor’s claim in 
Feb 2020 that it’s increasing cost synergy guidance from $65m to $80m appears dubious in light of evidence that R&D spending is 
running $35m below plan. Amcor was adamant at the deal announcement that cost synergies would not include R&D cuts.


• Signs of a Cash Crunch Calling Into Question Management’s “Enhanced Financial Profile” Claim: We believe Amcor presents an 
inaccurate view of its cash by obscuring clear presentation of rising cash overdrafts and restricted cash. Recently disclosed European 
filings (30% of sales in Europe) show that Amcor’s cash pool fell into a deficit after a multi-year surplus. Amcor claims rising volumes in 
Europe, yet didn’t disclose intentions to shut two Flexible facilities in Finland. Rising dependence on cash overdrafts has been a major 
harbinger of financial strain in companies we’ve warned about (notably XPO and Maxar Technologies), and also played a part in the 
collapse of the scandal at MDC Partners. Amcor is also intensifying its use of commercial paper (CP), a risky strategy given it was 
recently downgraded by credit agency Fitch, and as a BBB credit, is close to junk status. As a junk credit, Amcor’s access to the CP 
market could be restricted, its cost of capital rise, and its liquidity reduced. Amcor embellishes its liquidity by claiming its CP is “long-
term” debt, but we believe it should be viewed as short-term.


Amcor plc (“AMCR” or “the Company”) is a roll-up, and newly created S&P 500 company, formed through a stock-for-stock merger 
between Amcor (Australia) and Bemis (U.S.). Its shares trade on both on the NYSE: AMCR and ASX: AMC. As two companies in the 


global packaging industry with large exposure to the consumer and beverage industry (PET bottles, plastic bags, tobacco), we 
believe Amcor is facing cost and revenue challenges as the world moves toward healthier and more environmentally conscious 


solutions. Based on our forensic review of the deal rationale touted by Amcor, we are able to disprove or question a majority of its 
promotional selling points. We also believe Amcor is obscuring significant financial strain (organic revenue decline 3.0% - 4.0%, cash 


overdrafts and cash flow contraction) that will place its dividend and BBB investment grade credit rating at risk. 
We see 40% – 60% downside risk as investors recalibrate the long thesis.

• Why Free Cash Flow Won’t Improve And The Dividend Is At Risk: In its recent quarter, Amcor became more aggressive with add-
backs in its free cash flow presentation, a classic sign of strain. The CFO claims cash flow will seasonally improve through June 
2020 (2H’20), but this conflicts with an on the record statement by Bemis’ CEO before the deal closed that its strongest cash
generation is in Q3 (June-Sept). Amcor has said that its 3.5% capex to sales spend is “a healthy amount”, but based on our 
analysis, the average industry capex spend is 5.5%. While all Amcor’s close peers maintain or increase capex spending, we believe 
Amcor is materially underinvesting in the near-term, a strategy that will depress future free cash flow. Pre-deal Amcor said it 
required $400m of annual capex to maintain organic growth. However, our analysis shows legacy Amcor capex is running 30%-35% 
less. We believe Amcor will soon face a crossroads in its financial strategy between completing a $500m share repurchase 
program, increasing capex to remain competitive, and paying a generous $725m/year dividend. Absent a suspension of 
repurchases, we believe Amcor will be unlikely to maintain its current dividend.


• Leverage Is Greater Than It Appears: Amcor does not include leases in its presentation of Net Debt to investors. Leases currently 
amount to $580m, and are now recorded on the Company’s balance sheet. In addition, Amcor has $354m of unfunded employee 
benefit liabilities. Going against Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance, Amcor does not clearly mark restricted cash
amounts in its cash flow statement. However, it disclosed deep in its footnotes that $13.5m was deposited with a Brazilian court
to defend a case. In addition, one rating agency views $150m of cash as restricted and necessary for working capital needs. On the 
surface, the Company tells investors it is levered 2.9x Net Debt / PF Adjusted EBITDA, but with these basic adjustments, we 
estimate leverage is 3.3x


• Unresolved Material Weaknesses And A Chief Accounting Officer That Appears To Have Misrepresented Himself: Amcor 
disclosed two material weakness of accounting, disclosure and financial control matters that haven’t been resolved in 18 months.
The Company hasn’t been specific about areas affected. Based on our review, we find it has made unusual revisions to revenue,
capex, and most alarming, interest income. This bolsters our concerns that cash could be misrepresented. Amcor’s Chief 
Accounting Officer is Jerry S. Krempa, who came from Bemis where his biography publicly states that he is a CPA. However, based 
on our background check, his CPA was listed as “REVOKED” by the state of Minnesota for disciplinary reasons in January 2017. In 
light of our observations, we believe investors should demand a full investigation into Amcor’s financial affairs. 


Investors should have limited confidence in Amcor’s financial reporting given unresolved material weaknesses that 
have lingered for 18 months. We find evidence of revenue, capex and even interest income revisions. Amcor is 


understating its true leverage, and its dividend is not safe even assuming base case market projections come true.  


Amcor: Spruce Point Sees Approximately
40% - 60% Downside To US$ 3.60 - US$ 5.40 / Share

• Poor Insider Alignment And Corporate Governance Practices: In our view, Amcor’s transformation to a global company has 
left it far behind best practices in global corporate governance. Amcor’s insiders own a measly 0.2% of the stock, and show 
signs of acting in their own self-interest. To illustrate, Amcor subtly changed the vesting period for long-term stock 
compensation from 3 to 2 years, consistent with our view that management wants to cash out fast, and is aware the merger is 
underperforming expectations. Amcor measures its performance relative to a basket of Australian companies (most of which 
are not even in the paper/packaging industry). This makes no sense given only ~3% of Amcor’s revenues and assets are in 
Australia. From a governance perspective, we are concerned that Amcor’s lead audit partner at PwC is an industry specialist in 
Pharma and Life Sciences, and not paper/packaging. In addition, the recent audit chair, another senior PwC global executive, 
left abruptly amidst heightened scrutiny in Australia about the closeness of the firm to various Australian company Boards. 


• Few Shareholder Benefits Created By Dual Listing And Slanted Analyst Base: A Poor Risk/Reward Investment Opportunity:  
Investors were sold by management that the deal would create “flow-forward” and new index buying demand from a dual 
U.S./Australian listing. However, based on our analysis we don’t believe this is accurate. We find that Bemis’ top fundamental 
owners have been selling stock. We believe that Amcor has a large Australian retail investor base that is being baited by local 
analysts with overly-optimistic price targets. As noted earlier, despite just ~3% of its business based in Australia, 8 out of 12 
sell-side analysts covering Amcor reside in Australia. The average price target of A$16.59 / US$10.75 implies 19% upside, and 
incorporates management’s commentary at face value that it can pull-off a complicated global merger between two disparate 
cultures, grow revenues 1.5% – 2.0%, while expanding margins and cash flow through multiple different restructuring and 
cost cutting programs. All of this would be difficult to achieve in a normal environment, setting aside global growth fears from
the Coronavirus (Amcor has >$225m of revenue in and around lockdown zones in Italy). Our forensic analysis suggests it may 
be outright impossible for Amcor to meet lofty analyst expectations, with revenues already vanishing, deal costs higher than 
planned, and critical maintenance and growth capital expenditures being delayed.  Amcor’s valuation is in-line with industry 
peers, but should trade at a discount to reflect our documented concerns about the accuracy of its financial statements, 
fragile financial condition and unsustainable dividend policy. Amcor investors should study the recent $5bn 
Westrock/Kapstone packaging deal as a comparable example of what to expect. The combined company has repeatedly 
missed sales forecasts, and is now expected to decline, resulting in significant multiple contraction. Westrock is comparably
levered to Amcor, has higher margins, and also has a ~5% dividend yield. If we applied Westrock and its closest peers sales 
multiple of 1.0x – 1.2x to Amcor, it’s easy to justify 40% – 60% downside risk to Amcor’s share price.

Amcor/Bemis Merger: Disproving The Top 
Promotional Deal Selling Points 


Topic What The Company Has Said Spruce Point Cold Reality


Enhanced 
Financial 


Profile


“Amcor’s financial profile will be enhanced, and our existing 
capital allocation framework, or shareholder value creation 


model, will be maintained and strengthened with this 
transaction”


Recent credit downgrade. Unremedied material weaknesses 
lingering for 18 months and unusual financial restatements. 


Financial presentation stretched to obscure strain, including use of 
bank overdrafts. Wasteful stock buyback and tenuous dividend. 


Adjusted free cash flow declined -50% from June-Dec 2019


Focused 
Portfolio


These criteria have led us to the focused portfolio of strong 
businesses we have today across: flexible and rigid packaging, 


specialty cartons, and closures.


Amcor obscures that specialty cartons is primarily selling cigarette 
cartons. Sales are ~10% of its total business, under long-term 


pressure, and we estimate once contributed 30% of its total EBITDA. 
Amcor obscures goodwill from acquisitions associated with tobacco 
deals, and changed its goodwill impairment test from “quantitative” 


to “qualitative” in 2019


Regulatory 
Issues


“We’ve got a lot of experience navigating through all of that 
[regulatory matters]. We got good advice, good advisors and we 


don’t expect any issues there”


Asset divestitures required from both companies in the 
U.S. (Amcor) and Europe (Bemis)


Capex 
Requirements


Amcor Standalone: “$400m each year to organically maintain 
and grow the Business, and expand earnings” 


Combined: “The business is spending 3.5% of sales, which is a 
healthy amount in any context”


Our analysis suggests 5.5% capex is the industry norm. Our analysis 
shows 30%-35% underspending of capex at legacy Amcor, which 


suggests organic growth business slowdown


Deal 
Transaction 


Costs


“The costs to implement the Transaction are substantial and 
include estimated integration costs of US$150 million, 


approximately US$65 million of compensation costs and 
approximately US$125 million of transaction costs (ex: GST)” 


Amcor’s deal cost reporting indicates over $200m of transaction 
costs already, 60% higher than forecasted. This appears to be more 


than just a casual oversight 


Cost Synergies
“We’re confident in being able to generate $180m 


in cost synergies”
Wasn’t very clear that cost synergies are ”net”. Synergy targets are 


aggressive per our analysis and primary research


Spruce Point has conducted a thorough forensic review of the Amcor / Bemis transaction, including management’s bold 
claims for the transaction. Our analysis either disproves, or calls into question, each of the main selling points.

Amcor/Bemis Merger: Disproving The Top 
Promotional Deal Selling Points  (Cont’d)


Topic What The Company Has Said Spruce Point Cold Reality


Strong 
Combined R&D


“Firstly, we do not intend to pursue synergies through a reduction 
in sales and marketing or R&D costs”


CEO now says its R&D infrastructure is “a little bit uneven”. 
Based on our analysis, we observe that R&D spend is down 
materially from $115m to $83m (-28%). Recent increase in 


synergies from $65m to $80m likely from R&D cuts


Potential Revenue 
Synergies


“We haven’t quantified the benefits of any revenue synergies but 
we would clearly expect to be able to grow at higher rates over 


the longer term than we would independently”


Management has been quiet about underlying organic sales, 
instead focusing on organic EPS growth through cost cutting, 
and potential sales synergies. We believe sales at both Amcor 


and Bemis are declining 3.0% to 4.0%


Strength And 
Improving 


Momentum In 
Latin America


“Comprehensive global footprint in the flexible packaging 
business by bringing together  Amcor’s leading flexible packaging 
businesses in Europe, Asia and many parts of Latin America with 


Bemis’s leading positions in North America and Brazil”


Still talking about Latam challenges and calling it a 
“complicated portfolio”. Continues to perform below 


expectations, and disclosing a cash deposit with a court in 
Brazil for legal issues


Ability To Drive 
Working Capital 


Efficiencies


“One of the consistent highlights for the business has been our 
working capital performance”


Based on our analysis, we believe working capital to sales, and 
DSOs are rising beyond what Bemis/Amcor looked standalone


Shareholder 
Benefits From 


Dual listing And 
Index Inclusion


“We believe that the listing in New York in particular in the multi-
capitalisation which will approach $20 billion once the synergies 
are factored in, will put us sort of mid-way in the S&P500 index 
and create index buying that actually will create flow forward. 


You typically talk about flow back in cross border deals. We 
would expect flow forward”


Our shareholder analysis suggests almost no net buying by 
index/ETF buyers. In fact, the largest fundamental owners of 


Bemis have voted on the transaction by selling stock. The 
largest buyer of Amcor’s stock appears to be the company 
buyback program at poor above market prices averaging 


$10.16 per share


Spruce Point has conducted a thorough forensic review of the Amcor / Bemis transaction, including management’s 
bold claims for the transaction. Our analysis either disproves, or calls into question, each of the main selling points

A Roll-Up Hitting A Wall


Spruce Point believes that Amcor’s roll-up is in its final stages, having merged with Bemis in a $6.8 billion dollar 
transaction – the largest in its recent history. Now as a $20 billion market cap entity, to continue its growth by 


acquisitions, Amcor will have to look for larger targets, few of which exist that will move the needle.


“And our model and our track record has been to acquire. We've done 25-plus deals in the last 6 or 7 years.”

Revenues Synergies or Disynergies: 
Proof That Revenues Declined 3.0% - 4.0% 
Through September 2019


Amcor’s management dangled a carrot to investors of potential revenue synergies, without quantifying them. Based on our 
analysis, which adjusts from the sale of U.S. (Amcor) and European “EC” (Bemis) assets, we estimate that Bemis and legacy 


Amcor were declining 3.0% and 4.0%, respectively, through Sept 2019. The market believes Amcor is a stable grower, capable 
of doing low single digit growth.

Note: Amcor’s 6M Ended 12/31/18 figures changed in its recent SEC 10-Q and were used in the analysis
1) Amcor is ambiguous about the exact nature of these costs, but It is quite possible these costs should be tax-effected at Amcor’s 22% tax rate, which would reduce cash flow further
2) Payments to operating partners appear through the financing section and should be deducted from cash from operations
3) Amcor discloses that forward contracts are used in relation to repurchasing stock for employee compensation which is operating in nature, but classified as a “financing” cash flow by Amcor

Tangible New Evidence of 
Amcor’s Cash Liquidity Challenges


On Jan 28, 2020, Amcor filed a report for its significant European investment holding company subsidiary that provides a snapshot 
of its performance at FY end June 30, 2019. Despite the CEO offering expectations of “winning” in Europe at the beginning of the
year, we find that profits were down materially. Even worse, we find that Amcor’s cash pool swung from a surplus of €62.7m to a 


deficit of -€34.4m. This supports our opinion that Amcor appears to be facing a liquidity crunch. Subsequently, it was reported that 
Amcor Flexibles would shut two plants in Finland, though this was never disclosed to investors in SEC filings.(1)

Dividend At Risk


Spruce Point believes that Amcor’s free cash flow, and commitment to repurchasing shares, leave it little room to protect 
its dividend under current market expectations, which incorporate modest 1% - 2% revenue growth and cost synergy 


realization. However, we’ve illustrated that current growth expectations are high in light of organic decline at both Bemis 
and Amcor in the 3.0% - 4.0% range. In addition, we’ve illustrated that cost synergy projections are aggressive, and that 


management is claiming synergies are ahead of plan despite cutting R&D spending while saying it wouldn’t.

Amcor presents a potentially misleading view of its leverage by not including capital leases, and not clearly displaying 
how much cash is restricted for legal disputes, overdrafts and/or working capital needs. The Company says its leverage 


is 2.9x Net Debt / EBITDA, but we estimate leverage is closer to 3.3x. Amcor was recently downgraded by Fitch in 
February 2020 from BBB+ to BBB, yet it expects revenues to increase low single digits in the coming years. We believe 


this forecast is already proving to be overly-optimistic.

Amcor Chief Accounting Officer Is Not A 
CPA, Contrary To Public Representation


In light of its material weaknesses of financial control and accounting, and unusual revisions to revenues, capex and 
interest income, we have serious concerns about the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer (CAO). Mr. Krempa, as the 
former Bemis CAO, recently listed on his biography his CPA designation. Yet, after a background check, we observe 


that it was “REVOKED” by the state of Minnesota in 2017. He signed Amcor’s recent 10-K Annual Report.

Evidence of Growing Business 
Challenges In Core Markets

Our View of Amcor / Bemis: 
A Merger of Desperation


Spruce Point believes the stock-for-stock merger of Amcor + Bemis was a deal done out of necessity for survival. It illustrates 
that neither company would stake its own capital to acquire the other. Furthermore, reading between the lines, management 
has been selling “organic EPS growth” through cost synergies and not “organic revenue growth” through revenue synergies 


as a financial driver behind the deal. With significant customer concentration among large CPGs under stress, and pressure to
reduce environmentally unfriendly packaging materials falling on Amcor, we believe it will come under more stress.


“Sales to the Kraft Heinz Company, and its subsidiaries, accounted for approximately 11 percent in 2018 and 10 
percent in 2017 and 2016. The Company primarily sells to Kraft Heinz Company in the U.S. Packaging segment.” (1)

Long-Term Industry Headwinds 


Amcor is under pressure as demand from its customers is shrinking as they shift towards more eco-friendly solutions 
with higher recycled plastic content. We believe Amcor’s large customers will pressure its suppliers to absorb the 


increased cost of developing new products, negatively affecting Amcor. Amcor has made commitments to develop all of 
its packaging to be recyclable or reusable by 2025. It’s a noble endeavor, but at what cost to shareholders? 


“Coke and Pepsi abandon the plastics lobby”
“Coca-Cola and PepsiCo, two major sellers of plastic bottles, have made sweeping sustainability commitments. Now they 
are stepping away from a plastics lobbying group. Both soft drink companies are trying to increase the amount of recycled 
plastic they use in bottles. They want to improve recycling infrastructure and ensure their packages are recyclable.”

Obscuring Substantial Tobacco Dependence


Amcor appears to be taking steps to obscure its exposure to tobacco carton sales. Understandably, tobacco has been linked to 
cancer, and Amcor may not want to associate itself with this product. Industry sources suggest that tobacco sales are declining low 
to mid single digits in the U.S. and globally.(1,2) During the course of our research, we learned that cigarette cartons may have once 
accounted for up to 30% of Amcor’s total EBITDA.(3) Amcor hasn’t used the word “tobacco” in any of its post-closing SEC filings, 


and only reports “specialty carton” sales on an annual, not quarterly basis. Amcor gives limited color on carton segment 
performance in its MD&A, leaving investors in the dark about recent business performance.  Its investor presentation shows an


ambiguous picture under “specialty cartons” that appears nothing like a pack of cigarettes.

Below Industry Growth Projected


Amcor’s merger document filed in Australia in early 2019 used expert projections claiming that global average plastic 
packaging growth would be 3.7% p.a. through 2023. Yet, it is already clear that the market doesn’t believe these 


forecasts. Amcor is projected by equity analysts to grow 1.5% – 2.0%, but we estimate organic decline at 3.0% – 4.0%. 
EBITDA margins are projected to expand, despite tobacco packaging, an above average profit driver, declining mid-


single digits.  Why should investors be excited to invest in Amcor when it is projected (by generally over-bullish sell-side 
analysts) to grow below industry expert projections?


From Amcor Scheme Booklet: “Over the five years to 2023, global packaging industry revenue is expected to grow at an average of 2.9% per 
annum to US$1,046 billion.50 Plastic packaging is expected to experience the strongest growth compared to other types of packaging, increasing by 
an average of 3.7% per annum to US$367 billion,39 as a result of the increasing popularity of plastics such as PET51 that provide a more lightweight 
option to meet the dual goal of reduced material consumption and cost and reduced carbon footprint during transit. This is further supported by 
demand from consumers as they perceive smaller and more lightweight packaging as being more environmentally friendly. The projected annual 
average growth in the plastic packaging industry by region is illustrated as follows.”

Quickly Obscuring Bemis Contribution


Amcor closed the acquisition of Bemis on June 11, 2019. Best disclosure practices for material acquisitions generally require
providing financial contribution of the target for the next 12 months. Yet, we find that by Amcor has omitted disclosure of Bemis after 
one full quarter. It becomes clearer that with the last reported quarterly Bemis revenue of $970m (add $25.7m for divested assets) that 


proxy projections for $4.1bn of sales in 2019 likely fell short. Yet, management is still claiming organic growth.

“The acquisition of Bemis positions the Company as a global leader in consumer packaging with a comprehensive global footprint in 
flexible packaging and greater scale in key regions of North America, Latin America, Asia Pacific and Europe, along with industry-

Revenues Synergies or Disynergies: 
Proof That Revenues Declined 3.0% - 4.0% 
Through September 2019


Amcor’s management dangled a carrot to investors of potential revenue synergies, without quantifying them. Based on our 
analysis, which adjusts from the sale of U.S. (Amcor) and European “EC” (Bemis) assets, we estimate that Bemis and legacy 


Amcor were declining 3.0% and 4.0%, respectively, through Sept 2019. The market believes Amcor is a stable grower, capable 
of doing low single digit growth.

Europe Is Under Pressure


Amcor appears to be struggling in Europe, where ~30% of its sales are located. We find evidence that its cash pools fell into a deficit from a 
multi-year surplus. The CEO also claimed the European flexible volumes increased, yet Amcor did not disclose that two Flexible facilities 
were to be shut down in Finland by June 2020. This suggests it has excess capacity in Europe. Reported European sales declined 3% YoY 


in the last three months of 2019. If volumes are increasing as the CEO says, then pricing must have significantly deteriorated. The Euro 
currency rose ~3% during the last quarter of the year, which should have helped Amcor since it reports in US dollars.

Latin America Disaster


One area that has certainly struggled is Latin America, falling below expectations dating back to pre-acquisition Bemis. CEO Delia 
touted Bemis’ “leading position” in Brazil, and costs have been continually removed, yet he is now saying the portfolio is 


“complicated” as legal costs escalate.


“Latin America operating profit trended down during the fourth quarter and full-year as compared to last year, driven by the continued challenging 
economic environment in Brazil, that is putting pressure on unit volumes and mix of products sold. Fourth quarter profit performance in our Latin 
America business was in line with our expectations. We have reduced both variable and fixed costs in our Latin America business, which has 
driven profit improvement since the low point during the second quarter of 2017. Conditions are stabilizing in Brazil, and we expect 
improving profitability in '18 and beyond from the actions we have taken.”


Bemis
Q4 2017


Ended Dec


“Turning to Latin America Packaging. Sales and profits were in line with our revised expectations for 2018. Organic sales, which exclude the 
impact of currency, were up 4.5% in 2018, reflecting increased price and mix, partially offset by unit volume decline of 9%, which is primarily driven 
by the laundry detergent packaging volume in Brazil that is converting to another packaging format.


Bemis
Q4 2018 


Ended Dec


“Yes. This relates to the Flexibles business in Latin America and in particular, the legacy Bemis business, which we flagged a few times now. First 
of all, what we are doing -- well, let's set the context first. So before the acquisition closed, the business wasn't performing at a very high level. In the 
quarter or 2 before close, it had deteriorated a bit, lost some sales and ended up in a fiscal fourth quarter last year losing money, which we 
flagged. So -- and we got a hold of the business in mid-June last year. And the first thing that happened was we took a lot of costs out, and we've 
taken headcount way down. We're looking at the footprint as well. So those actions were taken very early on. And the business is improving from a 
profit perspective with each month, so it's absolutely improved quarter-over-quarter. It's actually improving month-over-month from a profit 
perspective despite the fact that the sales take longer to regenerate. It always takes a lot longer to regain sales than it does to lose them. And so in 
addition to the cost actions we've taken, we're working hard on getting the top line back to where it can and should be and has been in the 
past. So that would be the other thing. And then the third thing I would point out is we probably flagged this before, but it's a fairly complicated 
portfolio as we see it. We try to keep things even more focused and more simple. And that business functions, when I say the business, the legacy 
Bemis business in particular, in a number of segments that we haven't historically been in. And so we're taking a close look at that as well. We took 
one step in the first half. We sold out of a joint venture we had to produce tube laminates in Brazil. It's a small business, good business, very good 
business but just not one that we're in anywhere else in the world. And so we sold out of that JV as a step towards simplifying that portfolio a little bit 
further. So it's combination cost and getting the top line going again and making sure we're focused from a portfolio perspective.”

taking steps to reduce the complexity in that business…In Latin America, volumes were 2% higher. However, earnings were lower than the

Lingering Material Weakness


Amcor has had two unresolved material weakness of accounting, disclosure and financial control matters. The Company 
has not resolved the issue over the course of 18 months. Investors should demand more accountability. 


Source: First disclosed 10/29/18 Form S4 and still unresolved as of recent 10-Q 2/11/20


“As previously disclosed under “Item 9A. - Controls and Procedures” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for our fiscal year 
ended June 30, 2019 filed with the SEC on September 3, 2019, we identified two material weaknesses in our internal control 
over financial reporting during the conversion of our historical AAS financial statements to U.S. GAAP. The first material 
weakness was related to our lack of accounting staff and supervisory personnel with the appropriate level of 
experience in technical accounting in U.S. GAAP and disclosure and filing requirements of a U.S. domestic registrant. 
We also identified a second material weakness arising from deficiencies in the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal controls over the period end reporting process. Specifically, we did not design and maintain effective controls to 
verify that conflicting duties were appropriately segregated within key IT systems used in the preparation and reporting of 
financial information.


Our management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness 
of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2019. The term "disclosure controls and procedures," as defined 
in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means 
controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a 
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within 
the time periods specified in the SEC's rules and forms. Disclosure controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls 
and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including its principal executive and financial 
officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. There are inherent limitations to the 
effectiveness of any system of disclosure controls and procedures, including the possibility of human error and the 
circumvention or overriding of the controls and procedures. Accordingly, even effective disclosure controls and procedures can 
only provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed 
to provide reasonable assurance of achieving their control objectives.


As a result of the existing material weaknesses noted above, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer 
concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2019.”

Unusual Revenue Restatement


Amcor’s financial control issues appear to affect its revenue and cost recognition policies. We find that revenues for 
the six months ended Dec 2018 were revised lower by $2.2m and also don’t match previous Australian filings from H2 


2019 by $6.2m. Cost of goods sold are also off by $1.6m. Amcor made a brief and unusual statement connecting 
interest expense to net sales.

“The Company reclassified prior year comparative figures in the condensed consolidated statement of cash flows to conform to 
the current year’s presentation. In addition, the Company reclassified certain prior year comparative figures from interest 
expense to net sales to conform to the current year’s presentation. This change in presentation did not have an impact on the 
Company’s financial condition or operating results.”

Amcor Not Recession Resistant


Though Amcor serves a mix of companies in defensive food, beverage, personal care, tobacco and healthcare industries, it is not 
immune to a potential recession. It will likely experience declining results much greater than the industries it serves.

Evidence of A Liquidity Crunch
39


Warning: CP Dependence Rising


We observe that Amcor has become more aggressive in its usage and financial presentation of commercial paper (CP). CP is short-
term borrowing, typically for less than 270 days. However, Amcor recently elected to classify all of its CP as a Long-Term Debt, 


claiming it has “an intent to refinance such obligations for the long-term”. This aggressive classification makes Amcor’s liquidity 
appear better than it actually is. Yet, the CP market is generally open only to the strongest companies, with investment grade (IG) 


credit ratings. Amcor’s credit rating is BBB, putting it on the cusp between IG and junk status. If its financial condition worsens, or 
credit markets worsen, Amcor’s access to the CP market could be materially restricted.(1)

Having To Borrow Commercial Paper To Pay Down 
Long-Term Debt Is Worrisome. Why Couldn’t Amcor Issue More LT Debt?


“Credit rating — A downgrade in our credit rating could increase our borrowing costs and negatively affect our financial 
condition and results of operations:  In addition to using cash provided by operations, we regularly issue commercial paper to 
meet our short-term liquidity needs. Our credit ratings are important to our ability to issue commercial paper at favorable rates of 
interest. A downgrade in our credit rating could increase the cost of borrowing or the fees associated with our bank credit facility, or 
the credit spread incurred when issuing long-term debt in the capital markets.”

Working Capital Deterioration: Part I


Spruce Point believes that Bemis had much worse working capital than Amcor, and not simply 2x Amcor’s as suggested 
by an analyst. Over the preceding, six quarters prior to deal closing, we calculate Bemis’ working capital to sales ratio 


averaged 13%. Amcor’s working capital was around zero.


Gandler: “Okay, great. And last question. Bemis’ working capital to sales is twice Amcor’s, roughly twice 
Amcor’s. Is there something structural there or is that an opportunity you guys have identified as well?


CEO Delia: “I would say it’s an opportunity we’ve identified as well…. Look, is it going to get to our level? I 
don’t know. But what we see without question, without hesitation is there is the cash synergy opportunity from 
optimising working capital.”

Working Capital Deterioration: Part II 


Spruce Point has always advocated to evaluate corporate working capital excluding cash and equivalents. This is particularly 
important in the case of Amcor given our belief its cash is overstated by inclusion of overdrafts at a minimum. Pre-acquisition, Amcor 
also evaluated working capital ex: cash(1). Post-acquisition, they have not given any calculations, but are claiming it has improved on 


a “like-for-like basis” (whatever that means). By our estimate, working capital to sales has worsened materially.


1) Amcor FY 2018 Annual Report p.10
2) We take the mathematical addition of Amcor/Bemis revenues and working capital balance sheet accounts
3) Amcor reported $215.4m of Bemis revenues from deal closing on June 11, 2019 in its $2.59bn revenue quarter. Given Bemis had flat revenue trends of ~$1bn per quarter, we add an 


incremental $784.1m to Amcor’s June 2019 quarter


“One of the consistent highlights for the business has been our working capital performance. And on a like-for-like basis, the 
working capital to sales ratio has improved by 30 basis points in the half to 10.4%. We will maintain our focus in this area to 
reduce this ratio further over time.”

Cash Is Not What It Appears


Amcor changed its presentation of cash post-closing of the transaction. We observe Amcor has been increasing usage of cash 
overdrafts (up from $4m, $78m to $103m in the past 3yrs), a sign of financial strain in our view. Cash overdrafts should be 
netted against total cash. Amcor used to present this correctly in 2018. However, post-deal closing, Amcor no longer nets 


overdrafts. We believe this is a clear overstatement, and obscures its liquidity and financial condition. Amcor doesn’t disclose 
its overdraft on a quarterly basis, or separately report changes in overdraft through its financing section as required by FASB.

Restricted Cash And Flawed Presentation


We believe Amcor’s Statement of Cash Flow does not comply with FASB guidelines as it does not show restricted cash 
movements. Amcor also buried a disclosure in Note 16 that it has deposited cash with a Brazilian court to defend a 


case. How can this not be considered restricted cash?


“The Company's operations in Brazil are involved in various governmental assessments, principally related to claims for excise and 
income taxes. The Company does not believe that the ultimate resolution of these matters will materially impact the Company's
consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Under customary local regulations, the Company's Brazilian 
subsidiaries may need to post cash or other collateral if a challenge to any administrative assessment proceeds to the Brazilian
court system; however, the level of cash or collateral already pledged or potentially required to be pledged would not significantly impact 
the liquidity of Amcor. At December 31, 2019 and June 30, 2019As of December 31, 2019, Amcor provided letters of credit of $43.6
million and deposited cash of $13.5 million with the courts to continue to defend the cases.”  (10-Q 12/31/19, Note 16)


“The amendments in this Update require that a statement of cash flows explain the change during the period in the total of 
cash, cash equivalents, and amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. Therefore, amounts 
generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when


reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement of cash flows. The amendments in 
this Update do not provide a definition of restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents.” (Source: FASB)

Tangible New Evidence of 
Amcor’s Cash Liquidity Challenges


On Jan 28, 2020, Amcor filed a report for its significant European investment holding company subsidiary that provides a snapshot 
of its performance at FY end June 30, 2019. Despite the CEO offering expectations of “winning” in Europe at the beginning of the
year, we find that profits were down materially. Even worse, we find that Amcor’s cash pool swung from a surplus of €62.7m to a 


deficit of -€34.4m. This supports our opinion that Amcor appears to be facing a liquidity crunch. Subsequently, it was reported that 
Amcor Flexibles would shut two plants in Finland, though this was never disclosed to investors in SEC filings.(1)

Cash Taken At Face Value


Data providers have taken Amcor’s cash at face value and do not adjust, or at least discuss, the presence of bank 
overdrafts or legal deposits that might restrict cash. This leads to incorrect conclusions about Amcor’s liquidity.

Therefore, we view management’s cost synergy targets as aggressive, which poses above average risk to investors that 
synergies fall short of plan.

Expert Call On Amcor’s Cost Program


We spoke with a former employee familiar with Amcor’s North American procurement and cost savings initiatives. We 
heard a first hand opinion that the Company is aggressive with suppliers, and has already picked “low hanging fruit” 


on the Amcor side of the business over the years. In addition we learned through second hand conversation that 
innovation was difficult at Amcor through a long product development process. 


“One of the systems they have actually, I would say it’s an initiative that really expanded and became very big. Is called procure plus 
solely focused around cost savings and they have multiple teams that work created around that. And you are responsible for managing 
cost savings and finding cost savings opportunities. It means each plant should have some sort of cost savings opportunity or you know, 
your key strategic suppliers have to deliver cost savings to meet the goal after several years. In my personal opinion, I thought this 
became, very challenging because you cannot continue to save, you know, 10% or whatever percent was it just say on average 10 to 15% 
year over year when you already picked up all the low hanging fruit…..especially when you merge with a company and your supplier base, 
is very fragmented where you have a lot of mom and pop regional supplier shops that you have to figure out how to consolidate into larger 
companies. And sometimes it's not really possible because they manufacture very unique, small things. But we forced suppliers, with a 
very serious extended payment terms, 90 days and some small suppliers just have a very, very difficult time with that. So I personally 
didn't like that approach, but that was the company direction.(1) The cost savings program became very strenuous for a lot of people. I'm 
not saying bad things about them or that it’s not a a great company, but at some point you have to be reasonable in what to expect. There 
is only so much monetary flexibility suppliers are willing to give you.”

Culture At

“What I also know on the new product development, because I worked with a few engineers, and kind of became friends and went out to 
lunch so I can hear their challenges. And they said that when we launched a new bottle, it just takes forever to get it to the market. Just the 
process internal process was so broken that it takes forever. And, a lot of customers don't want to wait for that. You know, you go and do 
all this and we're talking about, for example, like little shampoos or lotions, new bottles like that or maybe promotional drinks. You know, 
you have to have something for Halloween, you'd have to get something for Christmas and maybe Easter at Amcor, you'd have to develop 
them like two years in advance to get it to market. And, because we have to test it, they can do the drawing, but the testing piece on the 
equipment, it was most challenging for them to make sure that bottle actual works and tweaking and tweaking and tweaking, was
constant. So I think that's a drawback for Amcor to get actually the new type of revolutionary bottle that the customer wants, and they want 
them quick. Amcor just struggled with that.”

Deal Costs Expectations


We believe there are significant cost over-runs in the Amcor / Bemis transaction. In particular, the Company forecasted 
$125m of transaction costs.


16. Compensation costs comprise Bemis employee entitlement and retention costs and transaction costs reflect acquisition costs, such as advisory, legal and accounting expenses.
17. Estimated costs to be incurred up to the Scheme Meeting on 2 May 2019.


Note: GST = Goods and Services Tax which Amcor later says, “It is anticipated that New Amcor will maintain ISE status and the New Amcor board intends to conduct the business 
of the combined company such that no GST will be incurred by New Amcor.”


“Integration, compensation and transaction costs are substantial. The costs to implement the Transaction are substantial and 
include estimated integration costs of US$150 million, approximately US$65 million of compensation costs and 
approximately US$125 million of transaction costs16(excluding GST). Both integration and transaction cash costs are 
expected to be broadly offset by savings in capital expenditure and working capital over a similar time period (refer to Sections 
10.3.2 and 10.3.3 of this report). A significant portion of transaction costs (US$45 million17) will be incurred by Amcor (stand-alone) 
regardless of whether the Transaction is implemented.”


Amcor Scheme 
Booklet


March 13, 2019


Amcor anticipates the following costs as a result of the Transaction:


• integration costs (i.e. to achieve synergies) of approximately US$150 million, which are expected to be predominantly incurred 
in the first two years following the close of the Transaction, and


• compensation and transaction costs comprising approximately US$65 million of compensation costs (including Bemis 
employee entitlement and retention costs) and approximately US$125 million of transaction costs (including acquisition costs,
such as advisory, legal and accounting expenses)(excluding GST), which are expected to be predominantly incurred in the first
year following the close of the Transaction.


These cash costs are expected to be broadly offset by working capital and capital expenditure savings over a similar time frame

Deal Costs Reality: Exploding


Recall from an earlier slide, the expectation of “approximately US$125 million of transaction costs” related to the Bemis 
deal were stated by Amcor. However, per our estimate, more than $200 million of costs have been incurred. 


With costs 60% higher than forecasted, this appears to be more than just a casual oversight. 
Even with two unplanned divestitures netting ~$610m (and assuming a very high estimate of $12m for transaction costs 


or 2% of deal value) there are still significant unplanned and unaccounted for costs.

Cost Synergies…Right?


The CEO touted cost synergies in G&A heavily while selling the transaction. Yet, as evidenced by the audit fees pre-
and post-acquisition, costs soared beyond what investors should have expected. Bemis ($4.4m) + Amcor ($7.9m) 
standalone = $12.3m  vs. the actual amount of $20.8m. Granted some additional costs were assumed for one-time 


services for the registration filings, but we fail to see how this could amount to an additional $8.5m of costs.  


Source: Amcor proxy statement Source: Bemis proxy statement


“And then the third source of cost synergies is in G&A. And I want to just repeat something I said earlier, and there is an 
element of conservatism here because we’ve excluded the commercial side of the business for the purposes of assessing 
the opportunity here. We’ve gone at a very detailed level through the duplication in corporate costs that arises when two 
public companies come together and the duplication and operational costs associated with running regional businesses 
in two separate companies. And we’ve been able to pencil out exactly what that opportunity represents.”

Were Synergies Misrepresented?


From the deal onset, Amcor talked about $180 million of cost synergies. The SEC even questioned the Company about  
its free cash flow representation that included synergies, but excluded costs to achieve them.(1)


Recent presentations now include a footnote. 


Source: Amcor/Bemis Deal Presentation (Aug 2018) 
1. SEC Comment Letter: March 6, 2019


“Now the team at Bemis and Amcor have worked together to identify and evaluate the cost synergies related to this combination and on slide 14 
we've laid out some of the details related to those synergies. Based on this work together we’re confident in being able to generate $180 
million in cost synergies. This is around 4-5% of Bemis’s sales. And our experience in carrying out over 20 acquisitions in the last five years in 
Amcor indicates to us that’s the right level for a complementary combination like this one. And I’d like to highlight a couple of other points related 
to synergies. Firstly, we do not intend to pursue synergies through a reduction in sales and marketing or R&D costs. And as you’ve heard from 
both of us we view this as a very significant source of value and we want to protect the commercial side of the business. Secondly the savings 
are incremental to current cost savings and operational improvement initiatives underway, in particular Bemis’s agility programme. So these 
synergy benefits are additive. And finally, the $180 million includes cost synergies only. We have a great track record delivering acquisition 
synergies and of course we [inaudible] our performance target. In addition, we've not factored any addition revenue synergies into the transaction 
metrics, so we see a couple of big areas of upside from here.”

R&D Also Appears Misguided


At deal announcement, Amcor was adamant that cost synergies would not entail R&D reductions, and it touted its $115m 
combined R&D spend as part of its “enhanced financial profile”. Yet, now the CEO is saying that its R&D infrastructure is 
“a little bit uneven”. Based on our analysis, we observe that R&D spend is down materially from $115m to $83m (-28%). 


Amcor just pulled forward its synergy expectation in 2020 by $15m, but can this be trusted in light of our findings?

Based on a forensic review of Amcor and Bemis’ statements on capex, we believe it is materially underspending either 
to boost near-term cash flow, or in support of our view, that its business is in rapid organic decline.


“David, we have been spending at just a tad above D&A. And this year in 2018, we’ve brought it down significantly below D&A. Primarily in North America, 
we have been reinvesting to recapitalise older pieces of equipment. So, we have put in a new piece of equipment that takes the volume and has the 
throughput and output of four pieces of equipment. We send those four pieces of equipment to the scrap, take the cost out recapitalise with new. We’ve done 
that over the last few years. In 2018, we backed off and we are absorbing that incremental throughput and output that we’ve put in over the last few years. 
So, we’re down in the CAPEX cycle based on the fact that we have been recapitalising North America.”

“David, I just want to come back to the point about capital because I just wanted to mention the comment that I made. This is a business that combined will 
have $9 billion in flexible packaging sales, globally. And typically, in these businesses, you’d spend about 4% of sales each year on capital, right? So, 
the math would suggest $350 million to $400 million of CAPEX. In a period of intense integration activity like this, you may spend $50 million, $60 
million, $70 million less for the first couple of years each year. That still means the business is spending 3.5% of sales, which is a healthy amount 
in any context, but we believe conservatively more than offsets the cost to integrate the two businesses and realise the synergies. That was our experience 
with the Alcan acquisition.”


“Okay. Where are you at – and where would Bemis be at in terms of its CAPEX cycle? You mentioned that there is CAPEX savings to be had because you’ve 
been focused on integration. But how much have they spent in recent years etc. on their plant that would allow you the luxury of not spending extra CAPEX to 
get them up to the state that you want them to be in? And that would cause a drain on sales. So, can you give a bit of an overview on where you see them at 
their CAPEX cycle and whether this integration could actually be a potential risk where you’re not spending the capital where you should be?”


“Yeah. Salvator, we were right on target with where we've expected to be with our CapEx plans in 2018, we didn't delay any major projects. If you go back 
2015, 2016, 2017, we brought in a lot of new capital. So, in 2018, we slowed a little bit because we wanted to absorb that capital that we had put in. And as 
we go forward, you should continue to think about the capital plans here as one-times D&A. So, we're talking somewhere between the $150 million to 
$180 million level of CapEx as you go forward.”

“Hi, guys. So, firstly, I wanted to ask a little bit about the CapEx, it seems it was a little bit lighter than expected this year and I wanted to understand a little 
bit, were there any projects that were delayed or anything else going on there and is there kind of any indication of where CapEx is expected to go in 2019?”


“And we invest at about depreciation level in terms of CapEx or, call it, 4% of sales.”

“I think previously, you talked about D&A being similar to CapEx in the kind of $450 million range. It looks like after stripping out the amortization from deals, 
it was only $96 million in 2Q and kind of ran just a little bit north of $200 million in the first half.”


Analyst
H2’20 Call
Feb 2020


“Look, yes, typically, we would spend CapEx kind of in line with depreciation, so around that $450 million mark. We're a little behind that in the first half, 
just slightly behind. I think that's pretty typical when you're doing an integration of the size that we're doing with Bemis. We'd expect that we're going to be 
there or thereabouts by the full year at this stage, might be slightly lower, but that's what you should expect to see.”

Easy To Refute Amcor’s Capex Claims


Amcor’s CEO proclaimed on the deal announcement call that spending 3.5% of sales on capex is “a healthy amount in any 
context”.  Yet, when we sanity check his statement by benchmarking recent capex spending by industry peers, we find his 
statement hard to justify on any grounds. We analyzed industry capex spending over the past four years and find average 


spending to be in the range of 5.5%. Only 2 of 15 companies spend less than 4% and only none spend less than 3.5%.

What Peers Say On Capex


While Amcor has been underspending on capex, all of its closest peers are increasing or maintaining capital spending.


“Capital expenditures of $60 to $70 million are forecasted for 2020 (up from $58m). To secure future organic growth 
prospects, cash resources will be put towards capital projects that significantly elevate the Company’s material science 
acumen and technical capabilities with new production technologies and processes to drive the development of 
recyclable/reusable products that North American customers are now trying to effectively source.”  Source

Capex Shortfall Signals Organic Decline In 
Its Underlying Business


Amcor stated pre-Bemis closing that $400m of capex is necessary to support organic growth. By adjusting its LTM 2019 results for
the contribution of Bemis and divestment of U.S. and European assets, we estimate legacy Amcor capex is running at $258 -


$277m, or approximately 30%-35% below plan. We believe this underinvestment points to material organic decline in legacy Amcor.

To support our view that Amcor’s revenue is declining organically, we point out that the Company’s “Reinvestment” is listed at $500m 
(recall $400m was needed for just Amcor standalone and $150-$185m was stated by Bemis).

Amcor’s financial control issues appear to extend to capital expenditures. Capex in 2018 was mysteriously revised lower, which lends

Free Cash Flow Overstatement And 
Looming Leverage Problems
69


Aggressive Free Cash Flow Presentation


We view Amcor’s Adjusted Free Cash Flow as highly aggressive. Notably, they add back proceeds from asset sales to 
report “Net Capex”. In addition Amcor, as a frequently acquisitive Company that has done 25 deals in the past few years, 


also would like investors to ignore transaction and integration costs. We also observe that Amcor has become more 
aggressive with its recent Adjusted Free Cash Flow presentation, now adding back cash from divested operations 


(a non-recurring source). 


Why is AMCR now trying to claim a cash flow benefit from divested 
operations, when it didn’t the previous quarter? Furthermore, why 


should cash from a divested operations be viewed as “continuing” and 
part of AMCR’s adjusted cash flow which tries to also remove 


transaction and integration costs


Source: H2 2020 resultsSource: Q1 20 results


Recent Adjusted 
Free Cash Flow


Notice the footnote addition clarifying that $45m of $112m are “cash 
integration costs”. Does this mean that the rest are transaction costs, or 


at worst, non-cash add-backs?

Irreconcilable Add Backs


There’s an inability to reconcile “material transaction costs” add-backs between the cash flow and income statement. 
Our major concern is that the add-back to cash flow is significantly higher than the income statement representation. 


It is also difficult to determine if Amcor’s add-back to cash flow for deal costs are pre or post-tax costs. The tax treatment 
of deal transaction costs, at least in the U.S., can be complex and open to interpretation.(1)


Source: FY 2019 press release results


At best $47.9m and $133.7m (=$181.6) are actual cash costs that could 
be added back to cash flow. 


The $204.8m does not appear anywhere in AMCR’s actual 10-K filing, 
nor is it discussed on the conference call

Unusual Cash Flow Revisions


Based a review of Amcor’s financial statements, we find its cash flow statement for the 6 months ended Dec 31st changed and was 
revised higher, despite the Sept 30th ended period being revised lower.(1) The Company claims revisions did not have an impact on 
the operating results. Yet, there are clear revisions to net income, depreciation and amortization expense, with the net result being 


optically higher cash flow. Furthermore, the MD&A says recent cash flow improvements were from “impacts of Bemis”. 
Notably, the language does not speak to any improvements or benefits from Amcor’s legacy business.

Amcor Claims Cash Flow Will Improve In 
The Second Half…Not So Fast!


Spruce Point believes that Amcor’s cash flow in the first half of calendar year 2020 (second half of its FY end June 30, 2020) 
will disappoint. Amcor’s CFO proclaimed that it has better cash flow in the second half of its year (Jan – June). Whereas, 


Bemis CEO is on record saying that Bemis’ best cash flow is always Q3 (June – September). Therefore, we struggle to see 
how cash flow will improve over the next six months given that it is the weakest period for Bemis. In addition, we’ve also 


illustrated how Bemis’ revenues have been declining, making it even more likely that cash flow will be pressured.

plan rolls out in the back half of this year. Q3 is again our seasonally highest quarter, traditionally our highest 
quarter, and it is higher this year as it has been in all the past years.”

“Typically, our cash flow is much stronger in the second half, and we'll -- we typically have higher earnings in the 
second half, so there's some seasonality there. We expect there'll be some working capital improvements, as we've 
seen in the first half, that will continue to flow in the second. So look, generally speaking, that's the normal trend we 
see. And that's what we expect for the second half, more around seasonality.”

Dividend At Risk


Spruce Point believes that Amcor’s free cash flow, and commitment to repurchasing shares, leave it little room to protect 
its dividend under current market expectations, which incorporate modest 1-2% revenue growth and cost synergy 


realization. However, we’ve illustrated that current growth expectations are high in light of organic decline at both Bemis 
and Amcor in the 3.0% - 3.5% range. In addition, we’ve illustrated that cost synergy projections are aggressive, and that 


management is claiming synergies are ahead of plan despite cutting R&D spending while saying it wouldn’t.

Amcor presents a potentially misleading view of its leverage by not including capital leases, and not clearly displaying 
how much cash is restricted for legal disputes, overdrafts and/or working capital needs. The Company says its leverage 


is 2.9x Net Debt / EBITDA, but we estimate leverage is closer to 3.3x. Amcor was recently downgraded by Fitch in 
February 2020 from BBB+ to BBB, yet it expects revenues to increase low single digits in the coming years. We believe 


this forecast is already proving to be overly-optimistic.

Amcor Chief Accounting Officer Is Not A 
CPA, Contrary To Public Representation


In light of its material weaknesses of financial control and accounting, and unusual revisions to revenues, capex and 
interest income, we have serious concerns about the Company’s Chief Accounting Officer. Mr. Krempa, as the former 
Bemis CAO, recently listed on his biography his CPA designation. Yet, after a background check, we observe that it 


was “REVOKED” by the state of Minnesota in 2017. He signed Amcor’s recent 10-K Annual Report.

Audit Chair Leaves Under Unusual 
Circumstances


Spruce Point has always warned to be wary when the relationship between the Company and auditor are very close. 
In Amcor’s case, we observe that Paul Brasher, its Audit Chair, was Chairman of the Global Board at PwC. 


The close relationship became the focus of an AFR article in March 2019, and Brasher left the Board in Sept 2019. 


Source: Amcor proxy statement 


Source: Australian Financial Review “PwC Fears Payments Issue Will Go Global”, March 22, 2019


“Paul Brasher, a Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee, will retire from the Board on September 30, 2019”Amcor Proxy Statement


“Fears that PwC Australia’s burgeoning conflict-of-interest controversy over retirement payments made to former partners 
will spread to overseas member firms is piling pressure on local leadership to resolve the widening issue.


The firm on Friday denied that the global board had become involved, even as AFR Weekend identified another ex-partner who 
is receiving payments from the firm and working as an audit committee head at a listed company where the auditor is also PwC.


The PwC engagement with Amcor, along with the previously identified Vocus where a similar arrangement is in place, are 
estimated to be worth about $13 million in audit and non-audit fees to PwC.


Amcor, where former PwC senior partner Paul Brasher is head of the audit committee, declined to comment.


Amcor are unable to provide comment on your questions," a spokesman said.


In 2018, Mr Brasher received US$221,807 ($312,140) as a director of Amcor. In the same financial year, PwC's received US$8.1 
million ($11.5 million) in fees from Amcor for audit and non-audit work.”

Insiders Have Very Little “At Risk”


Insiders (management and the Board) own a pathetic 3.6m shares or just 0.2% of total shares outstanding. 
Their alignment with shareholders is virtually zero. We believe insiders are more incentivized to preserve their jobs, 


and Company perquisites than create upside.

Accelerated Bonus Vesting?


Given our belief that the Bemis / Amcor transaction is struggling, and management is likely aware of the operational and 
financial challenges it faces, we observe that management was granted a two year vesting period (instead of a typical 
three year period) for stock related to its recent long-term incentive program. Allowing management to receive vested 


stock faster, is a strong signal that insider want to unload stock fast. 


LONG-TERM INCENTIVE GRANTS DURING FISCAL YEAR 2019:


“In fiscal year 2019, the regular annual LTI grant was delayed until the completion of the Transaction. The 
transaction closed late in fiscal year 2019, resulting in this award being granted after the end of fiscal year 2019. 
Given the timing of the grant, the award will have a two year vesting period rather than the standard three year 
vesting period. This award will be disclosed alongside the fiscal year 2020 LTI grant in the 2020 report.”

Audit Committee Report


Two material weaknesses that have lingered for 18 months that formed no basis of the Audit Committee report? 
From Spruce Point’s perspective, it doesn’t appear to be a high priority for the Committee to resolve the issue.
86


Absurd Long-Term Performance Linked To 
Irrelevant Benchmark


Amcor has its principal office in Switzerland, is incorporated in Jersey, and has a majority of its revenues and assets 
in North America, Western Europe and Latin America. Yet, management wants to be paid on performance relative to a 
basket of ASX Australian companies, some of which little relation to Amcor’s business. Australian revenues and long-
term assets represent ~3% of Amcor’s legacy business. Amcor sells itself to investors as being a global company, so 


why not act like one and benchmark itself to a world index instead?

“Third, the transaction structure will result in the stock being listed on two major global exchanges, the NYSE and the ASX. 
And through these listings, we expect there will be greater liquidity for investors as the market capitalisation of the

the Australian listed shares will also continue to be included in the ASX 200 index.”

Biggest Buyer Is Amcor Itself


Amcor initially targeted potential buybacks of $200-$300m, increased the range to $300-$400m, then announced a 
$500m buyback. With the benefit of added proceeds from divestitures, Amcor could have boosted capital spending, 
R&D, or prioritized debt reduction to solidify its investment grade rating.  Instead, Amcor announced a $500m share 


repurchase program, and executed it at above-market price of $10.16 per share.(1)


1) Per the recent 10-Q: “During the six months ended December 31, 2019, the Company repurchased approximately $222.6 million, including transaction costs, or 21.9 million shares”

Historical Valuation


Amcor trades in excess of its long-term forward EV/EBITDA and in-line with its forward EV/Sales multiple. In the 
context of evidence that both Amcor and Bemis are experiencing declining revenues, we believe Amcor should trade at 


a multiple below its long-term average.

Amcor Valuation Rich In Context of Its 
Financial Challenges


Amcor screens as if its valuation is reasonable for a global paper and packaging company. In addition, its sales and 
earnings are temporarily showing growth from the addition of Bemis, but as we’ve illustrated, there is underlying 
revenue deterioration. Investors might think they are being compensated with a generous dividend yield as well. 


However, its valuation is predicated on overly aggressive revenue and earnings growth expectations. We’ve presented 
strong evidence why we believe sales will decline, margins disappoint, and the dividend potentially cut or eliminated.

Paper And Packaging Industry Case Study: 
WestRock Acquires KapStone


Similar to Amcor’s merger with Bemis, WestRock acquired KapStone in January 2018 in a $5 billion dollar deal. Since 
announcing the acquisition, shares have fallen over [50%] from continued revenue misses vs. analysts’ estimates. Bears 


argue WestRock’s cost synergy targets of $200m are optimistic. We believe Amcor’s merger with Bemis shows many 
similarities with Westrock’s acquisition of KapStone, and have reason to believe Amcor will face a similar demise.

KapStone Underperforming Since Acquisition


According to WestRock’s financial statements, legacy KapStone has significantly underperformed expectations since 
the acquisition. WestRock stated achieving anticipated growth opportunities as one determinant for the success of the 


deal. However, it appears legacy KapStone’s growth is declining.

We have provided evidence that both Amcor and Bemis 
have declining organic revenues of 3%-4% being masked 
by poor disclosures, recent asset sales, and mixing two 


companies with different time period reporting 
standards. Westrock, as another paper/packaging 


company struggling with a big acquisition, is currently 
projected to have declining sales and its sales multiple is 


1.0x. Other peers (Sonoco, Huhtamaki, Berry Plastics) 
also trade around 1.2x sales at the high end. We believe 


this is a reasonable multiple range for Amcor.

Amcor’s Adjusted EPS and EBITDA include numerous 
add-backs, some of which we have difficulty verifying 


through conflicting disclosures (eg. deal costs). 
We believe the Company’s free cash flow is the best way 
to view its performance, and we’ve illustrated that it is 


under pressure. Amcor’s closest peers trade around 18x 
2020E free cash flow.


$ in millions, except per share amounts


Our rigorous forensic analysis suggests it may be outright impossible for Amcor to meet lofty analyst expectations, with 
revenues already vanishing, deal costs higher than planned, and critical maintenance and growth capital expenditures being 
delayed.  Amcor’s valuation is in-line with industry peers, but should trade at a discount to reflect our documented concerns 
about the accuracy of its financial statements, fragile financial condition and unsustainable dividend policy. Investors should 


look at Westrock as a case study for what Amcor’s multiple can contract to once its strain becomes evident.
