Mobileye: Just Follow the Money 
 


Citron Sets Short-Term Target of $25 and Long Term 
Target Below $10 





Citron Drops the  on Insider Selling  
 


Just 11 weeks ago, Citron Research published commentary on the overdone run-
up in Ambarella's stock, pointing out how far investor enthusiasm had detached 
from reality.  In the last six weeks, while the Nasdaq Composite shed 8.7%, 


Ambarella plunged 38.6%.   
 


What happened?  Yes, the market has experienced a sentiment-shift, but more 
importantly, after Ambarella reported quarterly results, Wall Street realized that 
“drone dreams” couldn’t support a fantasy valuation for a chip company that 
faces a competitive future. 
 


Citron has seen this scenario play out many times in its 14 years of publication.  


Nobody on Wall Street has a longer and more consistent track record of 
exposing stories where enormous risk of the investment premise is being ignored 
in the face of massive hype.  
 
Does anyone remember the big 3D-Printing insanity of 2013-2014? (DDD, XONE, 
VJET) 
 


The play book looks like this:  Wall Street finds a story that the public will feed on, 
the media fuels the story, and the analysts promote the story, while management 
gets rich selling freshly minted stock into the story. 
 


Lather, Rinse, Repeat ...  Introducing Mobileye (NASDAQ:MBLY)

Citron offers an unassailable thesis why Mobileye is on its way to $25 near term:  


Follow the Money. 
 


  What is Mobileye's Actual Business? 
Mobileye is a pioneer and a market leader in Advanced Driver Assistance Systems.  
For those of you unfamiliar with (ADAS) here's a Wikipedia primer to get you up 
to speed:  
 


 
The ADAS feature set  


 
Note that while Mobileye is a pioneer in ADAS, they did not invent nor have any 
broad proprietary claim over ADAS functionalities.  Mobileye has been a leader in 
supplying ADAS technology on a chip to the auto industry and deserves credit for 
being an early mover in the space.   And that is where the story should have 
ended. 
 


There is NOTHING in the past or present financials, business performance or 
realistic future prospects of Mobileye that would get it within miles of justifying 
its current $12 billion market cap. They do not own a bar-the-competition patent 
portfolio on ADAS, nor do they have locked-in decades-long supply commitments.  
There are no barriers to entry for competitors other than legitimate R&D, and 
they do not have superior technology.  They just got there first.

Citron Reports on Mobileye September 9, 2015 Page 3 of 13 





Investing in this company is a "Hail-Mary bet” on a blue-sky future that just does 
not exist.   This is not merely the opinion of Citron-- it is the actions of 
management who have spoken with their dollars -- loud and clear -- selling stock 
more aggressively than Citron has ever witnessed -- as documented in this report.  


 
Mobileye's Current Valuation is Unfathomable 
 


There is no arguing that compared to other semiconductor companies Mobileye's 
valuation is absurd.  Even if the most optimistic revenue scenarios possible are 
extended through 2017…it's still absurd: 
 


Company Price/Sales Ratio 
MBLY  66 
MBLY in 2017 18.6  


That's IF their stock maintains $51 a share ...  
and ... the Company achieves 2017 high-end revenue 
estimates of 50% - 60% YoY revenue growth. 


BRCM 3.57 


NVDA 2.20 


QCOM 3.67 


INTC 2.44 


MRVL 1.83 


CRUS 2.61 


XLNX 4.47 


MLNX 3.60 


AVGO 5.30 


NXPI 3.78 
 


Even a stock price of $25 cannot be justified without requiring investors to believe 
that Mobileye will face zero near term competition as management and analysts 
“spin” in the story.  Citron finds these claims to be ignorant, negligent, fraudulent, 
and oblivious to the facts. 
 


Competition Is Here and Now!! 
While working on the Mobileye story, Citron Research was beaten to the punch 
on some of the important points of the Mobileye story, when Suhail Capital 
published an in-depth piece on Seeking Alpha, here: 


http://seekingalpha.com/article/3445726-mobileye-a-very-compelling-short-thesis 



http://seekingalpha.com/article/3445726-mobileye-a-very-compelling-short-thesis
Citron Reports on Mobileye September 9, 2015 Page 4 of 13 





The Suhail research report documents in significant detail Mobileye's actual 
competitive landscape in ADAS.  For brevity, Citron summarize the ADAS 
strategies for the 5 largest Tier-1 auto suppliers.  Contrary to what the analyst 
community is spewing out, Mobileye is facing years of intensifying competition.   
 


Top 5 Tier 1  
ADAS Suppliers 


Comments and Links 


Bosch Over 2,000 engineers working on ADAS technologies  


Continental Continental acquires ASL Vision 
Continental acquires Elektrobit 


Continental OEM's new  ADAS to Toyota  
(camera plus LIDAR) 


Delphi Delphi acquires Ottomatika 
Delphi acquires stake in Quanergy 


Denso Formerly a Mobileye partner. 
Now shipping its own units.  


Toyota still affiliated, but will offer its ADAS line to all auto 
manufacturers in 2016. 


Autoliv Own monocular camera units shipping 2015 
Autoliv Acquires M/A COM 


Formerly partnered with Mobileye for ADAS. 


 
Ominously, their main competitors are their own customers. Four of the top five 
Tier-1 auto industry suppliers now ship camera systems that compete directly 
with Mobileye's product.  Particular concern to Mobileye should be Denso and 
Continental, which were formerly Mobileye customers -- they've now gone on to 
compete against Mobileye with their own units, most using competing technology 
approaches.    
 


Note: These are not just any competitors.  Mobileye's sales channel is 
utterly dependent upon Tier-1 suppliers.  They are Mobileye's gateway 
to selling to nearly all auto makers.  
 


We're not intending to repeat all the details documented by Suhail, Citron 
encourages serious investors to read it for yourself. But it is obvious that there is 
not just a single ADAS solution -- there are a half dozen or more viable 
technologies, including monocular camera / image analysis, stereo cameras 
(significantly different from a technology perspective), radar, LIDAR (lasers) and 
hybrid blends of multiple sensors, all of which are supporting competitive ADAS 
product suites.

Mobileye's technology advantage is in just one of these technologies:  monocular 
camera/image analysis, with some early steps to integrate radar.  Thus, there is a 
wide open field for multiple approaches to innovate ADAS and march it down the 
cost curve as specified by Moore's Law. 
 


Competition in this space is inevitable, and there's plenty of information out 
there, as reflected by Suhail, that the competitive landscape is crowding up right 
now.  We credit the Pacific Crest analyst for articulating this thought best in a May 
15 report: 
 





What is the near term financial result of this increased competition? 
 


Let's assume that every one of these deep-pocket competitors implements their 
systems slower than expected and fails to dent Mobileye's penetration into ADAS 
market for the next 2 years.  Mobileye's revenue growth rate would than be  
expand even further -- from 54% to 60% in 2017. 
 


The industry standard sales multiple for semi companies is 2.5x revenue, but 
Citron will be overly generous and afford Mobileye 5x revenue.  That scenario 
gives Mobileye a 2016 market cap of $2.0 billion … that pegs the stock at $13.73... 
or $12.10 if you want to use the fully diluted share count.   And this is on a fully 
optimistic scenario with the both auto manufactures and tier one suppliers having 
slower implementation.  Anyone who believes Mobileye can maintain 
"dominance", as in virtual monopoly, in the hotly competitive ADAS space beyond 
2018 is naïve to the workings of the auto industry.  


This is Why Mobileye cannot stay dominant past 
the next 2 years:  
The Future Costs Money  $$$$$$$$ 


“The auto supply chain structure may ultimately turn from being a positive to 
a negative for Mobileye.  We believe these supplier partners have ample time 
to invest in similar technologies to bridge technology gaps. Further, given that 
these systems are often being provided by suppliers with massive incumbent 
footprints in the vehicle, competitors could certainly become more price 
aggressive. Finally, OEMs do not like to sole-source, which could limit 
Mobileye’s pricing leverage.” 
      -- Pacific Crest Analyst Note: May 15, 2015
Citron Reports on Mobileye September 9, 2015 Page 6 of 13 








It is not a point of dispute that several major automobile companies, along with 
Mobileye's former Tier 1 partners are working on their own proprietary ADAS 
solutions that are direct competitors to Mobileye.  The only way Mobileye has a 
competitive future would be to continuously release more sophisticated 
technology than their competitors -- and at lower price points.  (Remember, 
most ADAS features are currently sold to consumers as options, not part of 
base-model cars.)   It is ludicrous to project that it can sustain "monopoly" 
margins.  No fabless semiconductor company ever has.   
 


You cannot cheat Research & Development -- this is not a social network,  it is 
science.  Mobileye's R&D budget is miniscule, and completely outclassed in the 
auto industry.  Think about this: 6 of the top 20 companies in the world in R&D 
investment are automotive companies, and another one being Google. There is 
no way that Mobileye can keep any technological edge more than the few year 
lead they enjoyed without spending the big money.  
 


And instead of trying, their actions are those of a management team that has 
already thrown their hands up in defeat. 
 


MBLY market valuation relative to R&D looks most ludicrous when compared 
against other semiconductor companies that either sell or are preparing to sell 
products with ADAS applicability. 
 


Mobileye R&D to E/V is 0.33%  - that is not even on the charts compared to 
the competition.  In the past 18 months, Mobileye has spent a total of only $56 
million on Research and Development.   Here's the 2014 R&D spend of a few 
selected fabless semi companies and other potential competitors in Mobileye's 
space:

How Did Mobileye Ever Get to this Absurd Valuation??   
 


Behind every bubble, there must be a willing analyst.  In this case we turn to the 
curious case of Morgan Stanley who has been the most aggressive defender of 
MBLY stock.  In November 2013, Morgan Stanley published a 109 page report on 
the future of "Autonomous Cars".  This report was written by the same team that 


now covers Mobileye.  In all 109 pages, there are merely two passing 
references to Mobileye, although it had been in business since 1999. 
Nowhere in the report does Morgan Stanley even consider Mobileye 
to be the future of the ADAS or autonomous vehicles. 
 


Fast-forward 9 months and Morgan Stanley underwrites Mobileye's IPO plus its 
secondary.  Magically, with only $40 million spent on R&D since IPO, Morgan 
Stanley has anointed Mobileye as The Dominant Player in ADAS -- now and as far 
as the eye can see:  no competitive threats on the horizon for years….discounted 
cash flow models to 2029 ... complete nonsense and in complete contradiction to 
their own blue paper.

This is an eerily similar moment to one year ago this week: Morgan Stanley put a 
$135 price target on 3D-Printing company Stratysys.  One year later the stock is 
down 75% at $29.

Isn’t Mobileye on the forefront of a Self Driving Car?? 
 


It is Citron's opinion that much of the run in Mobileye's stock is due to the hype 
surrounding (autonomously) self-driving cars. Similar to when 3D-Printing stocks 
were peaking, the autonomous car is at the top of the hype cycle.

Citron Research will refrain from lengthy arguments about the realistic chances of 
mass market autonomous drive vehicles in the next decade or two.  It is an 
overanalyzed topic that garners far too much press already.   
 


But, we will say one thing:  The notion that Mobileye has a future in autonomous 
vehicles because they were a pioneer in ADAS systems is completely ridiculous.  
 


Here's how Mobileye describes / promotes itself in its own investment 
prospectus, explicitly suggesting its current niche business is a stepping stone to 
"a Life-Changing Megatrend" : 
 


 
 
 
 
 
The self-driving car is one of the most complex technology challenges of our age.  
If it ever becomes practical, it will inevitably include cameras and sensors like we 
see in advanced ADAS implementations, but will depend on breakthroughs in 
numerous complex technology disciplines, including high-throughput GPU 
computing, intensely detailed mapping technologies that will make today's
Citron Reports on Mobileye September 9, 2015 Page 10 of 13 





Google Maps look like the "model T", machine learning/AI, and failsafe network 
connectivity at levels far beyond our current mobile phones and computers.  It 
goes without saying that lives would be hanging in the balance of all these 
technologies playing together seamlessly.  
 


Needless to say, safety regulators, national and state legislators, and the 
insurance industry would all have to sign off before any of this technology goes 
mainstream...even if it ever proves its technological potential.  
 


While Mobileye's database of monocular camera processing is nice to have today, 
management is using it to hype a false promise that they can lead in self-driving 
car technology.  They know this is false, their true intentions are tipped by simply 
following the money.    
 


With their total R&D budget of $40 million a year compared to the dominant 
spend throughout the rest of the industry, Mobileye is bringing a slingshot to a 
gun fight. For those of you who live in a cave, here are a few small players who 
are now aggressively putting serious R&D funding into autonomous vehicles:  
Apple, Google, Toyota, Uber, Daimler, and now Toyota, through MIT and 
Stanford….. in addition to all the Tier 1 players identified above.   
 


Which companies will win?  Which technologies will win?  Does anyone win?  
None of that makes a difference to Mobileye, who is just an outsider looking in at 


the autonomous vehicle space.  If you don’t spend dollars -- you can’t 
make sense.

   Insider Selling Dumping Thrashing  
 


We are well aware that insider selling is a normal part of the IPO business. Yet 
what we have seen at Mobileye is something we have never witnessed. It all 
started with the IPO and continued in the secondary. 
 


This pair of massive stock offerings netted over 1.6 Billion for selling 
shareholders, while raising only 200 Million for the company.  This leaves Citron 
speechless.

Let Citron drop a few bombs on you:

 $1.6 Billion of insider cash-out is 13.7x the total R&D spend by Mobileye 
from 2011 to current 


 The average insider sale price is $33.14, which is a hefty 37% discount  to 
MBLY's current share price

   Mobileye's Chart of Doom: ALL YOU 


HAVE TO KNOW 


Insider Share Sale Proceeds as a % of Gross Revenues 


(Since Inception) 
 


Mobileye 396% 
GoPro 39% 


Twitter 15% 


Ambarella 10% 


Tesla 4% 


Netflix 1% 


 
Insiders and early stage investors have sold more in stock than the 
company has generated in gross revenues, plus every dollar of their 
lifetime R&D spend! 
 


Money talks ... and Mobileye insiders are fluent! 
 


Apologies to Tesla and Elon Musk 


Adding to the hype factor fluffing Mobileye is the fact that they are a direct 
supplier to Tesla.  Not wishing to insult readers' intelligence with a rant about the 
tiny unit sales represented by Tesla as a customer, Citron has previously offered 
opinions that Tesla is an overvalued stock.   


We must at least acknowledge Mr. Musk, who has personally participated in both 
Tesla's secondary offerings, and not helped himself to every opportunity to sell 
stock to the unsuspecting public.  His restraint stands in stark contrast to the 
excesses of Mobileye's management and insiders.
Citron Reports on Mobileye September 9, 2015 Page 13 of 13 





  Late breaking news!   
Citron is so excited!  Zvi Aviram was just now on CNBC hyping ... Self-Driving Cars!  
Watching the fluff piece, we were stunned that he didn't even bring along 
Mobileye's  own video simulation.  CNBC ran video clips of Mercedes and Google 


prototypes!  Neither company is even a customer of Mobileye. 
 


Meanwhile, Aviram has sold 5.59 million shares of Mobileye, nearly 
30% of his stake, at the IPO and secondary.   
 


He's personally pocketed appx $220 million, which is 2x the entire 
R&D spend of Mobileye since 2011 -- as far back as the company 
discloses.  


 
 Conclusion 





The story here is not complicated; it is a simple trail of "follow the money".  
Mobileye created early ADAS systems and has enjoyed success.  As soon as they 
began to earn broad market traction, the company went public (Goldman Sachs 
got 18% of the deal for $100 million and is now a seller.) They sold as many shares 
on the market as they could, and then raced right back to the well as soon as the 
lockup expired with a secondary to sell even more shares -- not to build an R&D 
war chest, but so company founders and early stage investors could run to the 
bank ... again.  (Not one dollar of the secondary went to the company.)  
 


In stark relief, while insiders and early investors pocketed over $1.6 billion in stock 
sales, all these geniuses raised a mere $200 million for the company.  Hence, the 
company is funded with only pocket change to spend on Research & 
Development -- most of which will inevitably be allocated to defend its market 
share in ADAS.   
 


As for the self-driving car -- why fight a war you cannot win?   
 


As reality sets in Citron expects Mobileye to trade down to $25 in the short term 
and single digits within the next 24 months.  It is 2015's DDD.   
 


      Cautious Investing to All.
