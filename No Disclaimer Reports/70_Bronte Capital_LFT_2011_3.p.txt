Longtop and the remarkable capital efficiency of the
Chinese cloud
A note on the comments: the comments on this post are consistently of the view that (a) the company
did not build a cloud-based storage infrastructure, (b) they did not build a petabyte data storage
solution for anyone, but (c) they assisted a customer build a large data set (probably not a petabyte)
and (d) otherwise the press release is a marketing puff-piece but not material to the stock.  They think
I have made too much of a marketing puff-piece. 
 
 
I agree that it is entirely possible that the press release is a marketing puff piece of marginal
importance to the stock.  It certainly has all the buzz-words.  Please do not read this post without
reading the comments which are - in my view - sophisticated and probably contain some truth. At
least they made me think. 
 
 
Some people who I trust think this could be done within the $1.5 million of incremental capital
spent this year.  I am not going to dispute that point - but whatever - it would use most of the
$1.5 million of incremental capital... and that leaves the question how did they manage to to
fund the rest of their growth. 
 
 
The core issue remains - how is it possible that this company has grown equipment and fitting so
slowly and revenue so fast? Unless there is a miracle they can't be doing it by owning cloud facilities.
The company has grown revenue by almost 50 percent in the last nine months adding almost no fixed
assets. 
 
 
So I remain puzzled. 
 
 
Now read the post - here without alteration: 
 
 
---------------------------- 
 
A while back I did a lot of work on cloud computing companies. This was not because I wanted to buy
the cloud companies (by and large I do not) but because I wanted to understand what they did to the
existing tech giants (such as Microsoft, Google, Apple, Hewlett Packard, Dell etc). You can find those
posts here, here, here and here. 
 
This stuff is important to us. Despite the (recent) content of this blog Bronte Capital's funds are
primarily long equities. We short on the side. Recently shorts have been abnormally profitable. Long
term returns will be driven by well-chosen value stocks. 
 
We have big positions in selected tech giants - and we need to understand the threats to those
businesses. So we went on a self-directed course in "cloud studies". [That course involved putting our
own server and storage in the cloud...] 
 
But you never know where your research will lead. "Cloud studies" took us to a remarkable press
release from Longtop Financial - what appears as a reputable Chinese IPO (not a reverse takeover)
with a reputable CFO. The remarkable press release described Longtop's efforts in being a cloud
provider - and more particularly a cloud-storage provider. 


Longtop Financial Technologies Limited (NYSE:LFT), a leading software developer and
solutions provider targeting the financial services industry in China, today announced
the official launch of its new data archiving solution.

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Longtop and the remarkable capital efficiency of the Chinese cloud


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/05/longtop-and-remarkable-capital.html 2/11


Like many organizations worldwide, financial institutions in China are experiencing
explosive data growth. They are facing big challenges in continuing to store and
manage the high-volume data for compliance purposes in a cost-effective way, as well
as query and retrieve them efficiently for business needs. Longtop's data achieving
solution has the capability to manage petabyte (PB) level structured data at both low
cost and high access efficiency. The solution has the advanced data storage and
management infrastructure built on cloud storage techniques, which has unlimited
horizontal scalability in both storage volume and access efficiency with a high
compression ratio. As a result, it can overcome the inherent deficiencies of traditional
Relational Database Management System products in high-volume data management
and help customers to build the new generation of data centers. 


"Much of the strength behind Longtop's solid organic growth track record comes from
our proprietary product development. Over the years, we have consistently focused on
Research and Development (R&D) and going forward we will continue to invest in
human resources and technology to help further strengthen our R&D capabilities,"
commented Weizhou Lian, Longtop's Chief Executive Officer. "I am very pleased that
one of the largest banks in China has been our first customer to deploy our data
archiving solution."


 
What struck me as peculiar about this release is that being a cloud computing company is very capital
intensive and I was wondering where they purchased their storage equipment from. After all storage
equipment for the cloud is a hugely market-sensitive business (that was what the 3Par spat between
Dell and HP was about see here and here). 
 
More generally cloud computing is capital intensive. The cloud companies see themselves as
utilities and have similar capital needs and economics. The main knock on the cloud computing
businesses - as per this otherwise laudatory article about Rackspace - is that they are hugely capital
intensive: 


But analysts have questioned the capital-intensive nature of Rackspace's business
model, especially because the company's capital-expenditure guidance will likely be
higher than its revenue trajectory for 2011. 


"Our business will always be relatively capital intensive," he [Lanham Napier] said,
largely because the company regularly has to upgrade its infrastructure. "The magic is
in the margin of service layer we add on top of that infrastructure. We're making
investments to continue to make the business more capital efficient, but we have more
work to do on it."


And of all the cloud functions the one that is most capital intensive appears to be storage. You see
when I am not using Bronte's server someone else can use the spare capacity. However when I am
not accessing Bronte's storage nobody else can use it. Storage is not shared and thus likely to
provide less capital advantage by going to "the cloud". And that shows in pricing - as Felix Salmon
has noted cloud storage is too expensive for much personal use. 
 
And yet Longtop have done cloud storage at the petabyte level (ie akin to Rackspace or Amazon)
without very much capital expenditure. At the beginning of the 2010-11 financial year Longtop had
fixed assets of $26.3 million. Nine months later - the nine months in which they launched their cloud
storage offering - the fixed assets had risen to $27.9 million. Revenue grew in that nine months by
over 40 percent (these numbers are in my previous post). 
 
They managed to launch a cloud storage service at the petabyte level with almost no capital
expenditure. 
 
I was puzzled. 
 
But the above mentioned remarkable press release told us that this amazing ability to do storage at
the petabyte level with enough backup for a large financial institution came from their skills in human
resource management. To quote again: 


Much of the strength behind Longtop's solid organic growth track record comes from
our proprietary product development. Over the years, we have consistently focused on
Research and Development (R&D) and going forward we will continue to invest in
human resources and technology to help further strengthen our R&D capabilities..."


These are remarkable skills. You see if Longtop can do this with only human resources (no
substantial capital expenditure) then the $300 million odd of capex expected at Rackspace this year is
wasted. There is probably half a billion of capex at Amazon EC2. That is wasted too. 
 
Moreover because cloud storage can be done without buying capital equipment the huge bidding war

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Longtop and the remarkable capital efficiency of the Chinese cloud

between Hewlett Packard and Dell over 3Par (a company that sells capital equipment for cloud
storage) was wasted and HP wasted billions of dollars. 
 
It is all possible of course. Longtop are about to displace Amazon, Dell, HP, Rackspace and a score of
other tech giants. 
 
These Chinese companies really are that remarkable. 
 
Just read the press release.
