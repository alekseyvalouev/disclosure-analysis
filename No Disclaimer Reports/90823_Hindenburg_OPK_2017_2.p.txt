Summary: OPKO Health, Inc. (OPK)
Opko’s stock is now halted following SEC charges alleging fraud by both the company and


its Chairman & CEO Phil Frost.


The company put out a rather impotent statement Friday evening claiming the SEC


complaint “contains serious factual inaccuracies” without identifying a single factual


inaccuracy.


We anticipate that criminal charges could follow given the reported FBI investigation that


parallels the SEC charges.


Frost is Opko’s key leader, key lender, and its largest holder with over 30% of the equity,


leaving the company in a perilous position.


Opko’s business was already in tatters. It is bleeding cash, has negative tangible equity,


and a weak pipeline. We do not see a bottom for this stock. Price target zero.

Opko Health: If These SEC Charges Were
Surprising Then You Haven’t Been Paying
Attention


Published on September 11, 2018



https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Ten months ago we wrote that Opko Health (NADSAQ:OPK


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/OPK)) was a “House of Cards Tumbling in the Dark


(https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-a-house-of-cards-tumbling-in-the-dark/)“. On


Friday afternoon the SEC �led litigation against Opko’s Chairman & CEO Phil Frost, Opko Health


Inc., and multiple other related entities and individuals. The complaint’s blistering allegations


accuse Frost and Opko of aiding and abetting multiple pump & dump schemes led by notorious


penny stock �nancier Barry Honig.


Frost stands personally accused of violating 7 sections of the Exchange and Securities Acts. Per


the SEC complaint: (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/complaints/2018/comp24262.pdf)


“In every scheme, Honig, and some combination of Stetson, Brauser, O’Rourke,


Groussman and Frost, either explicitly or tacitly agreed to buy, hold or sell their


shares in coordination with one another, knowing that a pump and dump was in the


o�ng that would allow them all to pro�t handsomely.”


Following the SEC complaint, Opko’s stock plummeted 18% before being halted.


Several signs point to the strong possibility that criminal charges could follow. The complaint


referenced “Company A” which has been identi�ed by the WSJ


(https://www.wsj.com/articles/ex-teva-chairman-blockchain-investor-accused-of-pump-and-


dump-scheme-1536351719) and others (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/prominent-


health-care-investor-phillip-frost-charged-by-sec-with-pump-and-dump-schemes-2018-09-07)


as Biozone Pharmaceuticals (now called Cocrystal, NASDAQ:COCP)


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COCP). In early 2017 investigative reporter Teri Buhl wrote


that the FBI and the California Department of Justice (DoJ) had been involved in the


investigation of Biozone. Per the article (http://www.teribuhl.com/2017/02/09/california-doj-


investigating-honig-and-the-frost-group-2/):


This reporter has seen a letter from the FBI that states this person is a potential victim


of securities fraud. A check-in the FBI’s victim noti�cation system, seen by this reporter


at press time, show the investigation is still active but doesn’t list speci�cally who the


investigation is about. Biozone is the only company the person interviewed by the FBI


held stock in.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Note that the SEC is a civil agency, whereas the FBI/DoJ is focused on criminal matters. If a civil


matter is referred for criminal prosecution (or if the FBI/DoJ requests the SEC’s expertise on


securities matters) then the two will often work together. The apparent coordination between


the DoJ and the SEC indicates that parallel criminal charges could follow these SEC civil charges.


Filed criminal charges are very serious and need to be dealt with correctly with all the force of


the legal system. If someone is facing these type of charges they will need to look at criminal


lawyers in their areas, such as the criminal lawyers in DuPage County


(https://www.wolfeandstec.com/criminal-law), or ones that are more local to them.


Indications show that both civil and criminal agencies are continuing to build its case, which


further indicates that more news could follow. The SEC’s litigation release


(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/2018/lr24262.htm) on Friday stated that there is a


“continuing investigation”. Days ago, Buhl wrote on twitter


(https://twitter.com/buhlreports/status/1038145448341643264):


“…based on multiple sources the FBI has recently been interviewing new informants in


this case.”


Lastly, the SEC will often provide notice of its intent to sue and seek to negotiate a settlement


with parties in advance. Based on Opko’s statement on Friday evening


(http://investor.opko.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opko-comments-sec-complaint)


it appears the SEC had not a�orded Frost & Opko the opportunity to settle. Per the statement,


“the SEC failed to provide notice of its intent to sue prior to �ling the complaint.” The lack of any


such discussion could indicate that another shoe is poised to drop.


These SEC Charges Should Not Be a Surprise to
Anyone


Barry Honig has become widely recognized of late as a �nancier with a questionable


reputation. We have written extensively about Honig’s crucial role in several dubious


enterprises, including Riot Blockchain (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4131031-riot-


blockchain-sudden-business-pivot-suspicious-acquisitions-questionable-special-dividend) (RIOT


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/RIOT)), and Pershing Gold

daisy-chain) his relationships with PolarityTe (COOL (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/COOL)),


Marathon Patent Group (MARA (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/MARA)), and numerous


others.


Those who have followed Honig’s career trajectory have seen that Phil Frost has been an


integral part of the equation. Not only has Frost provided capital to Honig’s deals, but he has


also mortgaged his reputation as a successful billionaire biotech investors as a means of


providing credibility to his microcap stocks. (See examples here


(https://www.thestreet.com/story/12064490/1/biozone-a-little-biotech-setting-up-for-big-


gains.html), here (http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/mabvax-therapeutics-catches-


eye-billionaire-investor-dr-phillip-frost-opko-health-otcqb-mbvx-2007614.htm), and here


(https://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/01/03/the-bu�ett-of-biotechs-


portfolio/#1bc3f43a4a34).)


The Frost/Honig relationship is not new. Back in 2014, Bill Alpert of Barron’s reported on the


numerous penny stock deals that Frost had participated in alongside Barry Honig and Michael


Brauser, who are now all co-defendants in the SEC complaint. Per the article


(https://www.barrons.com/articles/why-etfs-beat-money-managers-1417235993):


Over the past few years, these two South Florida gents (Honig and Brauser) have


invested alongside Frost in a couple of dozen micro-cap companies. Scanning the list


of those companies last week, I calculated that their average market cap was about


$75 million. The middle of the pack (in other words, the median company) had a


valuation of under $30 million.


The closeness of the relationship was apparent even then:


While Honig works out of Boca Raton, Brauser has his business in the same Biscayne


Boulevard address in Miami as Opko Health and Frost’s own investment operation.


Beyond lending his reputation to this bevy of penny stock companies, Frost’s a�liated


investment bank often rears its head in these deals. Investment bank Ladenburg Thalmann


(LTS (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LTS)) – which counts Frost as its Chairman


(https://www.ladenburg.com/about-us/leadership/board-of-directors/member/14052/phillip-


frost-m-d) and largest holder with ~33% of its equity – regularly provides “Buy” ratings and


favorable research to Frost/Honig a�liated companies.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
A glance at Ladenburg’s current research coverage (https://www.ladenburg.com/investment-


banking/equity-research/research-universe) shows that Frost/Honig a�liated companies


Chromadex (CDXC (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CDXC)), VBI Vaccines (VBIV


(https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/VBIV)), IZEA (IZEA (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/IZEA)),


Neovasc (NVCN (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NVCN)), and Opko Health are all covered by


the investment bank. Every single one has been issued a “Buy” rating.


So far, the most common reaction we have seen to these charges is “why”? Why would a


billionaire who has built genuine biotech businesses tinker around with $5 to $10 million


scores in shady penny stock deals?


Maybe he likes it? Maybe he’s good at it? Maybe he’s not as wealthy as people assume? (The


Frost Science Museum in Miami, named after Phil Frost, required a $49 million bailout


(https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/community/miami-dade/article70060167.html) in


2016.)


In the end we don’t really know. Why does any really smart person do anything really stupid? At


a certain point it doesn’t matter. The signs were all there and the trial evidence will speak for


itself.


Opko’s BioReference Division, With Its Well-
Documented Connections to Bucket Shop Brokers
and Organized Crime Could Have Also Served As a
Warning


In addition to Frost’s longstanding a�liation with the Honig syndicate, the internal operations


at Opko should have also sounded alarm bells for investors. In our piece back in November


(https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-a-house-of-cards-tumbling-in-the-dark/) we


detailed the extensively checkered regulatory and legal history of executives in BioReference


Labs, Opko’s key diagnostics division. As Barron’s had reported in 2011

Was �nanced in the decade after its 1986 initial public o�ering by such penny-stock


bankers as Paul Russo, a Ma�a-associated broker, and J.T. Moran, whose �rm was the


model for the movie Boiler Room. They and other Bio-Reference backers ended up in


jail (“There Will Be Blood


(http://online.barrons.com/articles/SB50001424052970203869804576327653050457


990),” May 23, 2011). Grodman and Bio-Reference were never implicated in any


untoward activities, and he has said he never saw any wrongdoing.


At one point Grodman’s brother Joel was alleged


(https://www.villagevoice.com/2003/03/18/gottis-golden-goose/) to have posed as a salesman


for BioReference in order to secure a mob-controlled union contract with $400,000 of kickbacks


to mob boss Peter Gotti. Joel Grodman cooperated with prosecutors and escaped charges in


the matter.


Marc Grodman served as CEO of BioReference from its founding and through its acquisition


(https://www.barrons.com/articles/opko-health-buys-bio-reference-for-1-47b-deal-gets-cold-


reception-1433429400) by Opko until 2016


(https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160315005608/en/OPKO-Health-Names-Dr.-


Gregory-Henderson-President), with Phil Frost’s blessing.


BioReference’s longstanding Chief Information O�cer had a past criminal conviction


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/richard-faherty-criminal-sanction-details)


and was disbarred (https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/richard-faherty-


disbarrment/HindenburgResearch/richard-faherty-disbarrment) as an attorney. He served in


his role at BioReference until mid 2017, with Phil Frost’s blessing.


The fact that Frost was comfortable with the BioReference acquisition in the �rst place (despite


its odious reputation) should have been a loud warning.


Opko’s Pre-Existing Regulatory Overhang


Note that Opko had looming regulatory liabilities even prior to the recent SEC charges. Since


May of 2017 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480917000005/opk-


3312017x10q.htm) Opko has repeatedly disclosed a False Claims Act (FCA

https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCA

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In April 2017, the Civil Division of the United States Attorney’s O�ce for the Southern


District of New York (the “SDNY”) informed BioReference that it believes that, from


2006 to the present, BioReference had, in violation of the False Claims Act, improperly


billed Medicare and TRICARE (both are federal government healthcare programs) for


clinical laboratory services provided to hospital inpatient bene�ciaries at certain


hospitals.


The FCA probe is already in seemingly advanced stages. Now the SEC charges add another


major liability to the pile.


Opko’s Finances and Future Pipeline Prospects
Were Already Abysmal


We didn’t think the company could handle any additional liabilities in the �rst place. Opko’s


new regulatory issues are merely another weight tied to an already sinking ship.


The company’s balance sheet is in an incredibly fragile state. As of the latest quarter


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480918000035/opk-


6302018x10q.htm), tangible equity was negative $198 million.


The business operations have provided no support. Opko recorded negative$65 million in free


cash �ow in the past 6 months and has consistently recorded negative free cash �ow in the


past several years.


Opko’s lone FDA-approved product, Rayaldee, has been a dud for reasons we have extensively


documented (https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-a-house-of-cards-tumbling-in-the-


dark/). The drug launched (http://investor.opko.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opko-


announces-us-launch-rayaldeetm) almost 2 years ago and has yet to generate positive cash


�ow (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196141-opko-health-inc-opk-ceo-phillip-frost-q2-2018-


results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single).


Opko’s lone licensed FDA-approved drug, Varubi, recently had its intravenous formulation


discontinued due to severe side e�ects (https://www.oncologynurseadvisor.com/side-e�ect-


management/fda-issues-warning-for-rolapitant-injectable-emulsion/article/737647/).

Intravenous treatments account for about 90% of the drug’s market,


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4122661-opko-healths-opk-ceo-phillip-frost-q3-2017-results-


earnings-call-transcript?part=single) according to Opko.


Opko’s much touted 4KScore test for prostate cancer has also been a dud for reasons we have


extensively documented (https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-a-house-of-cards-


tumbling-in-the-dark/). The test’s utilization increased a mere 10% y/y as of last quarter


(http://investor.opko.com/news-releases/news-release-details/opko-health-reports-second-


quarter-2018-�nancial-results), coming o� of a low base, despite broad e�orts to advertise the


test and despite vast e�orts to seek reimbursement support. Per Opko’s latest 10-Q:


We do not anticipate that we will generate substantial revenue from the sale of


proprietary pharmaceutical products or certain of our diagnostic products for some


time and we have generated only limited revenue from…sale of the 4Kscore test. (Pg.


31 (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/944809/000094480918000035/opk-


6302018x10q.htm))


Opko recently received a setback on its key pipeline drug as well. The FDA provided feedback


on Opko’s hGh candidate drug saying that they would need to perform a year-long


bioequivalence study (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196141-opko-health-inc-opk-ceo-


phillip-frost-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single), pushing any catalyst timeline


until the end of 2019 at the earliest.


Opko’s key device o�ering, the Claros, has similarly stalled. We had previously extensively


documented (https://hindenburgresearch.com/opko-health-a-house-of-cards-tumbling-in-the-


dark/) why we thought Opko’s Claros device never had any chance of achieving FDA approval.


Opko indirectly acknowledged the setback on the Q2 conference call


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4196141-opko-health-inc-opk-ceo-phillip-frost-q2-2018-


results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single):


“(the FDA) asked for some other studies. We �led our �rst amendment with them and


we’re now in the process of gathering the second amendment information from the


�eld.”


We don’t see there being much left to look forward to in the way of pipeline assets.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Despite all of the above, the one thing supporting Opko’s stock, in our opinion, was Phil Frost.


His insider purchases, his emergency loans (http://investor.opko.com/news-releases/news-


release-details/opko-health-reports-2017-fourth-quarter-business-highlights-and), and his


reputation as the billionaire “Warren Bu�ett of Biotech


(https://www.forbes.com/sites/schifrin/2017/01/03/the-bu�ett-of-biotechs-


portfolio/#680a16ec3a4a)” had buoyed the company despite its cascade of repeated �nancial


and product failures.


Now that Frost has been charged with securities fraud we think that has all changed. We do not


see a bottom for Opko.


What is Next For Opko A�er It Resumes Trading?


The SEC complaint is likely to have broad-reaching implications for Opko. On the �nancing side


it will hamper Opko’s relationships with creditors and will limit other capital raising options.


Internally, it is likely to diminish morale and talent retention. (When the CEO and the company


get hit for fraud people tend to brush up on their resumes.)


Notably, while the SEC is seeking to bar other defendants in the complaint from serving as


o�cers or directors of publicly traded companies, Frost was not included on that list. This


suggests that (for better or worse) he would still be permitted to run Opko or another public


company regardless of the outcome of the SEC case.


All told, the uncertainty resulting from the SEC complaint is another nail in the co�n of what


was otherwise a struggling, poorly capitalized, fundamentally unsound business with pre-


existing regulatory overhang. We think Opko is on the fast-track to the dustbin. Price target


zero.


Best of luck to all.
