Lentuo International (LAS)
– Related Party’s
Undisclosed RMB 250
Million Debt Issuance
Raises Red Flag
May 28, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary


Best-case scenario: Lentuo International (LAS) failed
to disclose that a related PRC entity controlled by its
Chairman incurred RMB 250 million in debt is secured
by the Chairman’s assets, including his ownership
interest in LAS, and the revenues of LAS.
Worst-case scenario: LAS failed to include the related
PRC entity’s RMB 250 million debt in LAS’s
consolidated financial statements for the period ended
December 31, 2013.
The undisclosed debt may be funding the build-out of
car dealerships by the related PRC entity that could
directly compete with LAS.
LAS’s history of selective disclosures regarding its
dealings with the related PRC entity leads us to
believe that management intentionally omitted the
details and potential impact of the debt.


After experiencing a 33% share price decline since May 19,
2014, LAS Chairman Hetong Guo and CEO Jing Yang on
May 27, 2014 announced their intention to buy up to $1
million of LAS shares over the next year in the open
market. What Chairman Guo failed to tell investors is that
in 2013 he had secretly pledged his assets including his
existing ownership interest in LAS as collateral for

5/23/2018 Lentuo International (LAS) - Related Party’s Undisclosed RMB 250 Million Debt Issuance Raises Red Flag | GeoInvesting

undisclosed debt totaling RMB 250 million issued by a
related PRC entity under his control. Chairman Guo and
CEO Yang also failed to tell investors that the related
party’s debt was further secured by the revenues of LAS.


Background


LAS is a leading automobile retailer headquartered in
Beijing. LAS operates 12 franchise dealerships, 10
automobile showrooms, one automobile repair shop, and
one car leasing company. The dealerships operate under
the “4S” brand.


Based on our research, LAS appears to be joining a
growing list of ChinaHybrid companies that are not
properly disclosing all of their material Chinese business
dealings in their U.S. SEC filings. LAS is potentially facing a
similar scenario to that of FAB Universal (FU), which we
reported on November 18, 2013 had completed a $16.4
million bond offering in China that was not disclosed in its
SEC filings. Following our report, the NYSE halted trading
in FU shares and issued a delisting determination.


Our research uncovered evidence that Lentuo
Electromechanical, a related party entity that owns
LAS’s variable interest operating entities (“VIEs”) in
China, issued RMB 250 million ($41 million) of debt
in 2013 through two trusts made up of Chinese
investors. We confirmed our findings through phone
conversations with the management companies of
the two trusts. LAS appears to have neither disclosed
the debt nor its collateral in its 2013 20-F filed on
May 15, 2014.


A key to the severity of our findings
hinges on whether or not the debt
should be consolidated into LAS’s
financial statements.

5/23/2018 Lentuo International (LAS) - Related Party’s Undisclosed RMB 250 Million Debt Issuance Raises Red Flag | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 3/23


Worst Case Scenario


If one or both of the Lentuo Electromechanical trust loans
should have been consolidated and disclosed in LAS’s 2013
audited financial statements, then quite obviously:


LAS’s auditor, Ernst & Young Hua Ming LLP, must
reconsider its audit opinion on LAS; and
LAS shares could suffer a substantial decline and
trading halt while these matters are reviewed by
regulators


Best Case Scenario is Still Very Bad


The legal entitlement to most of the profits of LAS’s
Chinese operations is dictated by variable interest entity
(“VIE”) contractual arrangements and not through direct
ownership. U.S. investors put faith in LAS management,
entrusting them not to take actions that jeopardize LAS’s
claim to the Chinese operating companies’ cash flows.
Whether by intention or coincidence, LAS’s corporate
structure is unfortunately constructed such that
management only selectively discloses actions taken by
Lentuo Electromechanical, a related party that is the
holding company of LAS’s VIEs.


Therefore in the best-case scenario, what we have
uncovered is a very serious disclosure issue where
management has intentionally failed to disclose that Lentuo
Electromechanical raised funds in China collateralized by
Chairman Guo’s assets, including his ownership interest in
LAS, and the revenues of LAS.


Of further concern are indications that the funds raised by
Lentuo Electromechanical are potentially being used to
build car dealerships that could directly compete with LAS.


The Evidence

https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 4/23


Due to its complex corporate structure (detailed below), by
design LAS may only have to consolidate the Lentuo
Electromechanical trust loans if the funds were used by
LAS’s variable interest operating entities.


LAS’s corporate structure is diagrammed in its 20-F along
with an accompanying list of variable interest operating
entities, as follows:


(1) Affiliated Entity / Function


Beijing Tuozhan Industrial & Trading Development Co.,
Ltd. / FAW-Volkswagen dealerships
Beijing Aotong Automobile Trading Co., Ltd. / Audi
dealerships
Beijing Lentuo Chengxin Commercial & Trading Co.,
Ltd. / FAW-Mazda dealerships
Beijing Yuantongqiao Toyota Automobile Trading Co.,
Ltd. / Toyota dealerships
Beijing Tuojiacheng Commercial & Trading Co., Ltd. /
Chang An-Mazda dealership
Beijing Lentuo Huitong Automobile Sales Service Co.,
Ltd. / Shanghai-Volkswagen dealership
Beijing Lentuo Tongda Automobile Sales Service Co.,
Ltd. / FAW-Volkswagen dealerships
Beijing Tuozhan Automobile Repair Co., Ltd. /
Automobile repair shop
Beijing Lentuo Automobile Leasing Co., Ltd. /
Automobile leasing


From the chart and list we can see that Lentuo
Electromechanical is not one of LAS’s variable interest
operating entities, but only the parent company of LAS’s
VIEs that own the actual dealerships. Lentuo
Electromechanical, rather than LAS or its VIEs, was the
company that raised RMB 250 million from the two trusts.

https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 5/23


The key question is whether some portion of the RMB
250 million was deployed to build out LAS’s VIE
dealerships, requiring consolidation of that portion
of the debt in LAS’s financials. There is evidence that
this may have in fact been the case.


LAS requires capital to grow its 4S car dealership footprint
in China. Based on recent Chinese news, LAS’s related
company, Lentuo Electromechanical, raised RMB 250
million in debt to help finance this expansion initiative. The
first RMB 150 million was raised in China through a trust
fund managed by Gansu Trust in December 2013,
according to information obtained from the Chinese
website, Trust-trust.com, as follows:

https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 9/23


The RMB 150 million trust description contains the
following statement:


“Trust loan to Beijing Lentuo Electromechanical Group Co.,
Ltd., including Beijing Audi 4S Store construction”.


Page F-58 of the 20-F states:


“…


D) Capital commitment


As of December 31, 2013, the Group has
contracted but unpaid cost of RMB 25,000
(US$4,130) for the construction of a new Audi
store which is in progress.


…”


Page 26 of the 20-F states:


“We are also constructing a new Audi dealership
in Beijing.”


In Chairman Hetong Guo’s letter to shareholders dated May
22, 2014, he mentioned the new joint venture investment
from Itochu “…that will also help us complete our new Audi
4S dealership in Beijing, whose construction began in
November 2012.”


From the available information, it appears that either the
RMB 150 million trust loan is being used to build LAS’s new
Beijing Audi dealership (and therefore should have been
consolidated, at least in part, into LAS’s financials) or is
being used to fund a potentially competing Beijing Audi

We called the respective management companies of both
trusts (Gansu Trust and Inthedinghong Investment Co.,
Ltd.) and confirmed that both trusts were fully subscribed,
and that Lentuo Electromechanical had obtained the
proceeds from both trust loans by the end of 2013.


The Two Trust Loans do not appear to
be disclosed in LAS’s Financial
Statements


An analysis of the audited balance sheet footnotes
disclosed in the 2013 20-F indicates that LAS never
consolidated the trust loans. According to footnote 18 on
page F-42, short-term and long-term loans at December
31, 2013 consisted of the following:

5/23/2018 Lentuo International (LAS) - Related Party’s Undisclosed RMB 250 Million Debt Issuance Raises Red Flag | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 17/23


“The Group’s short-term loans were RMB-
denominated loans obtained from banks and
other financial institutions with interest rates
ranging from 4.83% to 10.25% per annum and
5.60% to 10.20% per annum for the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2013, respectively. The
weighted average interest rate on short-term
loans outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and
2013 was 7.91% and 7.53% per annum,
respectively. The short-term loans are repayable
between January 2014 and November 2014. The
unused lines of credit for short-term financing
amounted to RMB 356,421 and RMB 668,680
(US$110,458) as of December 31, 2012 and
December 31, 2013, respectively.”


Inspection of the maturity and interest rates of the short-
and long-term loans disclosed in the 20-F compared to the
terms of the two trust loans led us to conclude that the
250 million RMB trust loans were not consolidated into
LAS’s financials for the following reasons:


1. Loan Maturity


According to the available data, the trust loans pay
interest semiannually and mature in two years. The
non-current portion of LAS’s long-term loans disclosed
on its balance sheet is only RMB 33 million. Thus the
RMB 250 million trust loans maturing in two years do
not appear to be included in LAS’s long-term loans
disclosed on its balance sheet.
Furthermore, LAS discloses on p. F-42 that it only has
one long-term loan, obtained from Shanghai Pudong
Development Bank, totaling RMB 39 million that is
repayable over 5 years. This amount is allocated on

https://geoinvesting.com/lentuo-international-related-partys-undisclosed-rmb-250-million-debt-issuance-raises-red-flag/ 18/23


LAS’s balance sheet as RMB 6 million (long-term,
current portion) plus RMB 33 million (long-term, non-
current portion.)


2. Interest Rate Analysis:


The interest rates for LAS’s short-term loans range
from 4.83% to 10.25% per annum and 5.60% to
10.20% per annum for the years ended December 31,
2012 and 2013, respectively.
However, the interest rate range for two trusts is
10.5% to 12%, which is higher than the high end of
the interest rates mentioned by LAS under bank
borrowing.


Best Case Scenario Could Be Just as Bad
for Investors:


Even if the trust loans should not have been consolidated
into LAS’s financials, several very serious issues remain:


1. According to the trust loan descriptions, all the
revenue from LAS’s “4S” dealerships, LAS’s major
revenue, appears to be pledged as collateral for the
two trust loans. LAS never disclosed this in its SEC
filings.


2. LAS’s Chairman and largest shareholder, Hetong Guo,
provided unlimited several and joint liability personal
guarantees to the trusts. In the event of default,
Chinese investors in the trusts could sue Hetong Guo
and claim Guo’s LAS shares in court. LAS never
disclosed this risk factor in its SEC filings.


3. Even if the RMB 150 million trust loan is being used to
fund a Beijing Audi dealership owned by Lentuo
Electromechanical that will not be consolidated into
LAS’s financials, it presents new potential competition
to LAS’s Beijing Audi “4S” dealership.

4. The RMB 100 million trust loan is slated to be used to
construct two other “4S” dealerships (FAW-
Volkswagen Beijing Yayuncun and FAW-Volkswagen
Changchun) that if not consolidated into LAS’s
financials could add additional “competition” between
Lentuo Electromechanical and LAS. This risk is also
not disclosed in SEC filings. We don’t think it’s
farfetched to conclude that Lentuo Electromechanical
is building dealerships it intends to operate in
competition with LAS.


LAS Management is Clearly Aware of its
Disclosure Obligations


LAS does disclose numerous aspects of its relationship with
Lentuo Electromechanical leading to us question why
management chose to omit the details of the trust loans
and to conclude that the omission was no simple mistake.
Note the following detailed series of disclosures of loans
and guarantees by, for, and between Lentuo
Electromechanical and various LAS entities from the 20-F:


“…


In 2011, we engaged Lentuo
Electromechanical, a company controlled by
Mr. Hetong Guo, our founder, chairman and
largest shareholder, as our agent in pursuit
of an acquisition opportunity. In connection
with this engagement, we provided a
temporary funding in the amount of
approximately RMB 186.8 million to Lentuo
Electromechanical in anticipation of the
potential advance payment to the seller by
Lentuo Electromechanical on our behalf.
When this acquisition opportunity failed to
materialize, Lentuo Electromechanical
promptly repaid the whole amount to us. In

2011, we also received interest-free short-
term loans of approximately RMB 129.9
million from Lentuo Electromechanical in
support of our operations, which have been
repaid by us.


In 2012, we received interest-free short-
term loans of approximately RMB 47.4
million from Mr. Hetong Guo and Lentuo
Electromechanical in support of our
operations, which have been repaid by us.
Mr. Hetong Guo guaranteed certain of our
short-term loans that amounted to RMB
40.0 million as of December 31, 2012. Our
dealerships also guaranteed certain short-
term loans of their equity owner Lentuo
Electromechanical, as required by banks,
and the balance of such loans amounted to
RMB 200 million as of December 31, 2012.


In 2013, in anticipation of our business
expansion, we paid approximately RMB
302.8 million ($50.0 million) to acquire two
properties in Beijing from Lentuo
Electromechanical and Beijing Lentuo
Tongda Enterprise Management Co., Ltd.,
both controlled by Mr. Guo, respectively.


In 2013, we also made new vehicle sales of
approximately RMB 45.9 million ($7.6
million) to the minority equity holder of our
GAC-Honda dealership. Mr. Guo and Lentuo
Electromechanical guaranteed certain of our
short-term and long-term loans that
amounted to RMB 234.4 million ($38.7
million) as of December 31, 2013. Our
dealerships also continue to guarantee
certain short-term loans of Lentuo

Where are the guarantees for the two
trust loans in these detailed
disclosures?


Conclusion


There are several issues surrounding the two trusts loans
totaling RMB 250 million we have discussed in this report.
In a worst-case scenario, LAS has raised money in China
without properly disclosing this event to investors and
consolidating the debt into its financials. In a best-case
scenario it would seem that LAS’s Chairman pledged his
own stake in the U.S. listed company along with the rights
to all the revenues of LAS’s Chinese operating companies
to potentially fund direct private competition with the U.S.
listed company. We thus seriously doubt the accuracy of
LAS’s financial statements and disclosures reported in its
SEC filings. We urge LAS’s auditor, Ernst & Young Hua Ming
LLP, to reconsider its audit opinion of LAS, especially
regarding the consolidation and disclosures related to the
two RMB 250 million trust loans.
