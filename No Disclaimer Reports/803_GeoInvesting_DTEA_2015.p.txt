DAVIDsTEA – DTEA – Far
Too Optimistic in a Very
Crowded Space
November 25, 2015 By GeoTeam


We have initiated a
short position in
DAVIDsTEA Inc.
(NASDAQ:DTEA).
The company is a
Canadian specialty
tea and tea
accessory retailer
that is the largest
of its kind. It
competes directly
with Starbucks-


owned Teavana, which already has a stronghold on the
U.S. market and a seemingly endless supply of resources
and cash to do its business with, as its parent company is a
$92 billion juggernaut that is still in the midst of aggressive
expansion globally.


One of the value adds for our members is that not only do
we come up with ideas in-house, but we are constantly
looking for longer term ideas that can generate alpha
across the web and in collaboration with some of our
contributors and other research firms. We have found an
idea from a recent Seeking Alpha article that we believe
makes for a good common sense short, and we wanted to
share it with our members.

In this case, the stock has already fallen ~17% from the
time this article was released, but we believe it could have
up to 45% more downside.


Starbucks Corporation (NMS:SBUX) also owns Tazo Tea
Company, which is the other type of tea offered at its retail
locations. Starbucks bought Tazo in the 90’s and since
then, it has become the primary brand of tea sold in
Starbucks retail stores. These two brands make up the
majority of the competitive landscape in the U.S. for
David’s Tea. Starbucks has 23,132 retail locations
worldwide and Teavana has over 355.


We find DTEA trying to compete with Starbucks about as
fruitless as Overstock and Wayfair trying to compete with
Amazon – it just doesn’t make sense.


Why GeoInvesting is Short
DAVIDsTEA


Our elevator pitch on why we’re short is relatively simple:


1. DavidsTEA has set extremely lofty expectations for
itself and the first instance of the market getting a
look at the company’s numbers led to an immediate
25% haircut from the company’s IPO price.


2. The core of its stores, in Canada, have just started
posting declines in same store traffic, leading some
analysts to believe the move to the U.S. is a “rush for
growth”


3. The CEO of the company appears to have a peculiar
past that includes numerous scandals and
bankruptcies


4. The CEO has failed in previous attempts to expand
businesses into the U.S.


When we look at the company’s current valuation,
combined with the “common sense” arguments made

above, we continue to think there’s far more risk to the
downside. The company trades at about 18X estimates,
indicative of a company with a long runway of growth,
which we do not believe DTEA has in front of it.


Analyst estimates are for $0.64 next year, revised down
from the $0.65 to $0.69 range they were in for the last two
to three months.


The main caveat is that the company doesn’t seem to be
leveraged at all. With the balance sheet clean, there is
nothing preventing the company from raising cash through
debt in order to fund its expansion, buy back shares, or to
allocate elsewhere.


For more information, you can reference this in-depth
Seeking Alpha article, which is what originally piqued our
interest in the company.
