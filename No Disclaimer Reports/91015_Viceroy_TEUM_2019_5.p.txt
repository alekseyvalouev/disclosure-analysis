Pareteum  - The Hal Turner Options Appreciation Club 
Convenient amendments to stock vesting schemes 


July 17, 2019 – We ask investors today to consider what Viceroy believes is an excessive enrichment by 


Pareteum’s Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer’s share ownership and compensation: 


▪ Reflect a low level of confidence in the company given Hal’s immediate offering of 2,000,000 shares as part 


of the 2018 Long-Term Incentive Plan  


▪ Show the acquisition of Artilium helped Turner vest and sell shares in Pareteum at an accelerated rate, 


despite no clear reason for this vesting, save for a convenient amendment in the terms.

June 6, 2018 


On June 13, 2018 Pareteum filed and 8K regarding an amendment to Turner’s employment agreement.  


 
Figure 1 Pareteum 8K filed June 13, 20181 


Notably, this amendment would vest all restricted stock awards at the start of each calendar quarter and 


immediately vest all option shares in the event of a “Change of Control or Trigerring Event”. This amendment 


became effective on June 6, 2018, the day before a “Change of Control or Triggering Event” would occur. 


June 7, 2018 


Pareteum and Artilium announce acquisition agreement for USD104.7m which constitutes a “Change of 


Control or Triggering Event” in the amendment on June 6, 2018, the day prior, but which was only announced 


the following week.

Turner’s employment agreement was amended to immediately vest his options and speed 


up the vesting of restricted stock awards the day before an acquisition. No other 


employment agreements were amended in this way. 





October 10, 2018 


On October 10, 2018 Pareteum filed a Form S-8 effective the next day detailing the 2018 Long-Term Incentive 


Plan and an offering by Turner and Pareteum Director Yves Van Sante. Turner’s offering is the full 2,000,000 


shares offered under the 2018 plan.  


 
Figure 3 Pareteum Form S-8 filed October 10, 20183 


Turner’s holdings also include 1,500,000 shares from the 2017 plan which vested at the beginning of the calendar 


quarter due to Pareteum’s “Change of Control or Triggering Event” and Turner’s timely amended employment 


agreement.

October 25, 2018 


On October 25, 2018 Turner filed a Form-4 in which he acquired the 2,000,000 shares pursuant to the 2018 Long-


Term Incentive Plan. A review of Turner’s holdings show he had at some point sold 1,000,000 Pareteum shares 


in the 16 days since the Form S-8 referenced above. 


 
Figure 4 Robert Turner Form-4 filed October 26, 20184 


Based on the disclosure, it appears these shares were issued as part of the 2017 plan. 


Turner’s windfall from Pareteum’s acquisition of Artilium seems a good a time as any to take a look at the 


company in more detail. In the calculations in our original report we made the assumption that these businesses 


operated on the same 30-day billing and payment cycle as Pareteum5. 


2. Artilium 


The announcement of Pareteum’s acquisition of Artilium for USD104.7m was made on June 7, 2018.  


At the time of its acquisition Artilium was structured as four main trading businesses6: 


1. Artilium NV, whose core product is the ARTA platform which allows network operators to open 


networks to third party developers. 


2. United Telecom NV, a provider/reseller of telecommunications services in Belgium and the 


Netherlands. 


3. Artilium BV, operates under the trade names of Comsys and Livecom. Comsys provides interactive 


telephony services, multi-channel call center solutions and other communications services. 


4. Interactive Digital Media, an international cloud communications provider acquired in January 2018 


focused on enterprise messaging and communications. 


None of these segments generated positive profit, or EBIT since 2014 when Artilium NV and United Telecom 


were the only segments. Artilium reported an EUR268,000 profit that year.

5 This assumption was made to gauge the collectability of revenues from Pareteum core customers.

Figure 5 Artilium 2018 Segment Reporting 


Artilium also exhibits the same issues as Pareteum regarding a growing receivable balance suggestive of difficulty 


collecting on its revenues. As of mid-2018, Artilium had 77 days receivable and an average credit period on sale 


of goods of 87 days.  


 
Figure 6 Artilium 2018 Trade and Other Receivables
Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 7 Artilium Historic Receivables and Credit Analysis 


Artilium’s days receivable has shrunk while the average credit period has increased. The company makes no 


mention of its billing terms, but it can be inferred that Artilium’s customer base as a whole is taking longer to 


pay its bills. We do not believe this loss-making acquisition is an adequate reason to immediately vest Turner’s 


shares. 


3. Keeping it in the family 


Turner’s largesse is not restricted to himself: Pareteum has used his son Rob Turner’s firm InTown legal in 2017 


and 2018. While the quantum of this payment is not large the only disclosure given regarding InTown Legal’s 


services is the cost of its services and their “at-will”.  


 
Figure 8 Pareteum 2018 10-K Related Party Transactions 


InTown legal’s website lists only two personnel: Rob Turner and Yukiko Takeuchi as an outside consultant.  


4. Associations 


While finalizing several reports on Pareteum’s “Questionable dealings” and “benefits”, Viceroy take a look at 


one of Pareteum’s associates.  


On October 23, 2018 Pareteum listed on the NASDAQ7 Pareteum celebrated with the ceremonial NASDAQ bell-


ringing on May 29, 2019. As with most US companies, Pareteum invited their closest associates and advisors to 


the event. Another archetypical red flag being who executives associate with or employ as ‘consultants’. 


Why was Hal Turner’s friend/associate Ibrahim Kurtulus in attendance for the ceremonial bell-ringing8. What is 


Kurtulus’s role for Pareteum?

It's not the first time that Mr. Kurtulus has appeared with Hal Turner and Ted O'Donnell; the trio appear in a 


Facebook post dated May 1, 2019 promoting Pareteum’s  non-existent cryptocurrency operations .

We have not been able to uncover any relationship, business between Kurtulus and Pareteum or any of its 


senior management. However, a FINRA check on Kurtulus shows a blemished past as a broker with several

sanctions to his name including several customer disputes at Windsor Street Capital and opening unauthorized 


trading accounts when not employed. 


 
Figure 11 FINRA BrokerCheck 


Kurtulus made headlines briefly in 2016 and 2017 over a payment to then-National Security Advisor Michael 


Flynn which several outlets connected to an Op-ed piece later written by Flynn10. 


Pareteum’s ability to check the backgrounds of prospective employees is questionable at best, see our report 


on David John Fondots. Viceroy find it hard to believe that Pareteum’s management were unaware of Mr 


David John Fondot’s history at the time of employment. referring to him as David John11.  


As Pareteum appear comfortable with Mr David JohN Fondot’s chequered history, TEUM will have no issue 


with Mr Kurtulus various run-ins with FINRA over the years with customer disputes and settling allegations of 


opening brokerage accounts for individuals without their prior knowledge, authorization, or consent; followed 


by various sanctions12.  


5. Conclusion 


As a recap, Viceroy have exposed “fake” customers, contracts “celebrated” by Pareteum that are highly unlikely 


to ever be fulfilled, simply because the customers are not capable of such sized orders. The receivables are 


simple evidence of that. We envisage Pareteum ignoring the obvious and no doubt celebrate more hollow 


successes similar to their last announcement of earnings. We believe these announcement lack real substance.
