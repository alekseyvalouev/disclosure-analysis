AOB Comments on Property Transactions


Posted on August 7, 2009 by Asensio.com


American Oriental Bioengineering, Inc. (NYSE: AOB) posted


comments on its website concerning the topic of a previous


asensio.com report: AOB’s 2007 and 2008 property transactions and


a potential undisclosed related party. The comments contain


previously undisclosed information. To read the comments, click


here. asensio.com has not received any information separately.


AOB’s comments, also reiterated during its earnings conference call


today, assert that Bestkey remains a wholly-owned subsidiary of


AOB, and that Golden Dragon is a wholly-owned subsidiary of


Bestkey. Taken at face value, these assertions dispel the narrow


concern raised in the previous asensio.com report about the


potential for an undisclosed related party.


The concern stated in the previous asensio.com report was that


since Bestkey had not been listed as a subsidiary of AOB in AOB’s


SEC filings after the 2006 10-K, there was an appearance that Beijing


Century East may have had an undisclosed less-than-arm’s-length


relationship with AOB, since Tony Liu appeared as a director of


Golden Dragon, the entity that acquired Beijing Century East. If AOB


retained full ownership of Bestkey, and Bestkey owned Golden


Dragon, at all times relevant to the transaction, as the company


asserts, then there is no potential for an undisclosed related party,


based solely on changes in ownership disclosures regarding Bestkey


in AOB’s filings.


AOB’s comments state that “the Company received appraisals of


both properties by independent appraisers.” If such is the case, and


such appraisals establish the fair market value for the acquired


properties in a complete and reasonable presentation, it is unlikely


that there was any material misappropriation of investors’ funds.


Given the complexity and duration of the transactions, and given

he does, it’s wise
to pay attention.

the lack of specific description of the properties, their intended use,


and their income-producing potential, it would be constructive for


the company to make further disclosures to U.S. investors


concerning the independent appraisals.


As for the other issue addressed in AOB’s comments, the structuring


of the real estate transactions, it remains up to AOB’s shareholders


to determine whether they find this explanation acceptable, and


whether they require further documentation to evidence the


company’s assertions.


To the extent that AOB’s shareholders and noteholders wish to


complete further evaluation of the merits of the purchase or to


conduct due diligence in this regard, they should direct themselves


to the company.


If AOB shareholders or noteholders wish to understand the finer


points of the real estate transactions, they may wish to address


some questions made apparent by the company’s description of the


transactions’ structure. AOB’s comments state, “Simultaneously


with our subsidiary’s acquisition of BCE, BCE distributed its


ownership in the J Property and the L Property by contract to the


owners of BCE, leaving BCE a shell company.” The comments then


go on to state that the property was then later acquired by AOB in


2008. If that is the case, then it would seem that AOB would have


had to acquire the properties from the individual former owners of


Beijing Century East. The question then arises of why AOB stated in


its January 2009 8-K, referenced in the prior asensio.com report,


that AOB “entered into and consummated a Purchase Agreement


with Beijing Century East,” not the individual former owners of


Beijing Century East.


Furthermore, the comments from AOB state that the $34.9 million


property was acquired in May 2008, and was “properly disclosed in


the Company’s Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2008.” As


referenced in the prior asensio.com report, AOB disclosed


completing the $34.9 million expenditure in the third quarter of


2008, and a disclosure appears regarding the expenditure in the


Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2008.
