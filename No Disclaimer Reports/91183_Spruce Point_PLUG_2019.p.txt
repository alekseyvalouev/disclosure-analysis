Executive Summary

Short PLUG: An Uninvestible Stock.
Long-Term Potential To $0.


• A Long History of Unrealistic Targets and Broken Promises: Management is fond of saying that “we’ll be profitable this year.” It never is (until this year, or so it says). For 
~20 years, management has stoked investor confidence by citing big TAMs, futuristic use-cases, and the latest investor buzzwords, creating a dedicated following of 
growth-oriented retail investors singing PLUG’s praises across internet chatboards. Underneath it all, PLUG has never turned a sustainable profit and has failed time and 
again to meet management’s promotional targets, both near and long-term. Institutional investors have almost entirely exited the stock as they see little reason to 
believe management’s promotional targets – nor that management will keep any promises not to dilute shareholders.


• Dependent on Vendor Financing, Unfavorable Customer Agreements, and Expensive Debt for Growth: While large customer wins have supported sales growth at PLUG 
through the past five years, they came at a steep price. Much of this growth was facilitated by PLUG’s decision to provide expanded lease financing directly to customers 
in ~2014, likely at the behest of large, powerful customers such as Walmart and others. Sale/leaseback agreements with third parties, intended to support this lending, 
have tied up PLUG’s balance sheet in over $150M of restricted cash required by its financing partners to guarantee its leases with customers. PLUG’s attempts to finance 
customer arrangements through other means have resulted in excessive shareholder dilution – by a third of the total float in 2017 alone – despite management’s stated 
commitment to seek financing which would prevent it from having to distribute equity. Maintaining current sales and earnings growth rates will required similar dilution 
or leveraging up, which is becoming more and more unrealistic as the Company’s balance sheet becomes increasingly strained.


• Recent Inflection to Profitability Attributable to Accounting Changes and Non-GAAP Adjustments: Since first embracing vendor financing as a route to growth, PLUG has 
crafted a panoply of non-GAAP metrics designed to recognize sales and profit associated with leased equipment up front. With its recent (accelerated) implementation of 
ASC 842 in late 2018, it was given a golden ticket to undertake the aggressive revenue and profit recognition that it had attempted to do several quarters prior, before 
receiving heavy pushback from SEC comment letters. PLUG immediately restructured its sale/leaseback agreements in late 2018 in a way that allowed it to maximize the 
benefit of this accounting change, and soon thereafter raised revenue guidance on claims of “ongoing development of its business pipeline.” Reversing this accounting 
windfall shows that sales growth and underlying profitability improved little, if at all, through late 2018-19. Further, in its recently-issued non-GAAP metrics, PLUG is also 
attempting to accelerate the top-line benefit of these agreements while removing the impact of inextricably-linked costs, skewing investors’ understanding of profitability.


• Recent “Inflection to Profitability” Excites Investors, But Will Inevitably Be Short-Lived: PLUG shares trade at an all-time high $1.5B valuation and a peak EV/Sales multiple, 
on investor confidence that its recent “inflection” is a sign that the Company has finally turned the profitability corner. However, continued paper profitability will depend 
on continued growth through operating-type sale/leaseback agreements, for which the Company is rapidly running out of capacity given its $180M TTM cash burn and 
ballooning debt . Future growth facilitated by vendor financing, the source of most of its recent growth, must inevitably rely on alternative forms of financing which lack 
the advantageous accounting treatment of operating leasebacks, and which could entail further shareholder dilution.


• Spruce Point’s Conclusion – PLUG  Is Uninvestible With Long-Term Potnetial To $0: PLUG has never generated a meaningful profit in its ~20 year history, and almost all of 
its recent sales and earnings growth has been supported by either unsustainable financing or shareholder dilution. The Company does not have a clear path to profitability 
or steady growth without continuing to access these financing channels, some of which may become inaccessible to it in the near term. There is no reason to own PLUG 
shares unless, and until, the Company proves that it can grow and produce a profit on sustainable financing.


Plug Power (“PLUG” or “the Company”) is a manufacturer of hydrogen fuel cell systems with a ~20 year history of setting unrealistic goals and resorting 
to onerous financing, endless equity raises, and creative accounting to support unsustainable growth. It appears to be repeating this pattern of behavior 


today. The stock has advanced to a five-year high and $1.5B market cap (fully-diluted) on the back of rapid multiple expansion as analysts claim that PLUG 
has turned a corner by producing back-to-back quarters of positive EBITDA – a first for the Company. A closer analysis, however, reveals that this is 


largely attributable to a recent accounting change, amended lease agreements which conveniently take advantage of it, and dubious non-GAAP 
adjustments which defy reasonable accounting logic. Adjusting for these factors wipes out PLUG’s recent “inflection” to profitability and suggests that 


Company economics remain largely unchanged. PLUG has burdened itself with expensive debt and unfavorable customer agreements to support top-line 
growth and the appearance of profitability. A strained balance sheet and rapid cash burn could soon force Company to dilute investors even further, while, 


at the same time, it loses access to the leaseback arrangements supportive of the accelerated sales growth which has made dilution palatable of late.

Spruce Point Has A Strong Track Record In 
Evaluating Hydrogen Fuel Cell Companies


In Jan 2018, Spruce Point published a report on Ballard Power Systems (NASDAQ:BLDP) predicting that its efforts to grow in China would be 
challenged due to concerns regarding its local joint venture. Our analysis was proven correct as Ballard was inevitably forced to find a new JV 


partner to support its expansion efforts in China, ultimately driving the stock from $3.80 at the time of our publication to a low of ~$2.50 almost a 
year later – down 35%, within the range of our downside forecast.


“Our Q3 results and full-year outlook have been 
adversely impacted primarily by recent 
headwinds in the China fuel cell market. These 
headwinds include the relatively slow pace of 
hydrogen fueling station rollout, evolving 
government subsidy rules, and delays in Fuel 
Cell Electric Vehicle, or FCEV, certifications. 
These and other factors are impacting the pace 
of end market adoption with knock-on impacts 
on demand and working capital pressures 
throughout the value chain. These challenges 
resulted in slower than expected stock sales 
by the Synergy-Ballard JV, and a resulting 
buildup of inventory and working capital 
pressures. As a consequence, the Synergy-
Ballard joint venture will not meet its MEA 
purchase commitments for 2018. We continue 
to work with Synergy and other partners to 
address these issues and to support an eventual 
resumption of MEA purchases.”

Systems

“Inflection” To Profitability Appears To Be 
Product of New Lease Accounting


Since adopting the new lease accounting standard in 2018, PLUG discloses the amount of gross profit realized on all operating leaseback 
agreements. Removing this accounting-driven windfall from PLUG EBITDA(S) reveals that, without this benefit, EBITDA(S) has not turned positive 


– and, in fact, would have declined to a two-year low in Q2.
Bulls will argue that the new accounting standard better reflects the economics of the business, and that gross profit associated with leases 


should have been included in all past earnings figures. We disagree – but, even if we didn’t, the below analysis demonstrates that PLUG earnings 
have not changed for the better. Reconstructing EBITDA(S) to treat lease-derived gross profit just as it was treated before Q3 2018 appears to 


demonstrate that the recent “inflection” to profitability was driven entirely by the lease accounting change.


Spruce Point believes that the recent wave of bullishness in PLUG is misplaced. Analysts and investors should reconsider whether PLUG’s 
apparent profitability reflects an improvement in Company performance in any meaningful sense.

PLUG In For A Repeat Of 2016?


Recall that PLUG similarly pursued operating-type sale/leasebacks throughout 2015 before seeking alternative, more cash-flow friendly financing 
arrangements in 2016. So what happened the last time that PLUG pivoted from operating-type to capital-type sale/leasebacks after stretching its 
balance sheet with restricted cash? TTM revenue growth quickly turned negative towards the end of 2015 – perhaps in part because PLUG lost 


the ability to pull forward lease revenue as it transitioned to capital-type leasebacks – and did not significantly recover until the Company 
announced its warrant deals with Amazon and Walmart in late 2017.


When management is inevitably forced to curtail its use of operating-type sale/leasebacks to support sales today, the resulting decline in revenue 
growth could be even more dramatic, as there will be no remaining deferred revenue or profit associated with these operating leasebacks left to 


be recognized in subsequent periods.

Do Investors Fully Understand The Capital 
Structure And Dilution Risk?


PLUG management has shown no reluctance to dilute existing shareholders, whether to raise capital or secure new customers. But do 
shareholders fully understand the extent to which they have been diluted to date, and to which they might be diluted as the Company continues 


to burn cash?

The Holy Grail Of Profitability: Always Just A 
Few Quarters Away


Investors bullish on PLUG see hydrogen fuel cells as a promising, eco-friendly technology with a long runway for growth. The reality is that PLUG 
now has a ~20 year history of consistent unprofitability despite management’s frequent claims that profitability is just around the corner.

Poor Results And Credibility Concerns Keeping 
Smart Investors Away From PLUG?


Spruce Point finds it telling that PLUG has extremely limited institutional ownership. We believe that the speculative nature of the PLUG growth

credibility that PLUG might have once had among the institutional investor community.

Will Even Retail Investors Bail Out If The

Spruce Point notes that even retail investors have grown tired of management’s promotional attitude and penchant for over-promising and under-
delivering on lofty targets. Some view it as a “casino” or “lottery ticket” stock. How much longer will investors be willing to support the stock 


while the Company fails to deliver on promises of faster growth and sustained material profitability?

Loan Agreements Suggest Lenders See PLUG 
As Even Riskier Than Penny Stock Comps


PLUG pays an expensive 12% rate on its $100M term loan with Generate Capital. Meanwhile, FuelCell Energy (NASDAQ:FCEL), a close comp of 
PLUG which is at risk of being de-listed for trading under $1.00 per share, pays only 10.65% on its $25M term loan with Hercules Capital – also 
expensive, but not as cumbersome as PLUG’s burdensome interest. Hercules also does not require FuelCell to post its IP and other various 
assets as collateral. PLUG, however, is required to post all of its domestic assets as collateral for its term loan with Generate. Spruce Point 


believes that lenders are implicitly communicating that they see just as much, if not more risk in PLUG than in its penny-stock peers.

Apparent Inflection In Profitability Has Made 
Bulls Of Sell-Side Analysts – Except For One…


It’s little surprise to us that sell-side analysts are almost universally bullish on PLUG given the recent shift to positive EBITDA(S), however 
tenuous. Never, however, have we observed the analyst at a public company’s lead underwriter assign the stock a rating that might deter 


potential investors. And yet Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter for PLUG’s equity issuance announced this Dec 2, currently rates the stock 
“equal-weight” assigns it a price target of $2.75 per share – over 10% below current levels, and, interestingly, equal to the per-share equity price 


of the issuance. The sell-side analyst at PLUG’s lead underwriter is effectively telling investors that there is no upside to the issuance as it is 
currently priced. Might he see assigning a “buy” rating to such a chatroom stock as a risk to his credibility?

The Shift To Operating Leases: Larger Customers 
Transform the Economics of the Business


Much of PLUG’s growth through the early 2010s can be attributed to just a few large customers, including the likes of Kroger, Volkswagen, and, 
notably, Walmart. Until the early 2010s, most of PLUG’s customers would purchase PLUG’s fuel cells directly or arrange for lease financing 


through a separate financial partner. However, in 2014, large customers such as Walmart appear to have demanded that PLUG offer operating 
leases itself, thereby keeping the equipment off their respective balance sheets. Without a large enough balance sheet of its own to support this, 
PLUG entered into sale/leaseback agreements with a number of financial institutions and independent renewable energy funds to facilitate these 


customer leases.

Leases Quickly Become A Material Source of 
Revenue


It appears that, since PLUG first began to provide operating leases to customers, these leases have become a dominant source of revenue for the 
Company. In 2009, management insinuated that ~25% of shipments went to customers who leased their PLUG equipment (whether through PLUG 


or a third party). However, in its 2014 10-K – not long after PLUG first began to offer operating leases – management claimed that ~25% of its 
revenue was attributable to operating leases facilitated by it sale/leaseback arrangement with M&T Bank. Shortly thereafter, management added a 
risk factor to its Q2 2015 10-Q stating that “customers representing most of our revenue lease, rather than purchase our products.” By Q3 2015, 


management had revealed that 80% of its core GenKey customers leased their equipment. As we will show, this shift to providing expanded 
financing directly to customers came at a significant cost and transformed the underlying economics of the business.


“Your expectations on shipment levels through 2012, do you have a -- as far as the addressable market 
goes, do you have a certain percentage of customers that you think will choose the lease versus to buy 
outright and own? How much project financing are you willing to -- or third-party leasing --”


- Analyst
“In most cases, on the food and retail side, customers outright buy the equipment. On the heavy 
manufacturing side, you may have 40% to 60% of those customers lease the equipment. Because 
we don't know what our deals are yet for those years, I can't tell you what we expect in terms of what the 
mix is between capital purchases and lease financing deals…. 50% of our shipments will be in food.”

The Shift To Direct Financing: Growth Comes At The 
Price of Deteriorating Company Economics


Did PLUG’s new lease arrangements facilitate faster top-line growth? Again, per PLUG’s 2014 10-K, ~25% of company sales came through its 
operating lease agreements with major customers such as Walmart and Volkswagen. However, with these customers already established 


business partners of PLUG’s, it is not entirely clear that these arrangements supported incremental growth, at least in the near term. Rather, 
these arrangements may have simply been forced upon PLUG by major customers which the Company could not afford to lose. Importantly, 
PLUG reported in 2015 that its sale/leaseback partners required the Company to secure its leases in full: cash received from operating-type 


sale/leasebacks would be committed to restricted cash and released over the term of the lease. This in many ways defeated the purpose of the 
financing arrangement by withdrawing the immediate cash flow benefit that it would have otherwise recognized from the sale/leaseback.


With PLUG’s customers appearing to pressure the Company into supporting lease financing which it was ill-equipped to support, Spruce Point 
considers the (continued) shift towards operating lease-backed sales growth as a signal of deteriorating economics at PLUG.

Bloated Restricted Cash Balance Analogous To 
Inflated DSOs


Investors often look to Days Sales Outstanding (DSOs) as a measure of company liquidity, the health of its cash flow, and the sustainability of its 
current sales trajectory: the longer it takes a company to collect cash on booked revenue, the less healthy and sustainable is its financial 


position. PLUG’s restricted cash balance can be thought of as analogous to accounts receivable: revenue booked in advance of cash collection, 
and a burden on Company liquidity as it awaits payment from customers. Treating PLUG’s restricted cash balance as such, we observe that the 
Company’s “effective DSOs” exploded beginning in 2015, as management increasingly turned to operating leases to support revenue growth. 


PLUG’s embrace of direct lease financing to create incremental sales (or to appease large customers) materially transformed Company 
economics for the worse, and any incremental sales created through this mechanism are demonstrably “low-quality” sales.


In growing sales by offering customers direct operating leases – leases which PLUG’s sale/leaseback counterparties forced PLUG to guarantee 
itself – PLUG management effectively manufactured top-line growth by levering up its balance sheet and assuming massive counterparty risk by 


recognizing years’ worth of revenue in advance of receiving the associated cash.


Even if investors deem PLUG’s customers as sufficiently trustworthy, this trend clearly demonstrates that the economics of the business 
transformed for the worse.

Aggressive Non-GAAP Adjustments Reverse 
Negative Consequences of Shift to Leases


PLUG’s shift to providing financing for an increasing share of Company revenue had significant consequences for the Company’s financial 
reporting. Under ASC Topic 840, companies are instructed to recognize revenue on operating-type sale/leaseback transactions only up to the 
corresponding cost of goods. All revenue in excess of the associated COGS is then deferred, as is the corresponding profit. Accordingly, by 


engaging in operating-type sale/leasebacks with third parties rather than selling its equipment outright to customers, PLUG was unable to 
recognize some of the revenue and all of the profit associated with these sales. To make up for this, management devised “Adjusted Revenue” 
and “Adjusted Gross Profit” for its Q4 2015 earnings call, treating leased equipment as though it was sold. PLUG grew even more aggressive in 
2016, when it began to engage in capital-type sale/leasebacks, on which it can recognize no revenue or profit under GAAP rules: management 


added all of the revenue and profit associated with these deals back to its Non-GAAP metrics. By Q2 2016, nearly half of PLUG’s Adjusted 
Revenue, and all of its Adjusted Gross Profit, was attributable to these add-backs.

Aggressive Non-GAAP Adjustments Ignore 
Economic Realities of the Business


Spruce Point strongly believes that PLUG’s adjusted metrics presented a skewed view of Company financials. Management claimed that its 
adjustments were needed to “show our performance as if we finance a transaction as we have in the past.” However, by providing direct 


financing to end users, PLUG materially transformed the structure of many of its customer relationships – and, therefore, its own operating 
model. Regardless of how it financed its leases to customers – in particular, through sale/leasebacks in which it received cash “up front” –


inflows received from financing agreements should be treated as such, and not included in Non-GAAP metrics meant to reflect the operating side 
of the business. This holds particularly true for PLUG, as it was forced to park the up-front cash received on operating-type sale/leasebacks in 


restricted cash to guarantee future lease payments from end users.

PLUG (Temporarily) Eliminates Improper 
Adjustments Due To SEC Pressure?


It appears that the SEC agrees with our assessment of PLUG’s adjusted financial metrics. On Jul 1, 2016, the SEC submitted a letter to PLUG 
questioning management’s non-GAAP metrics, which it deemed “…based on an individually-tailored revenue recognition which is inconsistent 


with the updated Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations….” The SEC would follow-up with two additional letters dated Aug 2 and Sep 23 
further questioning these metrics before PLUG finally eliminated these non-GAAP figures from its Q3 2016 earnings presentation. Of course, this 


did not stop management from continuing to present the adjustments which it would have used to calculate its old adjusted metrics.


“As a reminder, we've been working on a 
number of finance alternatives to 
eliminate the need for new restricted 
cash or PPA deals where Plug Power 
finances the assets directly. In some, or 
likely all, of the new financing scenarios 
the cat profile of the transaction will be 
much better. But the accounting rules 
dictate we cannot recognize revenues 
up front as we've done with traditional 
sale-leaseback arrangements. The 
presentation of adjusted numbers is 
intended to show our performance as 
if we finance a transaction as we have 
in the past. Again, we believe it provides 
a clearer picture of the sales and 
implementation progress of the Company 
and a consistent comparison to past 
performance.”

Better Financing Terms Come At The Expense 
of Shareholders


In 2017, management announced that it had expanded terms with Walmart and Amazon without having to commit additional capital towards 
restricted cash. However, this came at the cost of heavy shareholder dilution: the Company granted Walmart and Amazon warrants to acquire up 


to 55.3M PLUG shares each, cumulatively just under 50% of the total float at the time. While these deals were worth a total of $150M in future 
sales (per management), it appears that PLUG’s large customers have little trouble demanding preferential terms from PLUG, and that PLUG 
would not be able to grow sales with its most material partners without diluting shareholders, tying up its balance sheet in restricted cash, or 
otherwise accepting unfavorable terms. This raises serious questions as to the Company’s ability to generate profitable growth in the future.

Warrant Deals Likely Not An Indication Of 
Interest In Owning PLUG


Bullish investors are quick to interpret these warrant deals as indications that Amazon and Walmart are interested in making strategic 
investments in PLUG. However, it is not uncommon for Amazon in particular to strike deals involving warrants with suppliers (particularly of 


commodity products) or other partners, particularly smaller ones. Spruce Point sees these deals as a sign that Amazon and Walmart used their 
leverage as major customers to secure advantageous terms from a producer

More Accounting Games To Show The 
Appearance of Faster Top-Line Growth


Warrants weren’t a perfect method for growing sales on paper: per GAAP rules, PLUG was forced to treat warrant-related expenses as a contra-
account against revenue. Accordingly, PLUG could not recognize as revenue all sales generated by these agreements. Furthermore, much like 


revenue generated by PLUG’s operating leases, all revenue attributable to these deals generated no gross profit. Management’s solution? 
Prominently display “Gross Revenue” in its quarterly letters, and add its provision for warrants back to gross profit to create a new “Adjusted 
Gross Profit” metric. As it is unlikely that management would have been able to secure these deals without these costly warrant agreements, 
Spruce Point believes that any presentation of gross profit which includes the revenue generated by these deals, but excludes the associated 


warrant costs, is deceptive.

Revenue COGS


New Accounting Guidance Gives Management a 
Chance To Practice Old Leaseback Accounting


In late 2018, PLUG early-adopted ASC Topic 842, FASB’s updated guidance on lease accounting. Whereas, under ASC 840, lessees in operating-
type sale/leaseback transactions were instructed to recognize associated revenue only up to the corresponding COGS, ASC 842 now permits 


such lessees to recognize all associated revenue and profit immediately.
Spruce Point acknowledges that, in recognizing revenue and profit associated with operating-type sale/leasebacks up front, management is no 


longer bending GAAP accounting rules, regardless of whether the resulting financials accurately reflect the underlying economics of the 
business. However, we also find that, shortly after adopting this accounting standard, the Company undertook several measures which should 


raise questions among investors as to whether recent improvements in Company financials are sustainable or meaningful in any sense.

Sacrificing Liquidity To Revert To Operating-
Type Sale/Leasebacks?


In Q2 2016, management announced a new approach to project financing under which (A) PLUG would no longer have to restrict cash balances 
received from financing partners, and (B) PLUG would take ownership of the equipment at the end of the lease term. Without saying as much, 


management was communicating to investors that it was now structuring its sale/leaseback agreements as capital leases, under which 
management would not be able to recognize any revenue or profit up front, but which would not tie up Company liquidity in restricted cash. 


Despite strongly voicing the importance of this decision for Company cash flow at the time, management was quick to restructure (and expand) 
its lease agreement with Wells Fargo in Q3 2018 – the same quarter in which it adopted ASC 842 – to change the associated “end of lease term 


options.” Soon thereafter management added a disclosure to its Q3 2018 10-Q that it was now accounting for this deal as an operating lease and, 
accordingly, recognizing all associated revenue up front.


Spruce Point finds it interesting that management restructured this lease agreement just as new lease accounting standards permitted it to 
recognize associated revenue and profit up front. If nothing else, this suggests that subsequent revenue and earnings growth are not necessarily 


indicative of a meaningful improvement in Company fundamentals.

Conveniently-Timed Revenue Guidance 
Increase


On Oct 16, 2018 – again, shortly after PLUG adopted FASB’s updated lease accounting guidance – management issued a press release
announcing increased revenue guidance, raising the full-year (gross revenue) range from $155-180M to $175-190M “due to continued traction in 
the market and ongoing development of its business pipeline.” It’s curious enough that management raised full-year revenue guidance by a full 
$15M (at the midpoint) with just one quarter of revenue remaining in the year to meet this high bar. It’s perhaps even more interesting that, in its 


10-K, PLUG disclosed that “gross profit on sale/leaseback transactions for all operating leases was $16.4 million for the year ended December 31, 
2018.” This gross profit would have represented the sale/leaseback revenue “overhang” which PLUG was not allowed to recognize up front until 


adopting the new accounting standard in Q3/Q4 2018 – and is almost equivalent in magnitude to management’s revenue guidance increase, 
which, again, it attributed entirely to improving fundamentals.


Can management confirm that it raised full-year revenue guidance in Q4 2018 by nearly 10% entirely due to improving fundamentals, and not due 
to changes in the manner in which it would account for sale/leaseback inflows?

PLUG Piles Back Into Operating-Type Sale/ 
Leasebacks After Shunning Them in 2016


Again, in Q2 2016, management tacitly announced plans to structure future sale/leaseback agreements as capital leases in the interest of 
enhancing Company liquidity. This is reflected in PLUG’s restricted cash balance between 2017 and most of 2018: restricted cash declined as 


gross profit was recognized over the lives of the customer leases, and as PLUG initiated no new operating-type sale/leaseback agreements 
requiring Company guarantees. Management claimed that this was an important step towards “accelerating cash flows” while avoiding 
shareholder dilution. Why, then, did management rush back into operating-type sale/leaseback agreements starting in Q3 2018, just as it 
announced its adoption of a new lease accounting standard which would allow it to recognize associated revenue and profit up front?

Sacrificing Liquidity – And Shareholders – For 
The Sake of Accounting-Driven Growth?


As discussed, because operating-type sale/leaseback agreements require PLUG to tie up its balance sheet in restricted cash, they do not offer the 
liquidity relief for which the Company sought sale/leasebacks in the first place. How, then, did management address its increasingly strained 


balance sheet as it rushed back into operating leasebacks while at the same time burning significant cash each quarter? On Dec 2, management 
announced plans to return to equity markets yet again, this time offering another 40M shares – over 15% of the current (basic) float. Recall that, at 
the same time that it announced its plans to shift from operating to capital-type leasebacks for liquidity purposes, management cited its desire to 


avoid diluting shareholders as one of its primary motivations. Why is management now abandoning this goal?


“So let me reiterate our key goals around liquidity and funding our growth. Our key goals remain to continue driving more 
efficient and seamless direct customer and PPA financing platforms, avoid restricting additional cash, maintain 
sufficient working capital to support the growing backlog of deployments and avoid dilution of existing equity owners.
In regards to our PPA financing approach, our primary goal is simple. We are focused on accelerating cash flows and 
maximizing the return on investment. We have been using this PPA approach since early 2014 and we have often found it a 
strategical advantage in accelerating customer adoption and improving our product offering and margin profile. But it's critical 
we continue developing improved capital solutions to fund these programs.”
- Paul Middleton – CFO, Plug Power


PLUG Q2 FY16 Earnings Call


Dec 2, 2019: Announcement of Proposed Public Offering


Spruce Point is concerned that management is sacrificing liquidity for faster top-line growth – growth which is not reflective of improving 
fundamentals, but which we believe is simply attributable to (1) a shift in how management accounts for operating leasebacks and (2) a rapid re-


adoption of operating-type sale/leaseback agreements which are now being recognized as revenue in full up front.

Adjusted EBITDA(S)


Equity Raises Facilitated By Renewed Confidence in 
PLUG Profitability – But Has PLUG Really Changed?


Despite these concerning developments, sell-side analysts and the investor community remain bullish on the stock. This, indeed, was perhaps an 
enabling factor in management’s decision to issue equity: swapping capital leasebacks for operating leasebacks sacrificed liquidity, but the 


subsequent (accounting-driven) sales growth has supported extremely elevated valuations, making now a convenient time for an equity raise. In 
particular, investors are bullish about the fact that, for the first time in its ~20 year history, PLUG is reporting positive EBITDA(S). However, given 


its recent accounting changes, it’s worth asking whether recent growth in sales and earnings really represents an “inflection point” for the 
business in any meaningful sense.

“Inflection” To Profitability Appears To Be 
Product of New Lease Accounting


Since adopting the new lease accounting standard in 2018, PLUG discloses the amount of gross profit realized on all operating leaseback 
agreements. Removing this accounting-driven windfall from PLUG EBITDA(S) reveals that, without this benefit, EBITDA(S) has not turned positive 


– and, in fact, would have declined to a two-year low in Q2.
Bulls will argue that the new accounting standard better reflects the economics of the business, and that gross profit associated with leases 


should have been included in all past earnings figures. We disagree – but, even if we didn’t, the below analysis demonstrates that PLUG earnings 
have not changed for the better. Reconstructing EBITDA(S) to treat lease-derived gross profit just as it was treated before Q3 2018 appears to 


demonstrate that the recent “inflection” to profitability was driven entirely by the lease accounting change.


Spruce Point believes that the recent wave of bullishness in PLUG is misplaced. Analysts and investors should reconsider whether PLUG’s 
apparent profitability reflects an improvement in Company performance in any meaningful sense.

True Profitability Remains Clouded By Dubious 
Adjustments


Now included in management’s EBITDA adjustments are interest expenses associated with its leaseback financing. However, much like the cost 
of the warrants associated with the 2017 Walmart and Amazon deals, the revenue associated with these lease expenses would be unavailable to 
PLUG without these financing arrangements, particularly as it recognizes an increasing amount of this revenue up front. Spruce Point believes 
that removing these costs from EBITDA only renders management’s presentation of Company profitability more out-of-line with the underlying 


economics of the business.

If management recognizes as revenue sales related to leaseback arrangements – sales which exist only because PLUG is willing to provide

Free Cash Flow


FCF Before Changes in Restricted Cash FCF (Spruce Point)


Free Cash Flow: The Best View Into PLUG 
Economics


How should investors evaluate PLUG’s profitability? The majority of our criticisms with PLUG’s presentation of its earnings power are, in effect, 
cash flow arguments: we take issue with the fact that management is reporting accelerated growth in sales and earnings which exists only 


because it is leveraging its balance sheet to guarantee future payments from end users to banks. For a business whose customers largely lease 
its equipment, payments received from end users over time are a better reflection of both underlying company economics and company cash 
flow – since, in PLUG’s case, its restricted cash is unlocked only as these payments are made. Therefore, Spruce Point believes that free cash 


flow is the best measure of PLUG’s profitability. Importantly, however, for the same reason that we concluded that restricted cash was analogous 
to accounts receivable, changes in restricted cash should be subtracted from PLUG’s earnings to calculate Company FCF. It’s interesting to note 
that management stopped reporting changes to restricted cash on its cash flow statement after FY17. Regardless, these changes are of course 


not difficult to calculate independently.


With management tying up significant sums of cash in sale/leaseback agreements to support continued sales and earnings growth – particularly 
with its newfound incentive to structure leasebacks as operating leases – PLUG FCF is consistently and dramatically negative.


PLUG will likely once again be forced to find alternative mechanisms to finance its customer leases outside of operating-type sale/leasebacks. 
With sales and earnings recently inflated by accelerated revenue and profit recognition – facilitated by ASC 842 – any such change would come 


against difficult comps and appear even more dramatic than it otherwise would.

operating leases – as it has through 


recent quarters – requires a serious, and 
likely unsustainable, capital commitment 


for PLUG
Ending its “investment” in operating 


leasebacks, however, would dramatically 
slow sales growth and undo the 


“inflection” to profitability

FCF Before Changes in Restricted Cash FCF (Spruce Point)


Balance Sheet Stretched Too Thin to Support Much 
More Growth-Accelerating Operating Leasebacks


The extent to which PLUG has strained its balance sheet should not be ignored. Excluding restricted cash, PLUG’s net debt stood at $410M at Q3-
end, up from $234M at the beginning of this year and just $79M at year-end 2017 (assuming no converts are exercised). Ending its use of 


operating-type leasebacks would slow the cash burn – $184M through the past twelve months, including restricted cash – but would dramatically 
slow sales and earnings growth against difficult comps created by the recent accounting-driven revenue “pull-forward.” Doing so would also 


reverse PLUG’s recent “inflection” to profitability, which, again, is reliant on continued revenue pull-forwards enabled by operating-type 
leasebacks. This “profitability” inflection will likely be short-lived as management is forced to pursue alternative forms of financing which do not 


feature the new accounting benefits of operating leasebacks. Otherwise, shareholders will experience extremely dramatic dilution.


Spruce Point believes that PLUG cannot issue equity or raise debt fast enough to support its current restricted cash build – and, therefore, cannot 
continue to support customer leases through operating-type leasebacks, the source of the Company’s recent “inflection” to profitability.
Spruce Point believes that this “inflection” to profitability will reverse in the coming quarters without either (1) egregious (and perhaps 


prohibitive) levels of shareholder dilution, (2) unsustainable borrowing, or (3) extremely aggressive non-GAAP accounting adjustments designed 
to present sustained profitability.

PLUG In For A Repeat Of 2016?


Recall that PLUG similarly pursued operating-type sale/leasebacks throughout 2015 before seeking alternative, more cash-flow friendly financing 
arrangements in 2016. So what happened the last time that PLUG pivoted from operating-type to capital-type sale/leasebacks after stretching its 
balance sheet with restricted cash? TTM revenue growth quickly turned negative towards the end of 2015 – perhaps in part because PLUG lost 


the ability to pull forward lease revenue as it transitioned to capital-type leasebacks – and did not significantly recover until the Company 
announced its warrant deals with Amazon and Walmart in late 2017.


When management is inevitably forced to curtail its use of operating-type sale/leasebacks to support sales today, the resulting decline in revenue 
growth could be even more dramatic, as there will be no remaining deferred revenue or profit associated with these operating leasebacks left to 


be recognized in subsequent periods.

Spruce Point’s “Valuation”: PLUG Stock
Is Uninvestible. Long-Term Potential To $0.


It’s standard practice for investors to value unprofitable companies on a multiple of sales. But how valuable is the revenue of a relatively mature 
industrial company which has not been able to turn a profit for its entire twenty-year history, and whose incremental growth either generates zero 


margin or is financed directly by its own balance sheet?
Even if one accepts that PLUG is not profitable today, but believes that the costly growth is justified on the belief that the proverbial operating 


leverage will eventually kick in, should an investor be willing to wait around for this to happen while management dilutes shareholders to no end? 
Spruce Point believes that investors should not consider owning this stock until management demonstrates that it can grow sales profitably and 


without stretching its own balance sheet, and commits to refraining from turning to the equity market to finance this growth.


So long as management is able to generate growth by only (1) striking zero margin deals with large customers or (2) using its own liquidity as 
currency in direct leasing deals (while shoring up its balance sheet through endless dilution in the meantime), Spruce Point sees no path for 


management to generate profitable growth or deliver sustainable value to shareholders.
