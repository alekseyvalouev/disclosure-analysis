CTE’s mysterious “import agent” Dongying Luda
Petrochemical Equipment Co., Ltd.


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


According to SinoTech Energy Limited, Inc.’s (NASDAQ: CTE $2.80)


Form 20-F for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2010, CTE relies


exclusively on a company called Dongying Luda Petrochemical


Equipment Co., Ltd. (“Dongying Luda” or “DL”) to import its LHD


units from Jet Drill Well Services, Inc. DL purportedly provides


assembly, testing and fine-tuning services and ancillary tools and


equipment related to CTE’s Jet Drill LHD units.


CTE filed three contracts covering the purchase of ten LHD units


from Jet Drill with Dongying Luda as exhibits to its Form F-1/A for


its initial public offering dated November 3, 2010. A copy of these


contracts is available here. We conducted research on all of the


representatives associated with Dongying Luda on U.S. and Chinese


search engines including Google, EDGAR, Nexis, Baidu and Factivia


and found no mention of them being involved with the LHD


industry or the assembling or design or manufacturing of LHD


ancillary tools and equipment.


More recently, CTE filed a copy of a fourth contract covering the


purchase of additional ten LHD units with Dongying Luda. Click


here to see it. The contract is signed by a Xinkuan Quan, on DL’s


behalf. Together the four contracts cover all twenty LHD units


purportedly owned by CTE.


The contracts demonstrate certain irregularities. They are only


three pages long. The terms used lack the specificity that is standard


for the international purchase of complex capital equipment of this


value. An example of the specifications included in a typical


contract between a LHD manufacturer and a buyer, such as CTE, is


available here for comparison purposes. CTE’s contracts with


Dongying Luda contain no such specifications. The payment dates

in some of the Dongying Luda contracts required payment on a


fixed delivery date with no explanation of what would occur if the


units are not delivered on the fixed delivery date. This would not be


an acceptable term in a standard contract of this type. Payments for


the units are set after they are “tested and accepted” without


establishing any standards to test the units or establishing a


procedure for settlement of disputes. Also, the contracts do not have


an address or a statement of where the incorporation called


Dongying Luda legally existed.


We checked with two LHD companies operating in China and


conducted our own search and were unable to verify that Dongying


Luda operates in the LHD and LHD ancillary tools and equipment


industry independently of CTE, much less on the scale suggested by


CTE’s disclosures.


We were only able to find mention of Dongying Luda on the


Dongying Municipal Bureau of Commerce website, which provided


no information other than its name included on a spread sheet


titled, “2010 Dongying City Advanced Technology and Equipment


Import and 2011 Projected Import Survey” where Dongying Luda


Petrochemical Equipment was listed along with 80 other


companies. The spread sheet is available here.


We verified that a company named Dongying Luda Petrochemical


Equipment Co., Ltd. is registered in China with an address at 6


District Dongmei Renyuan Area Floor 3 number 313, City. This


information is available at the Dongying City Administration’s web


site available here.


Miao Zhijun, who signed one of the four contracts between CTE and


Dongying Luda, is shown as Dongying Luda’s Legal Representative


on this site. Interestingly, we found that Dongying Luda was


registered with the SAIC in September 2007, just weeks before


Ernest Cheung entered into the equity transfer with Guoqiang Xin,


Fengkai Liu and Fengshan Liu on October 12, 2007. Also interesting


is that CTE purportedly entered into its first contract with Dongying


Luda on July 1, 2007, before Dongying Luda as a company was


registered.


Each of the four contracts we reviewed is executed by one of three


individuals unidentified as a Legal Representative for Dongying


Luda. The individuals signing as Dongying Luda’s Legal


Representative are named Xinkuan Quan, Zheng Yan, and Miao


Zhijun. None of these individuals are known to be involved with the


manufacturing of LHD rigs.
