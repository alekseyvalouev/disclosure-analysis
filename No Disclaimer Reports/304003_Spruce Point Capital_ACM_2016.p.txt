AECOM Levered Up At The Top of the 
Oil/Gas Market To Acquire URS Corp


• AECOM (“ACM” or “the Company”) is a global engineering and construction firm based in Los Angeles, and is an enormous 
roll-up that came public in 2007. Bowing to pressure from an activist to maximize shareholder value, URS Corp (URS) sold itself 
in October 2014 to AECOM (for approx. $5bn – a cash/stock deal which included the assumption of $1bn in URS debt). The 
URS deal is the largest in AECOM’s history. AECOM’s pro forma leverage at closing of 4.4x was forecasted by the Company to 
decline to 2.0x by 2017 due to “strong free cash flows” – a claim Spruce Point will put to rigorous scrutiny! 


• The URS deal was touted as giving AECOM “heft” in the oil and gas market, at exactly the wrong time! As shown by the 
investor presentation, URS also added exposure to the mining and industrial sectors – other areas that have shown persistent 
weakness since 2014


• The company predicted 25% accretion to “Cash EPS” and noted $250m of synergies. Commenting on the deal, analyst Will 
Gabrielski of Stephens (ironically now AECOM’s VP, IR) said, “You couldn’t have had a better marriage of two companies that 
complement each other’s skill sets, scope and capabilities so well. They both have the federal government as a large customer, 
but there is very little overlap in what they do,” he said. “It’s a great value for both companies.”

Substantial Accounting Issues Plague 
AECOM, Proceed With Caution


 Spruce Point has been following AECOM, and has generally viewed its post-deal financial results with skepticism. Our view was 
fortified when on Aug 10, 2016 after reporting Q3’16 results, AECOM filed an amended 10-K/A and noted the following: 


“Our management has reassessed and concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was ineffective as of 
September 30, 2015, due to the existence of a material weakness that existed at the end of fiscal year 2015 that is described 
further below. In our third quarter of fiscal year 2016, management discovered deficiencies associated with the acquisition of URS 
Corporation related to (a) the alignment of accounting policies specific to forward loss reserves and (b) income tax accounts.” 


 Trying to downplay this issue, AECOM stated further that: “These deficiencies did not have a material impact on the Company's 
previously reported financial results for the year ended September 30, 2015, and the Company recorded in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2016 an immaterial cumulative adjustment.”


 Given recent disclosures, Spruce Point felt it necessary to make our analysis public with the goal of allowing investors to assess 
how material AECOM’s accounting issues are. In our opinion, investors should be very concerned about the following issues:


 AECOM’s Adjusted EPS vs. GAAP Results Are Wildly Diverging: AECOM has changed its EPS definition three times since selling 


investors on the URS deal. Not surprisingly, each change makes the number more inflated. AECOM is now adding back “non-


core operating losses” and “expected and actual asset sales” even though it told investors no divestitures were planned at deal 


inception. Even more alarming, in Q2’16 it booked pension curtailment gains to revenue and EPS to claim an earnings beat!


 AECOM Has Incessantly Changed the URS Purchase Price Allocation: Even though GAAP says that final intangible and goodwill 


allocation has to be completed within 12 months of closing, AECOM is still making changes 18 months later! 


 AECOM Appears To Have Set-up a Cookie Jar Reserve: for “billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts” that include a 


margin fair value liability associated with long-term contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of URS. AECOM has 


repeatedly changed its disclosure about the value of the margin liability accounted for at its inception, and continues to 


change its value 18 months later. The reversal of the margin liability has allowed AECOM to book free revenue with 100% 


margin! We estimate this reserve has been used to book $149m of revenues and $0.73 cents of earnings!

AECOM Concerns (cont’d)


 Questionable Synergies: AECOM boosted its estimate of cost savings synergies from $250m to $325m shortly after its CFO 


was rotated out of his position to become President at the end of FY Sept 2015. According to our analysis of recent industry 


mega deals, AECOM has promised the largest synergy targets seen in the E&C industry by a wide margin


 Evidence of Poor Financial Planning or Worse: We are skeptical of AECOM’s synergy targets because AECOM grossly 


misestimated acquisition and integration costs (“A&I”), along with amortization of acquired intangibles. According to its 


own estimate, AECOM expected 2015 costs to be $290m and amortization of $250m, but actual results came in +37% and 


+44%  above estimates, respectively. Total A&I costs are now estimated to reach a lofty $626m! This heightens our worry 


that AECOM could be running regular costs through its income statement, and trying to disguise them as deal costs


 Free Cash Flow Appears Overstated: AECOM has shown three different definitions of Free Cash Flow! In the proxy it 


showed URS’s free cash flow as adjusted for noncontrolling distributions, a definition we view as accurate. It currently does


not remove distributions, and later changed to “capital expenditures net of asset sales.” In our view, this adjustment is very 


aggressive and not common. Lastly, we note that AECOM includes accounts receivable financing activities, as well as excess 


joint venture dividends above equity earnings, as part of operating cash flow. By adjusting for these items and distributions


to noncontrolling interests, we believe free cash flow is overstated by approximately 90% in the LTM ending June 30th


 Plummeting Tax Rate: AECOM noted issues with its tax accounts w/out discussing specifics. We observe that its forecasted 


effective tax rate fell from 32% in Dec ‘14 to 24% as of June ‘16. In the last quarter, its estimated tax rate fell by 300bps! 


 AECOM Capital Could Further Distort Earnings and Cash Flows: Management is trying to condition investors to expect that 


capital fund sales should be viewed as “core” earnings and operating cash flows. It has already booked $16m of gains in 


2015, and is telling investors to expect more in the next 12 months. These irregular gains can hardly be considered “core” 


 Rising Interest Expense Revision and Debt Covenant Step-Up: AECOM just raised its interest cost estimate by $15m, yet 


has reduced its total and floating rate exposure. It says its exposure to a 1% move in rates should add $16m of costs. We 


estimate rates have only moved 25bps; something doesn’t add up! AECOM’s credit agreement ties its interest cost to its 


leverage. Did AECOM just signal that its EBITDA will be falling (leverage rising)? Its stated 6/30/16 leverage is 4.3x and 


come Sept 30th, its leverage covenant drops to 4.75x - leaving AECOM very little cushion
8


Terrible Risk/Reward of Owning AECOM; 
33% - 45% Downside Potential


 Rampant Governance Concerns Raises Questions Why Anyone Would Own AECOM:


 Management Has Almost Zero Alignment with Shareholders: Since coming public in 2007, insider ownership has declined from 


13.5% to a pathetic 1.1%.  When thinking about the totality of our concerns, investors need to consider that management has virtually 


nothing at risk if AECOM doesn’t perform 


 Excessive CEO Comp Tied to Inflated Adj. Free Cash Flow: AECOM’s CEO (also its Board Chairman) netted $18m in comp (inc. a $5m 


special performance for the URS deal (one we view as a disaster)). Management boldly tried to sell investors that it produced $4.59 of 


FCF/share in 2015, +52% over the prior year. In our view, this measure is grossly inflated, and fails to account for key adjustments to 


remove financed receivables, excess distributions from unconsolidated subsidiaries, and distributions to noncontrolling interests. With 


these adjustments, we find that AEOCM’s 2015 normalized FCF/share was $2.36 and declined by 9% from 2014


 AECOM’s Knows How to Make News:  In the past year, there’ve been rampant allegations of misconduct, open investigations, lawsuits 


and settlements on a global basis involving AECOM. To illustrate, it agreed to pay $20.2m to resolve a US investigation into an alleged 


fraudulent overbilling scheme, paid $201m to settle an Australia Toll-Road lawsuit (one of the largest settlements related to 


misleading and deceptive conduct in Australian history), faced a federal lawsuit related to systematically defrauding NASA, and is 


being investigated by the Dept. of Energy for its role in the Hanford Nuclear Reservation


 Trading Near 52 Week And All-Time Highs, Shares Are Fully Valued With A Terrible Risk/Reward Owning AECOM


 AECOM’s Looks “Cheap” – Buyer Beware: Trading at 11x Price/16E EPS vs. peers at 14.0x, AECOM looks cheap, but in our view its Adj. 


EPS is fraught with overstatement. Based on our adjustments, it trades at close to 19x, a substantial premium. AECOM is levered 4.3x 


Debt / EBITDA leaving little room for error, but by adjusting its Debt to include its unfunded pension and sizeable operating leases and 


normalizing its EBITDA, true leverage is closer to 7.4x! 


 Even Analysts Seem To Agree:  The average price target is little more than $35/sh and analysts’ are more neutral than positive


 Meaningful Downside Potential: Given numerous accounting distortions to EPS, we believe the best way to value AECOM is on a 


multiple of LTM Free Cash Flow. Applying a range of 9x – 11x on $2.10 of LTM FCF per share, we get $19 - $23/sh (33-45% downside)
9


In Our View, True Free Cash Flow Estimated 
90% Lower Than Presented By AECOM


AECOM’s cash flow should also be adjusted by removing net distributions to noncontrolling interests because its 


operating cash flow starts with consolidated net income, and needs to remove the claims held by these interests. 


By normalizing AECOM’s free cash flow to remove financed receivables sales, excess JV dividends, and 


distributions to noncontrolling interests, we find substantial overstatement in AECOM’s Adj. Free Cash Flow.

Nuts and Bolts of the Issues

URS Deal Has Failed To Meet Expectations


AECOM received initial estimates from URS, but made adjustments in June 2014 based on its independent 


due diligence investigation of URS. Actual URS results have underperformed even AECOM’s already 


discounted estimates by a wide margin! AECOM said URS contributed $8.5bn in sales vs. $10.1bn expected

Alarming GAAP / Non-GAAP Disparity


AECOM has historically shown a large divergence between GAAP and Non-GAAP. While recent 


results appear to show some convergence (smaller delta), we will illustrate later in the presentation 


that cash flow is deteriorating and exhibiting YoY contraction.

Acquisition Accounting 101


Accounting rules are crystal clear that changes to intangible assets and goodwill must be completed 


within 12 months of the acquisition date. In the case of AECOM, which closed its URS deal Oct 2014 


(within the Dec 2014 quarter), it suggests that AECOM should have finalized its allocation by 


Dec 2015. However, this is not the case and it is still muddling with URS’ valuation 18 months later!


Source: PWC guide, Business Combinations and Non-controlling interests, Application of the US GAAP and IFRS Standards, 2nd edition Feb 2016


PricewaterhouseCoopers Acquisition Accounting Guidance


“The fair values of identifiable net assets recognised in a business combination may be 
based on the provisional fair values available at the time of the acquisition. The fair value of 
these assets and liabilities and the resulting amount of any goodwill must be finalised no 
later than 12 months from the acquisition date. Goodwill, as the residual, is not finally 
determined until the fair value exercise is complete. A change to goodwill arising from the 
completion of the fair value exercise is not an impairment.”

Booking Free Revenue and Income!


In the second quarter after closing URS in March 2015, AECOM started disclosing in its footnote fillings 


that billings in excess of costs on uncompleted contracts include a margin fair value liability associated 


with long-term contracts acquired in connection with the acquisition of URS.


AECOM has repeatedly changed its disclosure about the value of the margin liability accounted for at its 


inception, and continues to change its value 18 months later!

Cumulative EPS Benefit Estimated 
Up To $0.73 Cents


Reversal of the fair value margin liability has resulted in “free” revenue and margin to AECOM of 


approximately $149 million. We estimate the cumulative effect on its EPS to be approx. $0.64 cents 


and AECOM stands to benefit by an additional $0.09 cents per share from running the remaining 


liability of $17.8m to maturity (1)

Deal Cost Forecasting #ERROR


The difference between AECOM’s forecasted deal costs and amortization vs. reality came in +37% 


and +44% above estimates. This appears to be more than just a casual oversight!


Prior to the URS deal closing, AECOM made the following statement in its 10-K (p. 56) for the year 
ended Sept 30, 2014


“We expect to incur approximately $250 million of amortization of intangible assets expense and $290 
million of acquisition and integration expense in the next 12 month”


But in reality, for the year ended Sept 30, 2015 AECOM reported in its 10-K (p. 35 & 84) $398.4m and 
$361.6m acquisition and integration expense and intangible amortization, respectively 


“Amortization of intangible assets relating to URS was $361.6 million during the twelve months ended 
September 30, 2015 since the acquisition date.”


Acquisition and integration expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
comprised of the following (in millions):

Beware of Abnormally High Costs Being 
Classified As Deal Related


When compared with recent multibillion dollar E&C deals, the AECOM / URS transaction is a 


significant outlier on every metric we’ve analyzed. AECOM significantly boosted the $250m cost 


synergy target in Sept 2015 (to $325m) upon the transitioning of the CFO, and while global energy 


markets were under extreme pressure. What’s most alarming is that projected acquisition and 


integration costs of $625m are unusually large, which raises the possibility that AECOM is running 


ordinary expenses through this account and attempting to justify them as deal costs.

Decaying “Earnings” Quality


Below are key financial forecasts for AECOM post URS closing in Oct 2014. In our opinion, the 


quality of earnings has decayed and needs to be scrutinized. The company has repeatedly 


lowered its effective tax rate, boosted synergies substantially and increased interest expense 


costs, yet its FY 2016 Adj. EPS guidance this year is unchanged.  We will also show how the 


company has made subtle definition changes to optically increase its results.

Decaying “Free Cash Flow” Quality


In the merger proxy (p. 96), AECOM defined URS’ free cash flow as follows, a very conservative and 
appropriate definition in our view:


“Free cash flow is defined herein as operating cash flow less capital expenditures and non-
controlling interest distributions.”


Yet, AECOM’s new discussion of free cash flow in Q1 2015 used the following definition, dropping 
non-controlling interest distributions


“Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures and is a non-
GAAP measure”


In March 2015, AECOM appointed CEO Michael Burke to Chairman of the Board. By the next 
quarter in Q2 May 2015, AECOM made its definition even more egregious in our opinion by 
including asset disposals:


“Free cash flow is defined as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures net of 
proceeds from disposals, and is a non-GAAP measure”


AECOM has made aggressive changes to its definition of Free Cash Flow. Its most recent 


definition to include proceeds from asset sales is not market standard in our opinion.

Decaying Adjusted EPS Quality…


On the day AECOM announced the URS acquisition, it held a conference call to discuss the transaction:


FBR Analyst: “A lot of questions have been asked so I'll be brief. Are there any asset divestitures that could accelerate the 
debt paydown over the next two years that have been contemplated or maybe considered”
ACM CFO: “There's nothing material. We know that URS has been looking at various things, but again they're not material.”


AECOM’s initial “Cash EPS“ definition (now “Adjusted EPS”) has been a moving target ever since sold to the Street


Deal Announcement Presentation: “Cash EPS” Defined as GAAP EPS + after-tax per share amortization of acquisition 
intangibles and stock-based consideration from accelerated vesting of performance shares


Q3’15: “Adjusted EPS” Defined as attributable to AECOM, excluding acquisition and integration related expenses, 
financing charges in interest expense, and the amortization of intangible assets.


Q4’15: “Adjusted EPS” Defined as attributable to AECOM, excluding acquisition and integration related expenses, 
financing charges in interest expense, the amortization of intangible assets, and financial impacts associated with 
expected dispositions of non-core businesses or assets


Q3’16: “Adjusted EPS” (double emphasis by AECOM) Defined as attributable to AECOM, excluding financial impacts 
associated with expected and actual dispositions of non-core businesses or assets, acquisition and integration related 
expenses, financing charges in interest expense, the amortization of intangible assets, and financial impacts associated 
with expected and actual dispositions of non-core businesses and assets”


There appears to be no limit as to how crafty AECOM can get when defining its Adjusted EPS. Also 


upon appointment of the new CFO, AECOM quickly added adjustments for disposals, which where 


never originally contemplated from the deal

Pension Gains As Revenues?


Spruce Point has observed dozens of accounting shenanigans over the years, but has never seen 


one where a company books revenue related to an accelerated pension curtailment! In Q2’16, 


AECOM recorded $45m of revenue in its Management Service segment and a $0.14 cent benefit, 


which appears to have required significant management judgement. AECOM disclaimed that the 


actual reimbursement may vary from the expectation.  


AECOM made the following disclosure Q3’16 10-Q, p. 17:   


“During the three months ended March 31, 2016 the Company recorded revenue and a noncurrent asset related 
to the expected accelerated recovery of a pension related entitlement from the federal government of 
approximately $45 million. The actual amount of reimbursement may vary from the Company’s expectation.”


Responding to Analyst Cook on the Q2’16 Conference Call, CFO Rudd:


“On the guidance, Jamie, I think, it's a good question – obviously the $0.14 was not – well, there was a piece of it, 
probably that we would have collected during the year, but that $0.14 would have come over a long period of 
time, which we're now going to accelerate into FY 2016, and FY 2017. And then, we've got the headwind from oil 
and gas, and if you just do the math, you kind of get to something, if you are starting from the midpoint of the 
range, something higher than the midpoint of the range, but when you're trying to land a company of this size, at 
the end of year, having some contingency in there for other unexpected items, some of which are known to us now, 
some of which are not known is prudent from our perspective.”


AECOM reported $0.87c of Adjusted EPS in Q2’16 vs. Street estimates of $0.73c. Without the $0.14c curtailment 
benefit, AECOM would have simply matched estimates!

But Wait It Can Get Worse: AECOM Capital


AECOM set up AECOM Capital in 2013 as an investment vehicle to directly invest AECOM’s capital 


in public-private partnerships and private-sector real estate projects.  


AECOM gives very few details about these projects in its SEC filings, but as we will illustrate, would 


like investors to view investment sales as core earnings and cash flow. In our opinion, this is an 


aggressive financial presentation.  


• As stated in the Q2’16 Earnings Call, AECOM Capital is the financing arm of its fully integrated design build finance 
and operate strategy and has directly invested in 14 real estate projects since 2013 as a member/partner of joint 
venture arrangements with other independent third parties 


• AECOM Capital has committed nearly all of the $200 million of the first fund. Management has stated this investment 
has resulted in over $3.5 billion of total development value, including $1.5 billion of construction backlog executed by 
the Construction Services segment. AECOM’s website says the average investment size is $10 - $30 million 


• Initial investments centered on commercial, residential and mixed-use properties in major U.S. metros led by New 
York and Los Angeles 


• AECOM has stated that many of its investments are maturing, and going forward, earnings and cash flow from its 
portfolio of projects will be a more significant contributor to its financial results. AECOM is also pursuing several 
options to expand its capacity


• In 2015, AECOM reported the following as a line item in “Other Income”


“Our other income for the year ended September 30, 2015 increased $16.4 million to $19.1 million as compared to 
$2.7 million for the year ended September 30, 2014. The increase in other income for the year ended September 30, 
2015 was primarily due to the sale of an infrastructure fund investment.”


 Bear in mind, AECOM reports total asset of $13.8 billion, yet its capital commitment is $200m. Yet, on the next 
slide, we illustrate that AECOM wants investors' to view this as “core” earnings, and operating cash flows!

ACM Capital Viewed As Core Earnings and 
Going Through Operating Cash Flow


Chase A. Jacobson - William Blair & Co. LLC:    “First question, can you give any more color as it relates to the monetization of the AECOM 
Capital Investments? I know you're probably not going to give us a size. But how is that recorded? And as we go forward, are those going 
to be regular like every quarter, or is it going to be once or twice a year? Is there any color you can give there?


Michael S. Burke - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer: “Sure. We don't want to give guidance on a sub-segment level, but we – in those 
transactions, it will be difficult to project by quarter or even by year, but we fully expect that we will have a couple of monetizations per year 
for the foreseeable future. We have 14 individual investments that we are in process with right now within AECOM Capital. We have a much 
longer pipeline of potential investments beyond that. And so we will have monetizations this year. But given that we are in the midst of 
negotiating some of those monetizations, we don't want to get too specific on it, but it will be a regular part of our business going forward. 
The objective is to invest in these projects, deliver the design service and construction revenue along with it. And then when the project is 
complete, we want to recycle the capital and do it all over again. So it will be a regular part of business and it will be a part of our core 


earnings”


Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC:    Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask on free cash flow side of things. So, 
year-to-date, you're probably at around $160 million, which leaves if I use the midpoint of your guidance about $540 million for the 
second half of the year. Can you help us think through what might be coming through AECOM Capital, what might be coming through 
operating free cash flow, and how does it work with CapEx, which seems to be kind of ramping up towards the year-end as well?


W. Troy Rudd - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President: Hey, Jeff, this is Troy Rudd. I guess, first of all, we're right on track 
with where we expected to be in the first half of the year. If you look historically the business produces about 20% of its cash flow in the 
first half of the year and 80% in the back half of the year. This is a couple of data points. In the first half of the year, we spend a little more 
than $100 million on variable comp and some tax related to our equity programs that we don't have in the second half of the year. So 
that's the sort of the most significant item that influences the timing of the cash flow beyond what we see in just the normal run rate and 
earnings in our business. Our business does ramp up in the second half of the year and that also influences cash flow. So, where we sit 
today, we have great confidence in our ability to hit that full year guidance number.

In Our Opinion, Operating Cash Flow 
Is Inflated By Financed Receivables


AECOM sells accounts receivables in a financial arrangement to institutions. The company includes 


these asset sales as part of operating cash flow. In Spruce Point’s opinion, we do not view these 


arrangements as true operating cash flows, and are better viewed as financing cash flows, or as 


investment cash flows since they pertain to asset sales. As a best practices, many companies 


adjusted out financing receivables for presentation purposes (e.g. IBM)

ACM reported $108.9m of receivable sales in 2015. URS contributed $2,512m of receivables upon deal closing, 
while ACM’s receivable balance was $2,655m at 9/30/14. Thus, while ACM’s total receivables grew 94%, its 
receivable sales grew from $10.9m in 2014 to $108.9m in 2015, representing a ~900% increase!

In Our Opinion, Operating Cash Flow 
Also Inflated By Excess JV Dividends


We recently exposed Sabre Corp for inflating its operating cash flow by ~$15m by running JV dividends in 


excess of earnings as operating cash flows. Not surprisingly, Sabre recently cut its free cash flow estimate 


from $400m to $375m, but blamed higher capex needs! (1) Sabre’s CEO also abruptly resigned. (2) 


Accounting practices dictate that excess distribution above earnings should be viewed as returns of 


capital, and treated as investment cash flows (3). AECOM’s Cash Flow Statement clearly shows excess JV 


distributions running through operating cash flows.

In Our View, Free Cash Flow Also Inflated 
By Not Removing Noncontrolling Interest


AECOM’s cash flow should also be adjusted by removing net distributions to noncontrolling interests because Its 


operating cash flow starts with consolidated net income, and needs to remove the claims held by these interests. 


By normalizing AECOM’s free cash flow to remove financed receivables sales, excess JV dividends, and 


distributions to noncontrolling interests, we find substantial overstatement in AECOM’s Adj. Free Cash Flow.

Foreshadowing Problems: 
Interest Expense Rising Now?


With just 1 quarter left in its FY 2016, AECOM boosted its interest expense forecast by $15 million in Q3’16. Yet, 


both its outstanding floating debt exposure has declined and interest rates haven’t budged much. Bofa Prime Rate


and 3M Libor are up approx. 25bps.  AECOM said recently a 1% increase in rates would cause its interest expense 


to rise by $16m. Something is not adding up! AECOM’s credit agreement ties interest rate pricing to leverage – has 


it just signaled to investors that its deleveraging target won’t be met?


Sept 2015:    “For the year ended September 30, 2015, our weighted average floating rate borrowings were $3,001.9 million, or 
$2,476.9 million excluding borrowings with effective fixed interest rates due to interest rate swap agreements. If short term 
floating interest rates had increased or decreased by 0.125%, our interest expense for the year ended September 30, 2015 would 
have increased or decreased by $3.1 million. Our average effective interest rate on our total debt, including the effects of the 
interest rate swap agreements, during the year ended September 30, 2015 was 4.2%”


Dec 2015:   “For the three months ended December 31, 2015, our weighted average floating rate borrowings were $2,778.4 
million, or $2,178.4 million excluding borrowings with effective fixed interest rates due to interest rate swap agreements. If short 
term floating interest rates had increased or decreased by 0.125%, our interest expense for the three months ended 
December 31, 2015 would have increased or decreased by $0.7 million”


March 2016:  “For the six months ended March 31, 2016, our weighted average floating rate borrowings were $2,759.9 million, 
or $2,159.9 million excluding borrowings with effective fixed interest rates due to interest rate swap agreements. A 1.00% 
increase in such interest rates would increase total interest expense under our Credit Agreement for the six months ended 
March 31, 2016 by $10.8 million, including the effect of our interest rate swap”


June 2016:  “For the nine months ended June 30, 2016, our weighted average floating rate borrowings were $2,739.2 million, or 
$2,139.2 million excluding borrowings with effective fixed interest rates due to interest rate swap agreements. A 1.00% increase in 
such interest rates would increase total interest expense under our Credit Agreement for the nine months ended June 30, 2016 
by $16.0 million, including the effect of our interest rate swaps. Our average effective interest rate on our total debt, including the 
effects of the interest rate swap agreements, during the nine months ended June 30, 2016 and 2015 was 4.3% and 4.2%, 
respectively.”

Looming Goodwill and 
Intangible Asset Writedown? 


AECOM has to test its goodwill impairment on an annual basis, in this case by Sept 30th coinciding 


with the end of its fiscal year. 45% of assets are goodwill and intangibles. Based on management’s 


downbeat assessment this quarter, it should take a hard look at the valuation of these assets.

Material Weaknesses and Accounting 
Problems, But The CEO Still Gets Paid!


Spruce Point believes AECOM’s CEO compensation is excessive in relation to the poorly timed 


acquisition of URS, its newly disclosed accounting issues, and its overly aggressive accounting 


methods designed to portray AECOM in a better light than reality would dictate. Furthermore, we 


question the Board’s characterization of his performance as “extraordinary” and worthy of a $5m 


Performance Recognition Award.

CEO Highly Incentivized on 
“Adjusted” Free Cash Flow Metrics


AECOM’s CEO has an enormous incentive to present free cash flow in the most positive light given both his long 


and short-term bonuses are tied to this metric. As defined in the proxy, free cash flow does not adjust for factoring 


receivables, excess JV and noncontrollng interest distributions. 


It also gives credit for asset disposals through “net capital expenditures.”

AECOM presents the chart on the left to investors in its Proxy Statement showing a +52% increase in FCF per share,

adjusting for numerous accounting distortions, we find its FCF actually fell by 5%.

Valuation Opinion Isn’t Pretty

AECOM is Fully Valued; Limited Upside


Analysts are mixed on AECOM, but not as outright negative as they should be given the plethora of 


issues we’ve highlighted. We do not see a compelling risk/reward for being long AECOM at current prices 


and the market seems to agree given the average price target is $35.44 – implying little upside

Normalizing AECOM’s “Earnings”


Ascertaining AECOM’s true “earnings” is a difficult exercise given its multitude of accounting issues. 


In our opinion, AECOM’s 2016 Adj. EPS range of $3.00 - $3.40 per share cannot be taken seriously. We 


have normalized the results to adjust for aggressive adjustments.


Line Item To Bridge EPS Value Comment


AECOM’s 2016 GAAP EPS Range $0.91 - $1.31
A starting point, although even ACM 
acknowledges control weaknesses


Add: Amortization of Intangibles $1.35 ($0.92 after tax) 32% effective tax rate


Add:  Acq. and Integration Costs $1.28
ACM has made excessive addbacks 


already; we give no credit


Add: YTD Non-Core Operating Losses $0.17 Cannot pretend like they don’t exist


Add: YTD Loss on Disposal $0.27 ($0.18 after tax) 32% effective tax rate


Less: Pension Curtailment Gain ($0.14)
Questionable pull forward in Q2’16 


subject to uncertainty


Less: Reserve Reversal ($0.25)
Questionable margin liability reversal

Buyer Beware: If It Looks Cheap, 
There is Usually A Reason…


On inflated Wall St. estimates, AECOM is trading at just close to 11x P/E (which looks very cheap) and 8.7x 


EV/EBITDA (a modest premium to peers). However, on our adjusted figures it trades closer to 19x and 12.5x 


and is significantly leveraged! On Street estimates, Debt/EBITDA will be approximately 4.0x by year end. 


However, we haircut its EBITDA and include sizeable pension and operating lease obligations to estimate 


its true leverage at 7.4x. (1)


$ in millions, except per share figures


Wall St. research, Company financials, Bloomberg, and Spruce Point estimates 


(1) We adjust debt to include AECOM’s reported unfunded pension liabilities of $499m and operating leases of ~$1.4 billion as of 9/30/15. Street estimated 2016 EBITDA reduced by 


$200m of integration costs, $45m pension curtailment gain, $52m margin liability reversal, and $27m of non-core losses


(2) Defined as LTM operating cash flow – gross capital expenditures – Excess JV dividends above earnings – factored receivables - noncontrolling interest distributions

AECOM Leverage Covenant: 
No Room For Error


Leverage covenant becoming more restrictive at a time when AECOM can least afford it.


 AECOM’s recent 10-Q Gives its Current Leverage Ratio, But Remains Quiet on its Covenant Level


“Under the Credit Agreement, the Company is subject to a maximum consolidated leverage ratio and minimum interest 
coverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the quarter ended on March 31, 2015. The Company’s 
Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 4.3 at June 30, 2016. As of June 30, 2016, the Company was in compliance with the 
covenants of the Credit Agreement.”


 Warning: AECOM’s Leverage Ratio Covenant Becomes More Restrictive Sept 30th. It’s Dangerously Close To This 
Covenant At A Time When Its Financial Control Problems Are Becoming More Evident


Consolidated Leverage Ratio. Permit the Consolidated Leverage Ratio as of the end of any fiscal quarter of the Company 
set forth below to be greater than the ratio set forth below opposite such period, beginning with the First Test Date:
