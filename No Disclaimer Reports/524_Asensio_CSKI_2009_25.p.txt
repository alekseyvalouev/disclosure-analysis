CSKI’s New Admissions and Claims Raise More
Questions.


Posted on August 27, 2009 by Asensio.com


On August 26th, China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued


a press release addressing discrepancies between financial


statements filed with the China State Administration of Industry


and Commerce (“SAIC”) and statements filed with the U.S. Securities


and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). asensio.com first reported on


the discrepancies in a report issued on August 6th. Click here to


view the report.


CSKI’s press release admits that its SAIC filings are not consistent


with its SEC filings. The release states, “The Company [CSKI] has


determined these financial reports are materially different from the


financial reports filed with the SEC.” The statement that the


“Company has determined” is especially odd, given that the


discrepancy was revealed by an outside party, and that CSKI


management, based in China, should have been aware of the


discrepancy prior to an outside party reporting it.


A major issue from the asensio.com report left unaddressed by CSKI


is the small amount of revenue reported by CSKI’s suppliers and


customers, which CSKI has disclosed. These other companies’ SAIC-


filed financial statements are also much lower than the level of


revenues reported in CSKI’s SEC filings.


The previous asensio.com report mentioned that CSKI’s main


operating subsidiary, Harbin Tian Di Ren Medical Science and


Technology Co. (“TDR”) showed revenue of only about $1.3 million


and net income of only $1,000 in its SAIC-filed income statement for


2007, compared to the $49 million in revenue and $15 million in net


income reported in CSKI’s SEC-filed Form 10-K for 2007. Credit


reports show TDR’s 2008 figures to be equally inconsistent.
