Company 
Promotion / 


Situation 
Overview


Leading call center and customer 
engagement software provider


Leading provider of online 
educational services


Innovative robotics company 
capable of leveraging its success in 


robotics vacuums into other 
product categories such as 
telehealth, and lawn robots


Innovative technology disruptor in 
the third-party logistics space, 
hyping multiple iterations of its 
ETM and Optimizer technology, 
while quietly churning through 


five CTOs


Disruptive provider of social 
commerce solutions that help 


clients capture, display and 
analyze online word-of-mouth, 
including consumer-generated 


ratings and reviews


Our 
Criticism


Aggressive spending on low 
quality M&A obfuscates true 


organic growth. Run by a CEO who 
was investigated, and found to 
carry out aggressive business 


practices. Aggressive accounting 
and financial presentation of 


cloud sales. Shares up 45% YTD 
but have 60-70% downside risk


2U is a money-losing education 
technology provider. Its one size 


fits all model is being disrupted by 
fee-for-service players with lower 


take-rates. Our Freedom of 
Information Act (“FOIA”) 


documents offer compelling 
evidence that 2U’s long term 


guidance will disappoint investors 


Failures to innovate and repeated 
promises to diversify into other 
categories. Company is more a 


promotional vehicle for insiders to 
consistently sell stock at inflated 


multiples, while masking pressure 
through related distributor 


acquisitions 


Management has a history of 
associating itself with companies
that were touted as technology 
disruptors, but which ultimately 


fizzled out, and had minimal 
lasting endurance. Notably:  


Groupon and Innerworkings, both 
which had earnings restatements


Our research revealed that BV’s 
solution was nothing more than a 


money losing, rapidly 
commoditized service that would 
not scale. Its IPO prospectus was 
littered with social media buzz 


words at a time when Facebook 
was being taken public, and $25 


analyst price targets would prove 
unrealistic


Successful 
Outcome


Months following our criticism, 
Verint issued disappointing 
results, and its share price 


declined by 30%. Verint 
announced it would separate into 


two public companies, raise 
strategic capital, buyback stock 


and add two new directors


With shares trading over $90, we 
said the risk/reward was highly 


compelling for being short. Within 
a year, shares tumbled to as low 


as $12.80 after it became 
apparent that 2U’s debt fueled 
acquisition of Trilogy for $750m 


could not abate a significant 
tempering of its growth plans. 
2U’s CFO would also “retire”


iRobot’s home vacuum market 
share has been significantly 


eroded by new entrants, forcing 
significant price compression. Its 
telehealth robots have failed to 


deliver any upside, while it finally 
just launched a lawn mower 


vacuum in Feb 2019, yet has not 
been able to articulate the price or 
distribution strategy into the U.S. 


In Q2’17 ECHO cut its FY17 
revenue outlook and suspended 


longer-term guidance given 
changes in its end market and 


failure to hit synergy targets with 
Command. ECHO sell-side brokers 


downgraded their 
recommendations from Buy to 
Hold. ECHO’s shares fell to a 52 
week low of $13, or nearly 50%


BV’s CFO and CEO eventually 
resigned and its share price fizzled 


to low single digits before
ultimately being acquired for just 
$5.50/sh, 54% below its $12 IPO 


price and 70% below our initiation 
price


Spruce Point has a strong track record of exposing highly promoted “technology darlings” as technology dogs before the sell-side
and investors could figure out that the businesses had inflected negatively.

Executive Summary

Short DBX: Spruce Point Sees Approx 25% - 60% 
Downside To $6.60 - $13.00 Per Share


• Increasingly Low Value-Added Industry: In the decade since Dropbox was one of the first to market with retail cloud storage in the late 2000s, industry 
behemoths like Google, Microsoft, and Apple have begun to offer cheap or free storage plans as part of broader cloud software solutions, causing Dropbox’s paid 
user growth to begin to approach single-digit levels. Margin expansion – as high as 1,500 bps per year as recently as FY17 – has also skidded to a virtual halt. 
Dropbox is effectively a “pure play” company in an industry which is becoming increasingly commoditized to the point of near-zero returns at the extreme.


• Missing The Boat On The Remaining TAM: File storage and sync competitors such as Box, as well as other new entrants, are focusing their efforts on the 
enterprise vertical, where companies are increasingly looking to outsource file storage onto the cloud in a secure manner. Dropbox initially carved out its niche 
among retail and SMB users, and has failed to make similar inroads among large corporates. Industry experts tell us that Dropbox is virtually “nowhere to be 
seen” on the marketing trail in the enterprise vertical, as it does not meet many of the stringent compliance and cybersecurity needs of large businesses in 
heavily-regulated industries. The initial response to Dropbox’s new feature rollout appears to be “too little, too late” among these potential customers.


• Not-So-Sticky Customer Base Given A New Reason To Switch: In an attempt to appeal to the enterprise market – and to raise prices on existing customers –
Dropbox rolled out an entirely new platform (“Dropbox Spaces”) in Sept 2019. The customer response appears to be extremely negative, with users speaking out 
across forums to voice their displeasure with the price hike. Spruce Point’s proprietary customer survey reveals that half of Dropbox users – individual and 
business alike – do not believe that the new features justify the price hike, and that two thirds do not believe that it would be difficult to shift to a different cloud 
storage provider. Our survey results also indicate that the changes to Dropbox’s platform and pricing structure will result in accelerated churn in the near term, 
about which management is rarely transparent in its own right. Not surprisingly, key Dropbox executives are departing just as these changes take effect.


• Cash Flow Potential Misunderstood By A Significant Margin: We find that Dropbox, like most aggressive tech companies with poor business models which we’ve 
evaluated, tries to spin a rosy “Non-GAAP” measure of Free Cash Flow, suggesting 30% FCF margins. However, Dropbox depends heavily on capital lease spending 
– effectively deferred capex – that is growing faster than the market believes, yet which its proprietary FCF metric ignores. This capex, along with rising customer 
acquisition costs and heavy share repurchases to offset stock compensation programs, will cause Dropbox’s cash flow to fall significantly below expectations.


• Spruce Point Sees 25%-60% Downside Given Near-Term Headwinds And Cash Flow Adjustments: Analysts have largely maintained their lofty pre-IPO price 
targets on DBX, seeing 50%+ upside despite tangible evidence that the growth story is faltering. Bulls may think that its 3.8x NTM sales multiple is starting to 
“look cheap,” but this view ignores the declining quality of DBX revenue, tied to a fickle customer demonstrating rising churn, and to a service with a declining 
value proposition. We see a major reset coming as management’s levers to increase ARPU disappear, its TAM taps out, and more human capital departs in search 
of the next hot Silicon Valley growth story. As revenue challenges mount, we believe investors will focus more on the economics of Dropbox’s cash flow. While it 
currently trades at 105x our projected 2020 FCF, we believe that maturing “SaaS” plays with higher margins trade at 25x-50x, implying material downside risk.


Dropbox (“DBX” or “the Company”) was once seen – and is still seen by most investors – as the quintessential Silicon Valley software unicorn: a 
fast-growing, highly cash-generative SaaS company with a sticky customer base and a long runway for upsells. Spruce Point finds overwhelming 
evidence that the story has changed: Dropbox is a decelerating business in an increasingly low value-added space, with little network effects or 


barriers to entry. Meanwhile, management’s recent attempt to reaccelerate growth appears to be falling flat. We have collected unique data 
showing that its late FY19 decision to raise prices after creating a more “business-friendly” platform – dubbed the “New Dropbox” – has enraged 
some of its core individual/SMB user base,  and has given customers new reason to consider switching. Some investors take solace in Dropbox’s 
seemingly healthy cash flow, but Spruce Point believes that its FCF margin is misunderstood by the Street by as much as 2x. Dropbox is a melting 


ice cube, and management’s last-ditch turnaround attempt is poised to disappoint lofty analyst expectations. Spruce Point believes that its new 
normal of accelerated churn, increased capex, and rising customer acquisition costs will come to bear on results as soon as the next few quarters.

Bull vs. Bear Debate On Dropbox: 
Risk Is Slanted To 25% – 65% Downside


Topic What The Bulls Would Say Spruce Point Cold Reality


Registered Users
Ability to expand the Registered User count further 


through costless acquisition


Knowledge worker TAM almost saturated. Customer acquisition costs 
rising rapidly. Increasing signs of fractured relationship with Samsung, 


limiting distribution of the Dropbox app that started in 2013 


Conversion of Registered Users 
To Paid Users


Strong ability to accelerate the conversion of registered 
users into paying users


Evidence suggests otherwise. 
The conversion % has remained fairly stable


Ability To Grow ARPU / Churn
Customers will accept price increases if the offering is 
slightly tweaked to deliver incremental value. Dropbox 
not disclosing quarterly churn bc it’s stable in mid teens


Dropbox’s Community users illustrates the frustration of increasing 
prices + tech bugs on a rapidly commoditized offering. Churn will rise as 
users migrate to better (free) solutions. Our survey research results also 


suggest churn will be higher 


Headquarter Expansion
Designed to position Dropbox for future growth and 


create an environment to foster innovation
Poorly timed and expensive vanity project in a period where key human 


capital is fleeing the Company 


HelloSign Acquisition
$230m acquisition that can drive synergies, help 


penetrate enterprise, but won’t provide disclosures 
around performance in the future


Expensive deal at 14x revenues and $2,875 per customer that shows 
Dropbox has to pay up to enhance its service offering to remain 


relevant. Dropbox not competitive in enterprise


Free Cash Flow, Capex
Accounting And Financial 


Presentation Practices


Very conservative financial reporting and accounting 
practices. Strong 30% FCF margins and minimal capital 


expenditure requirements


FCF ignores capital lease repayments (deferred capex) + cash outlays to 
settle employee stock comp schemes. Margins closer to 8%. Aggressive 


amortization of sales commissions over 5yrs despite technology with 
zero useful life + attrition not fully disclosed. Capex needs increasing 


after pre-IPO investment, 3-5yr useful life, and rising complaints


“New Dropbox”
Will seamless reposition Dropbox into the new 


collaborate “smart workspace”
Repositioning will fail as it faces broader + greater competitive threats 


like Microsoft, Slack and others with a head start in the market


Committed Management And 
Shareholder Alignment


Founders have 55% voting control of the stock and 
recently added 500k shares in Nov 2019


Key executives have left recently including the two Chief Technology 
Officers and Chief Customer Officer. CEO joining Facebook Board 


suggests his time is not committed to fixing Dropbox


Sell-Side Price Target
Average street target of $26.92 offers >50% upside 


(street high target of $37.00)
Brokers will slash price targets once unachievable 15% sales growth and 


160bp margin expansion becomes evident in 2020


Spruce Point believes the bull case has been misguided ever since Dropbox’s highly promoted IPO, and that cracks are finally 
emerging everywhere in the story. Remaining bulls believe that the “New Dropbox”, a pivot into “smart workspace” will succeed. 


We provide compelling evidence it will fail, and see substantial risk potential.

Unicorn Or Stock Promotion And 
Potential Conflict-Ridden Dog?


Promoting The Unicorn…. Exposing The Dog


There was significant Pre-IPO hype generated by a $100m strategic investment and 
partnership made by Salesforce (CRM) In March 2018. Salesforce purchased 4.8m shares at 
the IPO price of $21 per share. 


The pre-IPO investment would later prove to have a well-timed benefit to CRM


Per the press release: “This deeper partnership with Salesforce is a great opportunity to 
build new value for our mutual customers,” said Quentin Clark, SVP of Engineering, Product 
and Design at Dropbox. “Salesforce has completely changed the way businesses connect 
with their customers through the use of cloud, social, mobile IoT and AI technologies,” said 
Dennis Woodside, Chief Operating Officer at Dropbox. “Together, we have the opportunity 
to fundamentally change how people work.”


“Dropbox's Patent Filings Could Hold Clues to Mystery Stock Surge… Much of the 
speculation has been focused on Salesforce”


The investment made in Dropbox was small relative to Salesforce’s size. Salesforce has made other Pre-IPO 
investments in companies of similar size (Zoom/Survey Monkey), and even invested in competitor Box years 
earlier. CRM CEO Benioff admitted he was a personal investor in Dropbox in 2012. Did CRM’s investment years 
later at a higher valuation, and ahead of its IPO, raise any potential conflict of interest concerns? (1)


CRM received a big accounting EPS benefit of $0.25c in Q1’18 following the post IPO rise in Dropbox. It reported 
Non-GAAP EPS of $0.74c vs. $0.46c estimated. (Source) However, the estimate beat would’ve been less 
pronounced absent the benefit. CRM’s stock rose 4% on the quarterly results (Source). CRM didn’t back-out the 
now GAAP compliant non-cash gain:  “The adoption of ASU 2016-01 resulted in unrealized gains, net related to our 
strategic investments of approximately $224 million during the three months ended April 30, 2018. This gain was 
primarily driven by initial public offerings of two strategic investments and unrealized gains related thereto of 
approximately $197 million during the three months ended April 30, 2018.”  Source: CRM 10-Q p. 44


Both COO Woodside (Aug 2018) and Quentin Clark (Oct 2019) have since resigned from Dropbox


According to Dropbox’s SEC filings at 12/31/18 the remining useful life of its developed technology is zero. In 
addition, Dropbox added 150 new patents since its IPO, yet its book value of patents has remained at $13m since 
2016. We have patent accounting concerns. Two Chief Technology Officers have left post-IPO 


With substantial pre-IPO hype, fueled by a potentially conflict-ridden investment by Salesforce, Dropbox’s IPO soared. But, as its 
growth slows, and business challenges intensify to transform itself, we believe Dropbox’s share price will continue to sink lower. 


“Dropbox's stock soared 14%, and were jumping another 9.5% to a new record high of 
$39.50 on Friday. Reasons for the surge are anyone's guess, but it's led to a frenzy of M&A 
chatter around the enterprise software company...Much of the speculation has been 
focused on Salesforce (CRM) - given the increasingly cozy relationship between the two 
companies.” Source: “Dropbox Patents Hold Clues”, TheStreet, June 2018

Is Dropbox’s CEO Focused On The 
Company Or Elsewhere?


Spruce Point has significant concerns with the recent news that Dropbox’s CEO Houston was recently appointed to the 
Board of Facebook. The media has dubbed the appointment by Facebook as “Zuckerberg’s Pal” and “Zuckerberg’s 


Friend”. According to Stanford Corporate Governance and Research Initiative, Board duties can be up to 20 hours per 
month.(1) We believe that CEO Houston, in a critical transformational period for the Company, should be committing all 


his time towards assuring that Dropbox succeeds. Furthermore, we are concerned that Facebook has a competing 
collaboration tool called Workplace from Facebook, and question what potential conflicts this presents?

Evidence of Growing Business 
Challenges In Core Markets
11


Core Problem: Free Storage Is A Money 
Losing Funnel To Larger Competitors


At the core, Dropbox was started as a medium to store and share documents. This is a money losing business that is 
being given away for free by much larger peers such as Google, Microsoft, and Apple with deeper pockets to subsidize 


customer acquisition costs, and more robust and broader integration into user’s personal and professional lives. 
Therefore, Dropbox’s challenge becomes findings ways to extend its value proposition. We believe it is now at the point 
where painting itself as the “New Dropbox” towards content collaboration will fail, and require expensive acquisitions.

In the early days, Dropbox users doubled from 200m to 400m in less than 2 years, and went from 400m to 500m in ~8 
months. It then took approximately 2.5 years for Dropbox to add 100m registered users from 500m to 600m. The 


Company doesn’t disclose customer acquisition costs, but consider that Dropbox spent $1.3 billion on sales and 
marketing expense (2016-YTD 2019) to attract 100m registered users. It’s estimated that only 2-3% of registered users 
convert to paying, thus costing it $440-$660 per paying customer. With an annual ARPU of $120, Dropbox has to hope 


customers will stay 3.5 – 5.5 years despite low switching costs and free alternatives. 


“Starting in 2016, we also took 
measures to manage the storage 
footprint of certain long-inactive 
Basic users, freeing up additional

closed the accounts of certain

Fractured Relationship With Samsung


Samsung sells over 1 billion mobile phones per year. In 2013, it struck a deal with Dropbox to include it in all its 
flagship phones. This greatly expanded Dropbox’s registered user potential. Fast forward to today, the partnership is 
being unwound. In October 2019, Dropbox notified users it no longer supports connections to Samsung My Files or 


Photo app. Not a single analyst has asked Dropbox about this on a conference call. Dropbox has little hope of 
expanding cell phone distribution further with other cell phone leaders like Apple.

As part of our research, Spruce Point spoke with a former Dropbox leader. When we asked him what he thought the 
biggest risk to the Company is, he offered some insights into the growth limitations. This was even echoed by the 


CEO early on.


“I think the biggest issue Dropbox faces as far as its growth story is concerned is the saturation.  If 
you think about the amount of “knowledge workers” that are out there globally, and these are 


people who would want to register for Dropbox, it’s probably 500 – 600 million. But of this 
amount, maybe 50% would even consider purchasing something from Dropbox. Thus, Dropbox is 
pretty close to, if not already, close to the saturation point in terms of registered users growth.”


Former Dropbox 
Leader


(paraphrased)


“We see ourselves as already having reached or registered a meaningful portion of the 
knowledge workers or our target audience, or knowledge workers on the planet, really.”

Slowing Paying Users And Poor 
Registered User Conversion


Spruce Point pays close attention to certain metrics, all of which bode negatively for Dropbox investors. We previously 
showed that Registered User growth has slowed, and in addition, Paying User growth is slowing in every single quarter. 
Furthermore, Dropbox has not demonstrated an ability to accelerate conversion of Registered Users to Paying Users in 


any meaningful way. The conversion ratio has remained stagnant in the 2.2% - 2.3% range for almost 4 years! ARPU 
growth has been recently supported by price increases, but given the commodity-like nature of its services, we do not 


believe that recent growth will be sustainable in the future.

Using data from Semrush, we find that “Free Cloud Storage” is the most popular search term used to drive traffic to

Churn Obfuscation


Spruce Point approaches Dropbox’s financial transparency with skepticism. Customer churn is a key metric to analyze 
a subscription software - yet Dropbox mentioned the word just once in its IPO prospectus – and refuses to report churn 
on an annual or quarterly basis. Dropbox has consistently claimed it’s been stable – and even improving – throughout 


all periods where it has increased prices, and its core offering has become more commoditized. 


“Our latest outlook incorporates some really positive early signals related to both conversion and 
churn that we're seeing. And the second thing I will say, we provided some color on churn back when 
we went public last year. Directionally, churn has been very stable for us since then. It did, in fact, 


improve across the business in Q2, so those rates have improved.”


Only 1 Mention of 
Word “Churn” In 


Dropbox’s S-1 
Prospectus


“And to your second question on color on churn in the quarter, we don't disclose churn on a regular 
basis. We did provide some color on gross retention rates as part of the IPO process. Churn for us 


has been stable and improving for many quarters and for a long period of time.”

Blowback From Price Hikes Evident


If churn is truly stable, or improving, it appears at odds with the fact that the “Most Liked Topics” in the Dropbox forum 
is customer complaints about price increases. This supports our belief that additional price hikes to bolster ARPU will 
be difficult to implement, and churn is likely to increase. The CFO’s recent comments call into question his credibility 


toward accurately depicting the affairs of the Company.

Spruce Point Survey: Insights Reveal Surprising 
Willingness To Switch From Dropbox


A key tenet of the Dropbox bull case is that Dropbox customers are purportedly sticky: because it can supposedly be challenging to 
port files from one platform to another, Dropbox’s customer base is likely relatively stable and willing to absorb marginal price 


hikes. However, our independent survey of Dropbox customers reveals that most users do not believe that it would be difficult to 
switch to another file sharing platform. With nearly half of all surveyed customers already using other file sync and sharing 


platforms in addition to Dropbox, Spruce Point believes that Dropbox customers are far more open to switching than the Street
currently believes.

- Ajay Vashee – Chief Financial Officer, Dropbox


Recent Changes To Dropbox Platform Could 
Be The Straw That Triggers Switching


Spruce Point believes that Dropbox users’ unexpectedly high propensity to switch poses significant and underappreciated near-
term risks to the Company’s continued growth. Just half of all Dropbox users surveyed by Spruce Point believe that Dropbox’s new


features justify its recent price increase. In fact, while Dropbox reports churn rates in the “mid-teens,” our survey suggests that 
close to 30% of users are either moderately or very likely to switch to a competing platform due to its recent price hikes.


With Dropbox users far more open to switching than the Street believes, and with recent price hikes now giving them good reason to seek out 
alternatives, Spruce Point believes that recent changes to Dropbox’s platform and pricing scheme could trigger accelerated churn in the coming 


quarters.


We believe that Dropbox’s top-line growth stands to disappoint as customers respond to Dropbox’s recent changes.

User Comments Show That Dropbox May 
Be Moving In The Wrong Direction


As Dropbox’s user growth decelerates as the business continues to mature, management appears to be aiming to generate continued top-line 
growth by raising prices alongside new feature roll-outs. However, customer feedback suggests that Dropbox’s core user base values Dropbox 
precisely for its simplicity and relative cost effectiveness, both of which are being sacrificed by management’s current strategy. Spruce Point 


believes that, as management attempts to support future growth by transforming Dropbox into a more premium product, it risks chasing away its 
core customer base, which values it primarily as a simple and low-cost storage option.


“Some features are nice but would come down to option of price.”


Spruce Point Survey: User Comments


“Dropbox, at first was a lot easier to use. It seems like a lot of these new things have 
really 'gummed-up' the smooth and easy way that Dropbox had.”


“Dropbox has improve some of the features in the software but the annual membership 
keeps going up at least 15 percent every year.”


“Needs to be cheaper.”


“I'm not sure how productive it is for the cost increase.”


“I like Dropbox but wish they wouldn’t raise prices so much.”


“Dropbox is convenient, but the price increase is challenging for my budget.”


“Dropbox is very expensive for high volume businesses.”


With Dropbox not yet suited to the more complicated needs of enterprise-level users, while at the same time neglecting the preferences of its core 
customer base, Spruce Point believes that management’s attempt to reinvigorate top-line growth could ultimately accelerate customer churn 


without winning over significant enterprise-level business.

Shifting Industry Priorities Favor Competitors 
Over Dropbox


As the role of enterprise cloud content management platforms has evolved through the past several years, businesses have increasingly 
prioritized features and services beyond simple file sync-and-sharing capabilities. This is reflected in the recent evolution of industry analyst 


reports. After 2017, Forrester ceased issuing reports on Enterprise File Sync and Share Platforms, instead combining it with its legacy Enterprise 
Content Management (ECM) report to create a new category in 2019: Cloud Content Platforms – Multitenant SaaS. With weaker offerings in the 


ECM space, Dropbox’s standing naturally declined in the new category. Similarly, in 2017, Gartner redefined its ECM category as “Content 
Services Platforms,” and soon thereafter stopped issuing its report on the narrower “Content Collaboration Platforms” vertical. While listed as a 


Content Collaboration leader in 2018, Dropbox was omitted entirely from the 2019 Content Services Platforms report.

Shift To M&A-Driven Growth Will Be Costly


Spruce Point believes that, as Dropbox’s organic growth in paying users slows, and as growth into the enterprise vertical becomes 
increasingly critical, the Company will be forced to turn to M&A for growth – both to increase its user base, and to add new 


enterprise-centric capabilities. Doing so, however, will come at a steep price, given prevailing valuations in the enterprise SaaS 
space. In Jan 2019, for example, Dropbox acquired the e-signature company HelloSign for $230M – 11.5x HelloSign’s CY18 revenue 


of $20M, over a turn above industry leader DocuSign’s (DOCU) 10.4x EV/Sales multiple at the time. This purchase price also 
amounted to a cost of $2,875 per customer for HelloSign’s 80,000 reported. Spruce Point believes that Dropbox will increasingly 


struggle to grow with scale as it turns to M&A.

What The Experts Have Told Us


Technology opinion leaders in respected magazines, along with experts we spoke to, believe that Dropbox has 
limitations and challenges in serving the Enterprise market.   


Source: PCMag, Nov 2019


“Dropbox does continue to struggle to attract true 
enterprise customers though, with very few reference 


customers who have gone all-in with the vendor, with its 
financials also pointing in this direction. 


Dropbox will always have its evangelists that enjoy using 
a familiar product, but it continues to be a tool that 


employees use, rather than an enterprise hub to be built 
around. It will hope that 'the new Dropbox' will start to 


change this. Box has more of a heritage catering to 
enterprise customer needs, both in its feature set and 


through its customer success team, meaning Dropbox is 
still playing catch up to an extent.”

Microsoft OneDrive for Business, which both offer quick

our Editors' Choice selections that have since ramped 


up file editing and real-time collaboration features from 
last time we reviewed them.”

“I service a lot more smaller/medium companies than enterprise. For the smaller sized companies I've done work for, almost all of them use 
Dropbox.  Box I would say is built more for the enterprise over Dropbox. Box has better security and feels more flexible around companies needs. 


Also I'd note that slowly I'm migrating more users off Dropbox onto Microsoft OneDrive, because it's included with your Office365 subscription.  It's 
all integrated with Windows and other Office apps.  Companies would rather cut the cost of Dropbox and use MS for free, once I show them it's the 


same thing essentially if they are already paying for it with their Office365 subscription.”

Pivot To “Smart Workspace” / 
Collaboration Likely Will Fail


Spruce Point believes Dropbox’s pivot and rebranding as the “New Dropbox” focused more on enterprise collaboration 
spaces is too little too late. Its core collaboration technology was acquired as Cove, and the founder became CTO. He left 
in 2018 as did his replacement in 2019. Dropbox faces stiff competition vs. Microsoft, Slack, Facebook and other players.

“The rumors are true! Dropbox has acquired stealth collaboration startup Cove for its talent, namely the brilliant

Facebook, where they lead product efforts from 2005 to 2010. Sanghvi, who oversaw the Facebook Platform and News Feed 
was first female engineer at Facebook.”


“It’s important for us to integrate deeply into a variety of different experiences, as we transition to Dropbox not being just 
an app on your phone. Our ambitions are much larger than file-sharing,” Houston emphasized.”

Key Executive Behind Push Into Enterprise 
Vertical Departs At A Critical Juncture


Since being promoted to Chief Customer Officer in Aug 2018, Yamini Rangan has been one of the leading executives behind Dropbox’s continued 
push into the enterprise space. At the Company’s recent analyst day, during which management announced the new Dropbox Spaces platform, it 


was Rangan who presented Dropbox’s go-to-market strategy among businesses and its plans to encourage enterprise adoption. We find it 
curious that, mere weeks after pitching the much-ballyhooed “new Dropbox” to investors as a top-flight business productivity platform with 
significant runway for growth, Rangan fled Dropbox for an identical role with HubSpot (NYSE: HUBS) in Dec 2019. If she was really confident 


about the platform’s growth potential, why would she leave even before having a chance to market the product?


“The majority of our registered user base as well as the majority of the total addressable 
market falls within work. We are a business software company, and that's where you'll 


see us continue to invest as we go forward in the smart workspace category.”


- Yamini Rangan – Chief Customer Officer, Dropbox


Yamini Promotes Enterprise Runway at DBX Analyst Day (Sep 25, 2019)


“As we enter the smart workspace category, we have a very large and addressable 
market that is focused on work. We are very uniquely differentiated as we think about 
every single layer of what a smart workspace needs to offer to our customers. We have 
a very good, unique go-to-market that is a combination of leveraging self-serve to land 


an account and leveraging a targeted outbound motion to expand within all of these 
accounts. And with the growth levers in place, we are well positioned for growth, and 


we have a pretty long runway.”

Chilling Insights From Employee Review


The allegations from a former Revenue Analyst at Dropbox are so specific, it’s hard to believe they aren’t true. Notably, 
data quality issues, broken systems, and key human capital defections will compound Dropbox’s transition plans.  


“So many cons, I don't know where to start.  When you interview they sell you the world, but soon after you join you realize just how bad of a decision you've made.


Data quality: there is none. I'm honestly shocked at just how bad it really is. No single source of truth for key company KPIs. Each team has their own datasets, their 
own numbers. Revenue analysts spend more time reconciling differences between numbers than doing real analytics work.


Systems: they're all broken, busting at the seams. Hive is down almost every day. Spend many hours wasted daily/weekly because of system reliability issues. Most 
datasets do not have a point of contact. Its the wild west when you're hunting down something you need.


Documentation: Bleak, virtually non-existent. Beyond a summary document for some key analyses, everyone just keeps their own docs to themselves. No universal 
store or repository of knowledge. Limited knowledge sharing.


A/B testing: extremely poor approach and methodology. No single process for all ICs to follow. No A/B testing tool/platform, everything is manual. Results are not 
scientific. Shocked at how a company this size operates this way. We don't truly understand the revenue impact of most initiatives. Estimations are not only okay, 
they are encouraged. Intense pressure from Growth leadership to share numbers at any cost to satisfy outlook adjustments. No true A/B testing culture or care for 
scientific approach to understanding product changes.


Morale/Culture: Growth team on a decline long before I started. Team often talks about leaving/regretting joining the Revenue Analytics team. The team was 25 
about a year ago, now we're just over 10. Resignations every month. Most of the management team in SF resigned, including senior management and director levels. 
ICs interviewing on a regular basis. Many good people already left.


Growth opportunity: limited opportunities for growth. Several low performing members on the team, their behavior is tolerated. Little motivation to do good work, 
the rewards are superficial. I haven't learned much here, if anything my career has slowed down.”

Like most aggressive tech companies with poor business models that Spruce Point evaluates, we find that Dropbox 
tries to spin a rosy “Non-GAAP” Free Cash Flow presentation. Various parties in the investment community have 


“bought-in” to management’s overly optimistic view.

Dropbox does warn that its Free Cash Flow excludes payments for finance leases and that it may be calculated 
differently from other companies in the industry, limiting its usefulness. When asked about finance leases, the CFO 


avoids highlighting the effect on the financial statements.

Non-GAAP Measures: Free Cash Flow


We define FCF as GAAP net cash provided by operating activities less capital expenditures. We believe that FCF is a liquidity measure and that it 
provides useful information regarding cash provided by operating activities and cash used for investments in property and equipment required to 
maintain and grow our business. FCF is presented for supplemental informational purposes only and should not be considered a substitute for 
financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. FCF has limitations as an analytical tool, and it should not be considered in isolation or 
as a substitute for analysis of other GAAP financial measures, such as net cash provided by operating activities. Some of the limitations of FCF 
are that FCF does not reflect our future contractual commitments, excludes investments made to acquire assets under finance leases, and may 
be calculated differently by other companies in our industry, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure.


Question, Justin Post:  “I know one of the initiatives of the Company is to move up to team sales. Just wondering how you are thinking about 
enterprise sales force and whether you might accelerate hiring there. And then on the CapEx versus the capital leases, maybe talk about 
why you choose to use capital leases, what are the advantages to the Company and how you think about the cash flow around those? 
Thank you.”


Answer, CFO Ajay Vashee: “This is Ajay. I'll jump in on the question on capital leases and thank you for the question. So the high level update 
there is that in the last quarter we added $25.5 million to our capital lease lines, and we made close to $30 million in payments against our capital 
lease obligations. And as a result, our ending capital lease balance was $170 million in Q1, and that was down about $4.3 million from Q4.


And at a high level, while there may be some variances within a given quarter and between quarters, we expect to generally maintain our 
outstanding capital lease balance over the long-term, as capital lease repayments will roughly offset capital lease additions.


And to your question on how we choose to buy equipment versus leverage a capital lease, we receive favorable financing terms on our capital 
leases. And we believe that for a portion of our infrastructure hardware, that they better match our capital investments with our cash inflows, and 
so that's why we leverage them. And we of course continue to evaluate our capital allocation strategy on an ongoing basis.”

Capital vs. Operating Lease Impact On 
Dropbox’s Financials


Financial Statement Operating Lease Finance Lease


Assets / Duration Headquarters, data center: ~11 years Infrastructure equipment assets: ~3 years 


Income Statement
Reported as rent expense, a cash item 


that reduces EBIT, EBITDA, EPS


Lease payments bifurcated between depreciation 
and interest expense, neither of which impact 


EBITDA. Reduces GAAP EPS


Cash Flow Statement
Reduces operating and 


free cash flow


Small portion runs through operating, but a 
majority of repayments flowing through the 
financing section of the cash flow statement, 


which overstates operating and free cash flow


Balance Sheet
Recorded on the balance sheet as 


“Operating Lease”


Infrastructure Assets recorded in PP&E, short and 
long-term liability on balance sheet as 


“Finance Lease Obligation”


Before we investigate Dropbox’s capital (finance) leasing use, we outline the effects of the choice on the key 
financial statements. Capital leases have the main effect of inflating EBITDA and Free Cash Flow, two key 


measures investors use to value Dropbox.

41


Lease To Own


Regardless of the lease being operating or finance, because of the short duration and useful life of the assets of 3 - 5 
years, Dropbox will essentially own the equipment. It’s payment are still capex related. 


“The Company leases certain equipment from various third parties, through equipment finance leases. These leases either include a 
bargain purchase option, a full transfer of ownership at the completion of the lease term, or the terms of the leases are at 
least 75 percent of the useful lives of the assets and are therefore classified as finance leases. These leases are capitalized in 
property and equipment and the related amortization of assets under finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization 
expense in the Company’s condensed consolidated statements of operations. Initial asset values and finance lease obligations are
based on the present value of future minimum lease payments.”

Limited useful life means DBX will 
have to re-invest in these assets every

Capital Lease = Deferred Capex


Capital leases are essentially deferred Capex arrangements that Dropbox would like investors to ignore. Similarly, 
capital used to offset employee compensation programs are operating in nature. These real cash costs are not being 


captured by financial data providers and quant models used to value the Company. 


Liquidity And Capital Resources:


“Since our inception, we have financed our operations primarily through equity issuances, cash generated from our operations, and 
capital leases to finance infrastructure-related assets in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. We enter into capital 
leases in part to better match the timing of payments for infrastructure-related assets with that of cash received from our 
paying users. In our business model, some of our registered users convert to paying users over time, and consequently there is a lag 
between initial investment in infrastructure assets and cash received from some of our users..”


Source: Bloomberg and Dropbox
43


Is A Major Capex Cycle Coming?


It’s convenient that Dropbox was talking about minimal need for incremental capex leading up to the IPO in 2018. 
Given the 3-5 year life cycle, we would expect capex to rise materially in 2020/21.


Infrastructure Optimization


“In recent years, we have taken several steps to improve the efficiency of the infrastructure that supports our platform. These efforts include an 
initiative that focused on migrating the vast majority of user data stored on the infrastructure of third-party service providers to our own lower cost, 
custom-built infrastructure in co-location facilities that we directly lease and operate. In order to host user data on our own infrastructure, we leased 
or purchased infrastructure that is depreciated within our cost of revenue. During the migration to our internal infrastructure, we duplicated our users’ 
data between our internal infrastructure and that of our third-party service providers, resulting in higher storage costs. We reduced this practice over 
time until we completed the migration in the fourth quarter of 2016. Related to this initiative, we no longer duplicate data between our internal 
infrastructure and that of any third-party service providers. We expect to continue to realize benefits from expanding our internal infrastructure due to 
our operating scale and lower unit costs.


Throughout 2016, we also took measures to manage the storage footprint of certain long-inactive Basic users, freeing up additional storage capacity. 
This effort, along with additional usage optimizations, enabled us to continue operating our business within our existing infrastructure 
base without a need for extensive incremental capital expenditures and leasing activity.”

“We continue to expect additions to capital lease lines to be high single digits as a percentage of revenue going forward.”

Heavy Stock Compensation Is Not 
Without Cash Impact 


We believe investors should pay greater attention to Dropbox’s stock based compensation (SBC) expense because it 
is not a “cashless” cost to investors. Its SBC per employee is nearly twice as large as peers. In order to manage tax 


withholding payments for employee restricted stock programs, Dropbox uses significant capital labelled as a 
“financing” cash flow, when in reality it is a form of compensation expense (i.e. an operating cash flow).

Spruce Point believes that Dropbox overstates free cash flow with a simplistic presentation that is analytically flawed 
and ignores two material costs such as: 1) Costs required to repurchase shares related to employee compensation 


programs, which are operating in nature, and 2) Costs associated to pay for infrastructure, which are effectively 
deferred capital expenditure payments. Both of these items are flowing through the financing section of the cash flow 


statement, but should be viewed as operational in nature.

Close Competitor Correctly Removes 
Capital Leases


The fact that Box properly removes capital lease obligations from its definition of free cash flow further supports our 
argument that Dropbox uses a flawed, and aggressive way to measure its business. 


Source: BOX Fiscal Year Results


Free Cash Flow:


“Box defines free cash flow as cash flows from operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, principal payments of 
capital lease obligations, capitalized internal-use software costs, and other items that did not or are not expected to require 
cash settlement and that management considers to be outside of Box’s core business.”

Evidence of Inflated Earnings Too


Dropbox amortizes sales commission costs over an associated benefit period of five years, the length of which it claims 
to calculate on the basis of “historical customer attrition rates, the useful life of our technology, and the impact of 


competition in our industry.” Management, however, bills customers only monthly or annually – and, compared to Box, 
an outsized share of its customers are retail or small business clients on shorter-term contracts. Meanwhile, 


management does not disclose customer attrition rates – and, in its 2018, 10-K, estimated the useful life of its remaining 
developed technology at zero years. Spruce Point believes that a five-year amortization period for sales commissions is 


overly-aggressive for a company whose customers can exit their contracts either monthly or annually, and whose 
developed technology has no remaining useful life.

Pro Forma Adjusted Earnings


Spruce Point believes that, given the nature of Dropbox’s contracts, customer base, and lack of developed technology, 
commission costs represent customer acquisition costs which should be recognized upfront. By recognizing these 
costs upfront, rather than amortizing them over a lengthy and liberally-determined 5 year span, Dropbox would have 


seen operating income fall by anywhere between 5% and 21% in each quarter dating back to Q2 2017.

Book Value Potentially Over-Stated From 
Missing Cash Liability


We believe Dropbox should have been conservative and accrued a $48.5m liability for cash contractual agreements 
for future payments related to the HelloSign acquisition. As a result, we believe its book value is overstated.


“On February 8, 2019, the Company acquired all outstanding stock of JN Projects, Inc. (d/b/a HelloSign) ("HelloSign"), which provides an e-signature 
and document workflow platform…...In addition to the total purchase consideration above, the Company has compensation agreements with key 
HelloSign personnel consisting of $48.5 million in future cash payments subject to on-going employee service. The related expense will 
be recognized within research and development expenses over the required service period of three years, and the payments will begin in 
the first quarter of 2020 if the requisite service is provided.”


Accrued compensation fell in Q1 2019, and 
Dropbox did not provide any quantitative discussion 
regarding the factors why. We believe it may have 


been related to bonus payments made to 
employees. Yet, it does not appear that any of the 
$48.5m of future cash compensation requirements 


increased this account

Patent Value Hype, And Accounting 
Problems


In our opinion, bulls incorrectly think there is value in Dropbox’s patents.(1) On the surface, the Company claims 750 
patents issued (up from 600 at pre-IPO), with an additional 600 pending patent applications (a suspiciously identical 


amount 19 months later). Yet, Spruce Point finds it baffling that the book vale of Dropbox’s patents has not changed at 
all from $13.0m since first filing financial statements referencing FY 2016. This may suggest that Dropbox both spends 


nothing to develop or protect patents, nor does it amortize the remaining patent useful life through earnings. 


“We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of patents, patent licenses, trade secrets, domain name 
protections, trademarks, and copyright laws, as well as confidentiality and license agreements with our employees, 
consultants, and third parties, to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. In the United States and 


abroad, we have over 750 issued patents and more than 600 pending patent applications.”

and would be an unusually large deal, for technology-focused private equity.(1) Potential buyers are likely to wait for its

As a result, we see above average risk that Dropbox misses its revenue and cash flow objectives.

Dropbox Valuation Higher Than It Looks


On face value, some may view Dropbox as a “cheap” SaaS tech play based on a multiple of revenues. However, 
investors fail to appreciate Dropbox’s revenues are of poor quality, largely tied to retail and small business customers 


that have stable churn (which we believe will rise), and ARPU growth (which we believe will slow) that will generate 
lofty 15% sales growth. We believe these targets are at severe risk of not materializing. As investors come to grips with 


Dropbox’s maturity, investors will start to focus on its free cash flow. However, we believe increased customer 
acquisition costs and capital spending will pressure free cash flow. Dropbox appears very rich on free cash flow basis.

As Dropbox matures, we believe investors will 
increasingly focus on cash flow over revenue. Sell side 


analysts don’t appreciate that Dropbox’s free cash 
flow is substantially lower than advertised after 


adjusting for both cash costs related to employee 
stock programs and finance leases. Given rising costs 


related to Dropbox’s transition and sales and 
marketing needs, we believe cash flow will contract. 


Carbonite was recently acquired for 20x Adj Free 
Cash Flow and growing substantially faster than 


Dropbox. Even giving Dropbox a generous multiple at 
50x still suggest nearly 25% downside risk.

Sell side analysts use a simplistic multiple of revenue 
in relation to the growth rate to value a SaaS 


company. However, not all revenue is of equal 
quality. Furthermore, we believe Dropbox’s revenue 


will decelerate faster than the market believes as 
churn increases, from pricing pressures and better 
competitive offerings. Box, with a better enterprise 


customer base, currently trades at 3.3x. We see 
Dropbox’s revenue growth rate converging towards 


Box’s rate, and think it should trade at a discount


$ in millions, except per share amounts


At the end of the day, cash is king, and the market misevaluates Dropbox’s true free cash flow. We expect cash flow to 
come under greater pressure as customer churn and acquisition costs rise. In addition, there is significant evidence from 


customer and insider complaints that Dropbox’s technology is behind the curve. We expect capex and development needs 
to increase, and drag down free cash flow potential.

Appendix: Spruce Point Survey


Spruce Point commissioned an independent survey of Dropbox users to gauge the customer response to Dropbox’s 
recent price increases and feature releases. Respondents were recruited through a third-party platform and given a small 


incentive to participate in the survey. The key results are presented in this presentation. Of the 351 responses which 
were completed in a timely manner, 30% were individual users, 35% were business users at enterprise-level corporations, 
and 38% were SMB users. The aggregate results shown in this report are nearly identical across each of these three sub-
populations, and are therefore shown at the aggregate level for ease of presentation. Attrition was less than 2% among 


these 351 respondents.
