Who is Ashwood Resources? And who owns
ashwoodresources.com?
Northern Oil and Gas (NOG:AMEX) and its sister company Voyager Oil and Gas (VOG) are a minor
obsession of mine. 
 
Not only are the management straight from central casting but Northern Oil sold interests in
approximately 90 wells (a quarter of the wells they were ever involved in) to a mysterious company
called Ashwood Resources. 
 
Ashwood it appears has no other function that to buy properties from Northern Oil and to manage
those properties. 
 
So it was a surprise to me and to others when Brittany Reger - wife of Northern Oil CEO Michael
Reger - was the contact officer for Ashwood Resources. 
 
Can you say conflict of interest? 
 
Anyway Michael Reger offered two defenses. First whilst the lease interests sold to Ashwood were
numerous they were tiny - sometimes as small as half a percent interest in individual wells. The
second defense was that Ashwood was not a related party and his wife's job was appropriate. He
even said the company sought the advice of outside counsel on that matter. 
 
Ashwood may have been founded by a hairdresser - but was - it seems - controlled by Jacob Schaffer
- a realtor in Minneapolis. It was not - according to Michael Reger - related in any way (other than by
his wife's employment) to Northern Oil or the Reger family. 
 
Which leads me to the website www.ashwoodresources.com. The site is dead - but the registration
lives on. 
 
When I first started looking at Northern Oil here were the registration details for Ashwood:

I find Americans sometimes do not get
a British or Australian sense of humor.
 
If something on this blog makes you
really angry I suggest you read Swift's

5/19/2018 Bronte Capital: Who is Ashwood Resources? And who owns ashwoodresources.com?


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2011/06/who-is-ashwood-resources-and-who-owns.html 2/6


Billings Montana is 840 miles from Minneapolis and from the Realtor who owns
Ashwood. But strangely enough it is the Reger's home town.
 
Coincidence? Maybe.
 
Then a few weeks ago the registration for the domain name changed.

Tyler Cross - the original contact on the registration for Ashwood Resources almost certainly knows
who the underlying owner of Ashwood is. I have tried contacting him. 
 
I got no response.
 
Anyone got any other ideas for getting to the bottom of this? 
 
Help requested.
