Executive Summary

Spruce Point Estimates 75% – 85% Downside Risk 
For Monolithic Power (Nasdaq: MPWR)


Spruce Point has significant concerns about Monolithic Power Systems (Nasdaq: MPWR), a designer and manufacturer of power management 
solutions. Despite being headquartered and publicly listed in the U.S., MPWR operates largely as a foreign company with ~90% of its production, 
and 58% of sales reported in China. After a close on-the-ground and forensic financial investigation, Spruce Point finds evidence that suggests 


$245 - $265m (~40%) of its sales are irreconcilable.  With MPWR’s shares valued among the highest in the semiconductor space, and fundamental 
and accounting pressures mounting, we see the potential for 75% – 85% downside risk  ($21 – $35 per share).

Signs of 
Irreconcilable 


Revenue
And 


Bloated 
Inventory 


Too Many Red Flags To Ignore At Monolithic Power Based On Our Evaluation
 Accounting Weaknesses Since IPO: As a backdrop to our investigation, it’s noteworthy that MPWR cited two material weaknesses at its IPO. 


Though claiming the issues were resolved, MPWR later issued a non-reliance opinion on its financials in 2008 related to tax accounting 
 Key Disclosures At IPO Have Vanished: MPWR used to disclose backlog, distributors, end customers, and manufacturing partners, but has 


ceased all of these disclosures. It remains heavily dependent on distributors, which is a notorious way companies can manipulate results
 China Tax Filings Show ~$262M Missing Revenue And Almost No Inventory: MPWR claimed $335m of China revenues (58% of total) in 


2018. MPWR’s Chinese tax filings for its three subsidiaries show $73m. China gross margins are 36.0% vs. 55.6% consolidated. Importantly, 
MPWR reported holding almost no inventory in China at year end 2017/18 despite significant production and end customers there


 Days Inventory Exploding, A Red Flag That Foreshadowed Two Past Semiconductor Accounting Scandals; Vitesse Semi and Sipex Corp: 
MPWR’s days inventory outstanding are currently 180, and have grown consistently over the past few years while most semi peers have been 
stable. Based on our analysis, the long-term industry average is 106 days. If we assume $245 - $265m and $93m of potential revenue and 
inventory overstatement, respectively, MPWR’s pro forma inventory metrics fall exactly in-line with peers. A former MPWR audit member 
concealed his connection to the scandal at Sipex Corp, which restated revenues lower by 35% and slashed gross margins by 1,590bps


 A Former Employee Told Us He Left MPWR Recently Due To Ethical Concerns And Having Seen Inventory Manipulation: “...if they need to hit 
a number to show a sale, they will force the distributor ..They’ll make a deal. They'll cut a deal with the distributor and they'll convert that 
inventory to distributor owned inventory to show that they met their numbers for the quarter”


 MPWR’s Connection To Super Micro (SMCI): Super Micro is currently delisted and investigating revenue recognition problems. Two of SMCI’s 
current Directors have links back to MPWR. In addition, MPWR and SMCI shared the exact same audit engagement partner at Deloitte


 MPWR Just Dismissed Deloitte As Auditor: Deloitte was auditor of record since 1999. E&Y was appointed in March 2019. We observe that 
Deloitte started to audit MPWR’s China business more carefully since 2017, as indicated by PCAOB Form APs, before being dismissed


Last CFO 
Left Under 
Suspicious 


Circumstances


Current CFO 
Potentially 


Misrepresenting 
Himself


Spruce Point Attempted To Speak With Former CFO Meera Rao, But She Declined An Invitation To Speak 
 MPWR Has Been Dodgy About Disclosing Product Average Selling Prices (ASPs): Despite >70% historically, and now >90% of product sales 


reported as DC to DC converters, MPWR has claimed it cannot provide color on ASP trends. However, as noted in its Risk Factors, and 
consistent with the semi industry, prices tend to decline over time. Yet, the CEO once claimed that ASPs have been stable throughout time


 Former CFO Rao Claimed ASPs and Margins Don’t Go Up With New Products: Rao made this statement in January 2016. Less than a month 
later, she abruptly resigned. Post an SEC comment letter in 2014 asking for price drivers to revenue, MPWR revealed that from 2013-2016, 
prices declined on average by 5% per year


 ASPs Soar Post Rao’s Resignation: CEO Hsing started touting “killer products” that “are ahead of everyone else” citing technologies we 
cannot identify with simple Google searches. In 2017-2018, prices miraculously increased 12% and 4%, respectively, the largest on record


 Bernie Blegen Succeeds Rao as CFO: Upon his appointment, long-time director Karen Smith also resigned. Blegen represents himself on his 
biography as a CPA. However, this is potentially misleading since a background check reveals his CPA license was cancelled in 1985

Spruce Point Estimates 75% – 85% Downside Risk


There Are Some Obvious And Some Subtle Near-Term Signs of Financial Strain Occurring At MPWR
 Read Through From Taiwan’s Pegatron: We believe Pegatron is responsible for manufacturing and assembly of Microsoft’s Xbox and 


Surface products. Recent commentary in May 2019 from Pegatron points to -6.8% and -4.6% decline in growth of these products in the next 
few years which bodes negatively for MPWR


 Auto Industry: MPWR’s early success in autos appears to be rapidly fading. Revenues started ramping in 2014-15, and per the CEO, the 
design cycle is 3-4 yrs. We believe MPWR’s auto sales are peaking, and have mostly penetrated low end auto applications such as 
windshield wipers. Despite MPWR talking sustainable 40%-50% revenue CAGR, actual results are decelerating fast in H1 2019


 China Distributor Interviews Point To Weakness: For 2019, industry distributors were uniformly negative, with half saying sales will be flat or 
grow a little. In mid September, SMTC Corp, a publicly traded electronics manufacturing services (EMS) company warned of softness in 
China: Specifically, growth weakness was reported in key MPWR end markets of semiconductors and cloud storage


 Inventory Raw Material Growth Now In Decline: Per MPWR’s disclosures, it builds inventory in advance of expected demand for its products. 
As a result, raw material inventory growth should be a leading indicator for future performance. We find that raw materials to total inventory 
peaked in Q4 2018. Raw material growth is slowing, and turned negative in Q2 2019, while inventory charges are rising rapidly


 Warranty Costs Exploding: Post IPO, warranty periods have generally risen from 90 days, and are now up to 2 years. In 2018, warranty 
costs exploded from $1.8 to $6.4m. MPWR recently removed the statement that warranty expenses have historically not been material


 Supplier Termination: In Dec 2018, a supplier terminated a prepaid wafer purchase agreement and would refund $4.3m. We believe wafer 
agreements take a long time to get qualified, and expect this could cause a medium term headwind 


 Extended Accounts Receivable Payment Terms A Bad Harbinger: MPWR has had unusual divergences in accounts receivable and sales 
growth, and recently disclosed extended payment terms. The last period this occurred was early 2010; the share price declined by >60%


 Land Flipping: MPWR flipped a piece of land in Washington state for a $2.4m gain which it will book in Q3 2019 to improve earnings


Imminent Signs 
of Financial 


Strain Point To 
Looming 


Disappointment 


Remarkable Ability To Provide Narrow Guidance, And Hit Numbers In The Notoriously Cyclical Semi Industry
 Exposure To Cyclical End Markets: Consumer, industrial and automotive end markets account for >60% of sales
 Guidance vs. Peers: In the past 4 quarters, MPWR’s quarterly sales guidance has been within 2% of its midpoint and its gross margin 


guidance range is 0.70%. This range of guidance is suspiciously narrow relative to peers despite above avg. cyclical end market exposure
 Rarely Misses Quarterly Results: According to Bloomberg, MPWR has missed only 1 quarterly Adj EPS estimate since 2008, by only a 


fraction of a cent. Only one quarterly sales estimate and one sales guide was modestly light in Q4 2018 during escalating trade wars
 Long-Term Average Quarterly Gross Margin Deviation To Estimates Is Zero: After analyzing MPWR’s quarterly gross margin and gross 


margin guidance, we find minimal standard deviation. We can’t find any MPWR peers capable of producing these results. Either MPWR has 
a superior ability to manage its business in a cyclical industry, or its numbers are being reported in a way as to never miss analyst estimates


 Inventories Are A Key Component In Reporting Gross Margins: Recall that days inventory consistently increase, and MPWR’s China tax 
filings reported negligible inventory balances. Inventory inflation could be consistent with stuffing costs to keep margins stable or evidence of 
distributor and channel pressure intensifying, cited by a former employee

Spruce Point Estimates 75% – 85% Downside Risk


Remaining 
Insiders Have 


Little Left At Risk


Governance Not A High Priority According To Our Research. Key Board Members Linked To Controversial Companies 
 Founding Shareholder and Board Member Chang Kuo Wei (Herbert) Chang: MPWR’s largest shareholder at IPO, Herbert rapidly cashed out 


but remains on the Board. His involvement with prior public companies, including Oplink Communications, BCD Semiconductor and Marvell 
Technology all merit significant scrutiny. Chang entities and associates have been linked to offshore companies in the Panama Papers


 Audit Member Douglas McBurnie: Served on MPWR’s Board 2007-2014, and failed to disclose in his biography that he was Chairman of 
Sipex Corp, a California based semiconductor company. As noted earlier, Sipex restated revenues 35% lower from aggressive revenue 
recognition accounting choices, and gross margin was revised from -8.9% to -24.8%, or 1,590bps lower


 First Audit Chair Alan Earhart left under questionable circumstances: According to a former executive we spoke to: “Michael (CEO) doesn't 
like people asking questions he doesn't like. And Alan was doing his job as audit chairman and sort of rocked the boat too much.”


 Victor K Lee: Alan was replaced as Audit Chair in 2009 by Victor K. Lee. Lee also served as CFO of Leadis Technology, a fabless 
semiconductor company that failed and was delisted. The Company settled a shareholder lawsuit, without admitting, that it misled investors


Multiple 
Directors Linked 
To Various Other 


Corporate 
Accounting 


Scandals And 
Business 
Failures


Rapidly Deteriorating Alignment Between Management And Shareholders
 As A Whole Insiders Own Practically No Shares: In total, insiders own just 3% (CEO Hsing 1%). At IPO, all insiders owned 37.5%
 Recent Share Price Explosion And Double Digit Revenue Growth Expansion Linked To New Long-Term Compensation Program In 2013: 


Some of these long-term grants begin vesting in 2018. When we asked a former executive his opinion on MPWR’s recent success and ability 
to sustain double digit revenue growth he said, “That has surprised me. I would've bought more stock if I knew that. Yeah, because back in 
the day when I was doing that, you couldn't get that kind of revenue (growth).” 


 No Clawback For Fraud Associated With The Long-Term Comp Program: By reading the fine print, we see that MPWR’s clawback policy 
does not apply to ill-gotten gains associated with the long-term compensation program. The clawback only applies to short-term incentives

Foundation


Geographic Revenue Reporting Potentially Misleading, Enabling MPWR To Lower Taxes And Understate Customer Risks
 MPWR Is More Foreign Than U.S. Based: Since coming public in 2004, MPWR has reported cumulative U.S. sales of just $101m, or 3% of 


total, and pre-tax losses from the U.S. of -$33.2m. 
 MPWR Uses A Bermuda Structure To Route Sales For Tax Deductions: Disclosures point to a significant amount of its cash flowing through 


its Bermuda subsidiary, which owns its Singapore subsidiary. In our view, both subsidiaries are very material subsidiaries. Yet, we do not 
believe either is adequately being audited. In fact, the Singapore subsidiary currently has a going concern warning, and is audited by a three 
person audit firm called Plus LLP, and not Deloitte its auditor of record for 2018


 Geographic Reporting Could Be Misleading: MPWR’s 2018 10-K claims just $17m of U.S. revenue based on customers “ship-to locations”. 
However, Spruce Point believes this does not provide a clear view as to where customer concentration and risks lie. Based on our research, 
we believe that U.S. based Microsoft accounts for ~$100m of sales (>17%) through consumer products such as Xbox and Surface tablets. 
Revenues have grown rapidly from $11m in 2017, and we believe, will provide a major headwind to sales comps 


 In Q2’19, A “Direct” Customer Accounted For 16% of Receivables: In our opinion, this is a material amount, and supports our view that 
MPWR must disclose the identity of customer labelled “Company A (direct)” to provide greater transparency


 Fragile MSFT Relationship: Based on disparaging public comments made by CEO Hsing directed at the “gaming” industry, MPWR does not 
appear to respect the Microsoft relationship, and could stand to lose the business over time as Microsoft looks to diversify suppliers


 Losing Vast Consumer Revenue (ex: Microsoft): Excluding rapid revenue growth contribution from Microsoft between 2017-2018, we 
estimate other consumer revenue has fallen off a cliff and was down -53%. Overall consumer revenue is down -8.8% YoY in Q2 2019

Strategies 
Suspicious 
In Context


Spruce Point Estimates 75% – 85% Downside Risk


Most Companies In This Env’t Prefer Cheap Debt For Acquisitions And Buybacks, Yet MPWR Is Buying Unlevered Real Estate
 Vast Amounts of Excess Cash: MPWR is sitting on $369m of cash and securities (66% at foreign subsidiaries) and has no debt. Why is its 


balance sheet being so under-managed?
 Growing Dividend, But Well Below Potential: Bulls praise MPWR’s recent dividend initiation in 2014 and subsequent increases, but it is well 


below potential. Stated earnings are up 400% in the same period the dividend is up 166%. The payout ratio is down from 98% in 2015 to 42% 
based on this year’s projected earnings 


 Last Share Buyback In 2015, Well Timed: MPWR’s $32m buyback in 2015 coincided with CEO Hsing’s largest stock sale since coming 
public. Hsing’s ownership fell from 5.0% to 1.6% during this time period


 Only Acquisition Was Tiny And Appears To Have Failed: In 2014, MPWR bought Swiss Sensima Technology for $11m and an earnout up to 
$8.9m contingent on certain product revenue and margin targets. The earnout was reversed within 18 months suggesting failure to hit targets


 $126M Spent On Real Estate, Notably A Large Recent Office Purchase At A 35% Premium: Beyond dividends, MPWR has a voracious 
appetite for real estate. Of particular concern, it abandoned a land acquisition and 50,000 sqft HQ development project in favor of an even 
larger 75,000 sqft commercial office building in Kirkland, WA this year. The local media called the 35% premium paid by MPWR “insane” 
given that the prior owner purchased the property just 9 months earlier, and made no capital improvements. According to a local broker, 
MPWR will occupy “only a small portion” of the building. The $53m purchase was funded by cash repatriated from Bermuda, a notoriously 
opaque financial center. MPWR paid $707/sqft when it its average rent expense is just $16/sqft (44x buy vs. rent)


 Highest Square Footage Per Employee In The Industry: MPWR’s 381 sqft per employee is the highest among peers, and well above the 
industry average at 312. With so much real estate square footage, and no disclosures of employees by region / function, or margins by 
product / region, MPWR can allocate overhead in a way that it deems best to flatter its margins


Analysts Are Unanimously Bullish And See 16% Upside To An Average Price Target of $165. MPWR’s Excessive Embedded 
Takeout Premium Is Wildly Optimistic 
 MPWR is covered by 7 brokers, with the most bullish ones having no China presence, but seeing upwards of $182 per share
 Analysts project that MPWR will return to 19% and 27% sales and EPS growth in 2020, but we believe this is unrealistic as MPWR’s


engineering and technology edge has slowly been eroded, and margin challenges in China becomes more evident 
 MPWR will start lapsing a substantial ramp in revenues booked in 2017-18 from Microsoft, a client it appears to have a rocky relationship 


with. Slowing raw material growth, a surge in warranty expense, and extended customer payment terms are negative indicators
 Analysts also take MPWR’s results at face value, and we don’t believe they’ve consider the fact that ~$260m of revenues cannot be 


reconciled in its China tax filings, and de minimis inventory was reported. At worst, this explains potential phantom sales and inventory which 
continues to balloon, and allows gross margins to appear stable and growing in the notoriously volatile semiconductor industry 


 Trading at a substantial premium to semiconductor peers at 10x, 37x, and 37x 2019E Sales, EBITDA, and P/E, MPWR’s share price
incorporates an unfounded belief it is a best-of-breed takeover target. Yet, industry takeout multiples are closer to 3.3x, 17.5x, 39x. Based on 
our conversations with people familiar with MPWR, we believe its “cowboy” culture is not a good cultural fit with traditional more conservative 
industry players. As such, we see little chance a takeover ever materializes


 Based on our belief that MPWR’s Chinese tax filings are a credible indicator of potential financial misstatement, we see 75% - 85% downside

Through a Chinese attorneys, we obtained tax filings for MPWR’s three Chinese subsidiaries.(1) Assuming no inter-
company sales, the three subsidiaries together reported ~$73m in gross revenues and 35.9% gross margin in 2018:  


78% lower sales and gross margins 1,970bps lower. Despite our estimate that 90% of production occurs in China, the 
Chinese entities reported almost no inventory. Where is the $100-$136m of year end inventory reported at the

MPWR Bull Case Misperception vs. Spruce Point 
Investigative Reality


Our view diverges wildly from the Street’s view based on a close forensic investigation, and not taking management’s 
story at face value.  


Favorable Street Perception of MPWR Spruce Point Reality Opinion


Improved governance through long-term 
compensation tied to financial performance 


Takeover target as the semiconductor cycle

Cautionary Quotes


MPWR’s Early 
Executive 


Commenting On 
Chang As A 


Board Member


“Well, okay. I'm a Board member myself as, as the, you know, as Board member who's really concerned about corporate governance. I would not put 
him very high on that list. But he's Taiwanese. He's a Taiwanese entrepreneur. He's invested in a lot of different things. He's made tons of money. His 
latest fun thing was he was, uh, helping, uh, singers in Taiwan. Uh, you know, it's like K-pop, Taiwan pop singers. He was sponsoring singers and stuff 
just for fun, very interesting guy. But, uh, uh, he's not, he's, Taiwanese, he doesn't really care much about corporate governance per se.”


“I always thought Herbet would leave the Board because you on the other hand, Michael doesn't make board members do much. So I think Herbert 
just stays on the Board just cause it's, you know, he's friends with Michael and it's fine with him. He doesn't have to do much work. He (Herbert) 
probably, makes/missed half the Board meetings.”


MPWR’s Early 
Executive 


Commenting On 
First Audit Chair 


Alan Earhart


“I did. And we went through some real hard, and we had some real difficulties with the failed Sarbanes-Oxley and Alan was a straight shooter. I mean, 
he's a partner for big, big four accounting firm. Um, and that was actually what got, Allen fired from the Board. Like, well, you're not fired. You're 
told not to sign up. Again, happened to Alan, he was kind of quite happy. Michael (CEO) doesn't like people asking questions he doesn't like. And 
Alan was doing his job as audit chairman and sort of rocked the boat too much. We got through all the three statements and all kinds of problems 
that we had to fix and thing are going smoothly and then. Allen disappeared.”


Note: During the 2008 period prior to Earhart’s departure, MPWR delayed its 10-Q, issued a non-reliance opinion, and noted a material weakness (source / source)


MPWR’s Original 
Executive 


Commenting On 
His Thoughts 


About MPWR As 
A Takeout Target


“You know, MPS carries a certain buyout premium. It's already baked into the price. Pick a number, 20%, 25%, assuming it's going to be 
bought. I think that's in there. Otherwise I can't figure out the P/E ratio. Uh, so, so the biggest issue is Michael not interested in selling the 
company. I mean, it's not the money. He does it because he likes to run it and the executives are with him I would say are not necessarily 
executives who would succeed at another company. I don't know how to put it in any other way that's just based on their culture and style. 
They would not necessarily show up at Intel and get a job. Right? So, so they all, I'm just being straight forward with you.”


“It's a great technology company. They've got a really unique position. They should be able to grow. But I sold all of my stock the day that I 
left because I just felt that they are not ethical. So, that's just me personally. My whole working career is always based on trust and if the 
customer doesn't trust me, I don't really understand how I'm ever going to get anything accomplished. MPS continually violated that trust 
between the customer and me. So, for me personally, I couldn’t. …  But if MPS needs to hit a number, this did come up a few times, if they 
need to hit a number to show a sale, they will force the distributor ... They’ll make a deal. They'll cut a deal with the distributor and they'll 
convert that inventory to distributor owned inventory to show that they met their numbers for the quarter.”

Spruce Point believes it’s likely that MPWR routes its cash through Singapore, which is owned by MPS International Ltd. 
(Bermuda). Singapore engaged in related-party transactions with Bermuda for “Services Rendered”. 


Yet, its Singapore subsidiary Monolithic Power Systems (Singapore) PTE. LTD currently has a going concern warning, and 
is audited by a three person firm called Plus LLP.(1)

Early Signs Of Accounting 
Challenges, Greater Obfuscation 
And Diminishing Edge At MPWR
17


MPWR’s Business Has Become 
Significantly More Opaque Post IPO…..


Over time, Monolithic has become less transparent and now omits key information to investors. 


Backlog


End Customers


Distributors


“Our semiconductors are ultimately contained in electronic 
products sold by original equipment manufacturers such as Acer, 
Dell, Hewlett-Packard, and IBM in the computing industry, LG 
Electronics, Samsung, and Sharp in the consumer electronics 
industry, and Apple, Dell, LG Electronics, and Motorola in the 
wireless industry.”


“Our largest direct customers in 2003 were CTP, Yosun, and 
Ambit/Unique Logistics, with whom we currently have or 
formerly had distribution arrangements, accounting for 30%, 
16%, and 14% of revenues, respectively. Our significant direct 
customers are Asian Information Technology, Uppertech, and 
Yosun, all three of which are distributors. For the nine months 
ended September 30, 2004, these customers represented 27%, 
20%, and 10% of our total revenues, respectively.”


“Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual 
purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have 
received from customers that have not yet shipped. Our backlog 
at September 30, 2004 was $8.3 million, and our backlog at 
September 30, 2003 was $3.4 million.”


“Our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard individual 
purchase orders. Our backlog consists of orders that we have 
received from customers which have not yet shipped. Because 
orders in backlog are subject to cancellation or postponement, and 
backlog at any particular date is not necessarily representative of 
actual sales for any succeeding period, we believe that our backlog 
is not necessarily a reliable indicator of future revenues.”


“Sales to our largest distributor accounted for 22% of our total 
revenue in 2018, 17% in 2017, and 22% in 2016. In addition, one 
other distributor accounted for 10% of our total revenue in 2018 
and one other distributor accounted for 10% of our total revenue 
in 2017. No other distributors or end customers accounted for 
more than 10% of our total revenue in any of the periods 
presented.”


“Distributors sell our products to end customers which include 
OEMs, ODMs or EMS providers.”


Manufacturing


“We currently contract with ASMC to manufacture our wafers in 
foundries located in China. Once our silicon wafers have been 
produced, they are shipped either to third party subcontractors or 
to our facilities in Los Gatos for wafer sort. Our semiconductor 
products are then assembled and packaged by independent 
subcontractors in Malaysia, China, and Thailand. The assembled 
ICs are then forwarded for final testing, primarily at our Los Gatos 
facilities, prior to shipping to our customers.”


“We currently contract with four suppliers to manufacture our 
wafers in foundries located in China and Korea. Once our silicon 
wafers have been produced, they are shipped to our facility in 
Chengdu, China for wafer sort, which is a testing process 
performed to identify non-functioning dies. Our semiconductor 
products are then assembled and packaged by independent 
subcontractors in China and Malaysia.”

CFO Departs Prior To IPO


In Spruce Point’s opinion, it is a bad sign when a Company is going through a CFO transition during an IPO process.

Accounting Challenges From Inception


Source: MPWR’s S-1 IPO Filing


As a backdrop to understanding the current MPWR story, it’s worth knowing that from its IPO, auditors noted 
“material weaknesses” related to the lack of formalized accounting policies and procedures, and sufficient staff in 


accounting and IT for its ERP systems. 


MPWR’s first CFO Christoffersen resigned in Sept 2015. In addition, Controller Dave Satterfield ceased to be 
mentioned thereafter, and seems to have also abruptly departed quickly after the IPO. 


IPO Risk Factor


“In addition, Tim Christoffersen and Dave 
Satterfield, our Chief Financial Officer and 
Controller, have served in those positions 
since only June 2004 and February 2004, 
respectively. Accordingly, our finance team 
has worked together for a relatively short 
period. Any failure of our finance team to 
communicate or work together effectively 
could adversely affect our business and results 
of operations.”

Later Resulting In Financial Restatement 
And Non-Reliance Opinion…..


Accounting weakness would fester. In 2008, MPWR notified investors that results for 2006 and 2007 could not be 
relied upon due to errors related to tax provisions. Yet, even while delaying its 10-Q, the Board granted executives 


the “maximum achievable” bonus for the  year.

Diminishing Engineering Edge


When MPWR came public, there is little disagreement it had a disruptive way of approaching power management 
solutions. The Company fought hard to protect its intellectual property, and succeeded.(1,2) Based on our industry 


research of talking to engineers and people familiar with MPWR’s end markets, we believe it is becoming increasingly 
clear that the Company is slowly losing its technical edge.


 MPWR had a process innovation 15-20 years ago. Their designs use 15-16 masks. Typical power control chips used to use 30;  MPWR’s process was 
materially cheaper 


 Each mask takes 1 - 1.5 days at the foundry, so MPWR’s process cut foundry time in half. Masks cost around $20 each, so cutting them in half reduces 
the processed wafer costs to about $450 from around $750


 But no edge lasts forever, particularly in China were intellectual property and proprietary processes are harder to police:
• We believe the Chinese have copied that process, and the very simplicity of it is a barrier to moving up to digital chips. In competitive areas such as 


consumer electronics, we hear that the Chinese can undercut MPWR’s 50%+ margins to as low as 10%
• MPWR has been telling investors it wants to grow into the automotive space and get qualified, not to get into the power management and GPS 


chips, but because autos pay more because the qualification process is 3-6 years
o We believe MPWR is making progress, mostly in lower end applications like windshield wipers, but it takes a long time.


• MPWR is unlikely to acquire design houses (to accelerate its growth) because its culture is very Chinese, and a more challenging cultural fit for 
Western managers


 Engineers also speak of defect problems with MPWR chips that often go undiscussed by management:
• Warranties have generally risen:


o Prior to August 1, 2005: Provided a standard 90 day warranty against any defects in material and workmanship
o 2005 – 2013: Beginning August 1, 2005 we increased our standard product warranty period from 90 days to one year. We provide a 


warranty against defects in materials and workmanship on all our products and will either repair the goods, provide replacements at no 
charge to the customer, or under certain circumstances, refund amounts to the customer for defective products.


o 2013-Today:  Our standard warranty period is generally one to two years, which exposes the company to significant risks of claims for 
defects and failures

Former MPWR 
Engineer


“MPS had an innovation edge about fifteen years ago that made their process much cheaper and they built a business 
based on that, but right now it’s limiting them from getting into the higher end business and the low end business, has 
been kind of eaten up by the Chinese.”

Appreciation Since 2013 Based On 
Accurate And Sustainable Results?

Wall Street Loves A Revenue Acceleration 
And Margin Expansion Story


Tough questions aren’t often asked when companies can put up accelerating double digit revenue growth while 
delivering stable margin expansion along the way. Wall Street has cheered MPWR’s miraculous change of fortune, and 
rewarded it with a 1,200% share price gain. However, MPWR is primarily a Chinese company, so we investigated further 


to evaluate the quality and sustainability of the results.

Double Digit Growth Historically Elusive


MPWR’s 
Former


Executive 
Commenting On 


His Thoughts 
About MPWR’s 


Recent 
Accelerated 


Revenue 
Performance


“That has surprised me. I would've bought more stock if I knew that. Yeah, because back in 
the day when I was doing that, you couldn't get that kind of revenue (growth). Well, the 
only years we had it was where we jumped into the consumer market and it turned around 
and bit us in the ass. But I probably looked at half a dozen acquisitions when I was there. 
Nothing interesting. They finally bought that power module company in Switzerland. But I 
mean Michael basically developed it himself. It basically take the ideas and, and he was to 
develop new products and ideas themselves. 


Spruce 
Point


“Has the recent success of the company surprised you at all? I mean the, the company has 
been able to really accelerate the revenue growth from, call it 9%, to now putting up 
consistent 20% plus growth and maintaining margins.”


We asked a key early financial executive his views on MPWR’s recent success. His opinion was insightful.

Dodgy ASP Disclosure Despite Significant 
Product Concentration


MPWR has historically reported >70% of its product family as DC to DC converters, and over time, has grown the category to 
>90% of sales. Yet, MPWR has forever claimed an inability to offer color on its ASPs. The last quote from former CFO Meera Rao 


in Jan 2016 about new products not translating into higher ASPs or margins is very revealing…..see next slide


“The way we roll out new products is that we usually -- once we have an idea and we know that technically we can do it, we go 
and approach our customers to see if there is an interest in the product and to ascertain how strong is their interest; and more
importantly, even though there might be an interest, whether they would actually pay us a premium for it, because we have 
found out that you can introduce really interesting products for markets like smart phones, TVs, and while they might give 
customers a lot of benefits, it doesn't translate into higher ASPs or better margin for us. So we do go and verify that.”

Q3 2010

“Actually our ASPs are very stable throughout our years. So customer now is -- customers always ask for lower, lower, lower 
price, and I think the bigger issue for us is still dealing with the shipment allocation. We just gone through that, and our -- that's 
our biggest issue is with our -- the relation -- the biggest relationship issues with our customers.”


Former CFO 
Neely


Q2 2010
Earnings Call


“Actually, Evan, we don't talk about ASP, because it just depends on a product by product. And ASPs can actually go down and 
gross margin can go up, so it's not a very good indicator, so we never discuss ASPs directly.”


CFO and CEO


Q2 2008
Earnings Call


CFO Neely: “No, we don’t (discuss ASPs) do that because we have so many different products with so many different price 
ranges it doesn't really come up with anything. Typically, we don't give a blended ASP because of the breadth of our products”
CEO Hsing: “It is difficult for us and overall product line we're within a few percentage difference with our average.”


“We optimized our top loading as much as we can, but in terms of prices, we haven't seen any movement down. And the last 
part was ASPs? In terms of ASPs, we're not seeing any significant movement other than whatever would be the normal 
year-over-year price decreases.”

CFO Retires After Saying New Products Don’t 
Translate Into Higher ASP or Margin And Then 
Margins And ASPs Increase


It appears incredibly suspicious that, after CFO Rao claimed new products don’t generate higher ASPs or margin, 
MPWR would then report record price increases in 2017/18. Prices fell on average 5% from 2013-2016. 


“The way we roll out new products is that we usually -- once we have an idea and we know that technically we can do it, we go and approach our 
customers to see if there is an interest in the product and to ascertain how strong is their interest; and more importantly, even though there might 
be an interest, whether they would actually pay us a premium for it, because we have found out that you can introduce really interesting

This increase was due to higher sales of both DC to DC and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 37% due to higher market demand with current 
customers and additional design wins with new customers, which were offset in part by a 13% decrease in average sales prices.”


“Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013 was $238.1 million, an increase of $24.3 million, or 11.4%, from $213.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2012. 
This increase was due to higher sales of both DC to DC and lighting control products, as unit shipments increased 18% due to higher market demand with current 
customers and additional design wins with new customers, which were offset in part by a 6% decrease in average sales prices.”

CEO Ramps Up Use of “Killer Products” 
Language Post Rao’s Departure


Following the CFO’s departure in 2016, the CEO starts ramping up language about “killer products”, but they are never mentioned again 
as producing revenues. The product descriptions are vague, but appear to be focused on the communications segment. Revenues in 


communications decreased 1.7% in 2017 and increased 11% in 2018 due to higher networking applications. When the “killer” technologies 
referenced by the CEO are googled, we find little in the way of information about what these technologies are based on. 


“I see if we have change, we have something -- a killer product, which what we're bringing this year. I think we released already. And so that's our growth 
strategy. And other things worth to mention about, since we're now focused on the mega market and also we're now focusing -- we're now doing things chasing the 
revenue next 12 months. We have really a long consistency, see where our values, where things ought to be. And that's where we've put our resources into.”


“but my take on is, okay, we have to have a killer product, and we are releasing this killer product”


CEO Hsing
William Blair


June and July 
2016


“And I said okay, we will release some good killer product in the market segments, and if that is a Quantum State Modulation or QS Mod, we will have a series of 
products that we are going to announce in those quarters. And if you go to the electronica show, we will show it there.”


CEO Hsing
Q3 2016


CEO Hsing
Q1 2017


“Yes, as I said, we're going to introduce some great products and that killer product is out. We already introduced. And I expected to have the next couple of years 
that we're going to grow that business significantly”


CEO Hsing
Q1 2019


“And I mentioned that in our, we have some killer products come out and we’re also waiting for new product cycles. And these product hit the market and now 
move the revenue needles now. In the gateway, it's very price competitive. And under the current situation, we want the revenues, and we just grab those market 
shares.”


“So -- but my take on is, okay, we have to have a killer product, and we are releasing this killer product.”


“No, it is FPPM. Based on the FPPM technologies and targeted telecom applications.”


CEO Hsing


Q2 2016


A google search of “FPPM 
technologies” produces nothing in 


the way of information or 
relevance to Telecom apps. 


A google search of “Quantum 
State Modulation or QS Mod” 
produces nothing meaningful

2) China gross margins are from Chengdu while margins reported to investors are consolidated Non-GAAP
3) Reported inventories at the consolidated level as MPWR doesn’t report inventory by geography


Through Chinese attorneys, we obtained tax filings for MPWR’s three Chinese subsidiaries.(1) Assuming no inter-
company sales, the three subsidiaries together reported ~$73m in gross revenues and 35.9% gross margin in 2018:  


78% lower sales and gross margins 1,970bps lower. Despite our estimate that 90% of production occurs in China, the 
Chinese entities reported almost no inventory. Where is the $100-$136m of year end inventory reported at the 


consolidated level if none of it is being reported to the tax authorities in China?

As we’ve already shown: 1) MPWR’s Chinese tax filings do not account for ~$262m of revenue, and 2) MPWR’s 
inventory turnover metrics are ballooning and a significant industry outlier despite stable and steady gross margin 
growth that management touts. If we assume that MPWR’s inventory metrics should be in line with industry peers, 


and that $245 - $265m of revenue is overstated, it implies ~$93m of inventory is also overstated.

Case Study: Vitesse Semiconductor 
Accounting Scandal; DIOs Similar To MPWR’s


Vitesse Semiconductor was a brazen revenue inflation scheme involving forcing inventory on distributors with rights of 
return. Vitesse executive did this to hit Wall Street targets, and cash out of lucrative options. Vitesse’s accounting 


scheme was so egregious, it was never able to completely restate its revenues. Vitesse’s Days Inventory Outstanding 
were rising rapidly prior to the scandal unfolding. MPWR’s current DIOs are even higher.

Source: Vitesse Semiconductor Financials


Source: SEC.gov and complaint


“Near the end of each quarter, beginning on or about December 
2002~ Vitesse routinely shipped large amounts of inventory to Nu 
Horizons. As the close of each quarter approached, Tomasetta and 
Hovanec directed Vitesse employees to ship product to Nu Horizons 
in order to close the gap between Tomasetta's internally forecasted 
revenue target and Vitesse’s actual quarterly revenue. During 
weekly revenue meetings, Tomasetta and Hovanec instructed 
members of the sales staff to maximize the amount of inventory 
Vitesse shipped to Nu Horizons. Tomasetta, Hovanec, Mody, Kaplan 
and others then discussed in smaller, closed-door meetings, specific 
product shipments to Nu Horizons that would be made in order to 
close the revenue gap identified by Tomasetta and Hovanec. The 
defendants sometimes referred to these quarterly shipments as 
quarterly stocking packages ("QSPs").”

Suspicious Inventory Disclosure Practices


For a period of 10 years after its IPO, MPWR omitted disclosure of its raw materials inventory accounts. Given that 
raw materials can be a powerful indicator of future demand growth, we find this omission concerning. Recent raw 


material disclosures in 2014 now provide useful insights.

We believe MPWR’s inventory accounts are signaling a sharp slow down in demand. Per MPWR’s disclosures, it 
builds inventory in advance of expected demand for its products. As a result, raw material inventory growth should 
be a leading indicator for future performance. We find that raw materials to total inventory peaked in Q4 2018. Raw 


material growth is slowing, and turned negative in Q2 2019.


“We purchase inventory in advance based on expected demand for our products, and if demand is not as expected, we 
may have insufficient or excess inventory, which could adversely impact our financial position.”


“Our manufacturing lead times are generally 8 to 16 weeks and we often build inventory in advance of customer orders 
based on our forecast of future customer orders”

Inventory Charges Now Exploding


Within a year after MPWR claimed inventory growth was a result of needing to meet “current demand and future growth”, $10.5m 
(7.7% of inventories) was written down unexpectedly, and a wafer supplier agreement was terminated in Dec 2018. Yet, remarkably 


MPWR was still able to expand and hit its gross margin target in 2018. 
We believe wafer agreements take a long time to get qualified, so we believe the disruption could be a medium term headwind.


2017 Inventory 
Discussion


“The increase in inventories was primarily driven by an increase in strategic wafer and die inventories as well as 
an increase in finished goods to meet current demand and future growth.”


2018 Inventory 
Discussion


“The increase in cost of revenue was also driven by a $10.5 million increase in inventory write-downs, a $2.1 
million increase in warranty expenses, and a $1.7 million increase in manufacturing overhead costs, which was 
partially offset by a $1.2 million decrease in amortization expense as certain intangible assets were fully 
amortized in 2018..”


2018 Wafer 
Termination 


“In December 2018, a supplier terminated a prepaid wafer purchase agreement with the Company and 
agreed to refund the Company the remaining wafer purchase prepayment of $4.3 million, which was recorded 
as a receivable as of December 31, 2018.”

Revenue Recognition Disclosure Language 
Change Gives New Insights


New mention of consignment agreements in revenue recognition discussion is suspicious in context of increasingly 
bloated inventory, and write-downs that are occurring. 


Product sales consist of a single performance obligation that we satisfy at a point in time. We recognize product revenue from 
distributors and direct end customers when the following events have occurred: (a) we have transferred physical possession of the 
products, (b) we have a present right to payment, (c) the customer has legal title to the products, and (d) the customer bears 
significant risks and rewards of ownership of the products. In accordance with the shipping terms specified in the contracts, these 
criteria are generally met when the products are shipped from our facilities (such as the “Ex Works” shipping term) or delivered to 
the customers’ locations (such as the “Delivered Duty Paid” shipping term).


Under certain consignment agreements, revenue is not recognized when the products are shipped and delivered to be held at 
customers’ designated locations because we continue to control the products and retain ownership, and the customers do not 
have an unconditional obligation to pay. We recognize revenue when the customers pull the products from the locations or, in 
some cases, after a 60-day period from the delivery date has passed, at which time control transfers to the customers and we 
invoice them for payment.


We account for price adjustment and stock rotation rights as variable consideration that reduces the transaction price, and 
recognize that reduction in the same period the associated revenue is recognized. Three U.S.-based distributors have price 
adjustment rights when they sell our products to their end customers at a price that is lower than the distribution price invoiced 
by us. When we receive claims from the distributors that products have been sold to the end customers at the lower price, we 
issue the distributors credit memos for the price adjustments. We estimate the price adjustments based on an analysis of 
historical claims, at both the distributor and product level, as well as an assessment of any known trends of product sales mix. Other 
U.S. distributors and non-U.S. distributors, which make up the majority of our total sales to distributors, do not have price 
adjustment rights.

2018: “Revenue from the consumer market decreased $5.6 million, or 3.0%, from the same period in 2017. This decrease 
was primarily due to softness in demand for high volume consumer-related products, particularly those sold in the greater 
China region.”
2017: “Revenue from the consumer market increased $36.0 million, or 23.4%, from the same period in 2016. This increase

More Signs Suggesting A Stuffed 
Distributor Channel


• Represents less than 10%


Source: MPWR’s Q2 2019 10-Q


For the first time in Q2 2019, MPWR disclosed “Company A (direct)” as a material customer and accounting for 16% 
of accounts receivables outstanding. We believe this supports our opinion that MPWR’s distributor channels are 


full, and it is now going direct to a customer. Given the materiality, we believe MPWR must disclose this customer.

Relationship With Microsoft Appears To 
Be On A Shaky Foundation


MPWR appears to have a rocky relationship with its largest customer, yet somehow manages “very smooth growth”
and is “adept” at “managing the margin”. 


“Quinn, this is Michael. Although the company's strategy is that we don't really care in which market segment how we time it 
and how we time it in related to growing our MPS revenues, so these -- we actually -- in opposite, we don't want to -- we 
want to get associated with -- are we tied to Xbox, are we tied to whatever the game console have, like game platforms, 
and the Intel, when they're going to release the -- into production of whatever the processor is. These are just our 
opportunity and that we only want to ensure our gross margin and a steady growth. And our customers phasing whatever 
the -- whichever the product is, we don't count that. And it's all within a plus/minus 6, 7 months, as I said earlier.”

“Just to go in a little bit more on the consumer side and the weakness you've been seeing there. I think historically, you guys 
have said that of your consumer revenue, about 50% of it's traditional. I think 30% of it's high value and 20% of it's gaming. Are 
you seeing the weakness in gaming as well? Or is it only in that 50% traditional bucket? And if it's in the traditional bucket, is 
it -- should we consider the whole 50% weak? Or it's only parts of that? Just sort of trying to quantify where consumer could go
from here given that seems to be -- in one bucket, that's the most at risk in the short term.”


CEO Hsing


Q3 2018
Oct 2018


“Yes. I hate to say that in the last couple of times that we talked about gaming, our customers not happy, okay. We can't do 
that. And the one time I said that it wasn't my favorite topic, okay, our customer heard that. Okay, so gaming is my 
favorite. There's a lot of money to be made with 100% of the components, okay. But here is what have we got, and again, we 
see high volumes. And we're not talking about what kind of gaming, okay, we see a bit of softness. And these are high-
volume ones. And other than that, we see connected device or the IoT, if you will, okay, and a variety of other gauges. And we 
see -- in our designing, we see the market demand is still very similar.”


CFO Blegen


Q3 2018
Oct 2018


“And then as far as how we manage the margin with the consumer, that's something that we're adept at being able to do.”


“Well, in the gaming, and I can't openly say it. It's not my favorite topics. And it goes up by a quarter a lot, and then the next 
couple of quarters it comes down. And I want to manage a very, very smooth growth and then comes sustainable growth. 
And so these things you mentioned about gaming, of course, there is a lot of dollars to be made. And these are very 
opportunistic, so that's why we said, we have a few percentage variation.”

Fizzling Auto Ambitions


MPWR’s tried to diversify into the higher margin auto industry with early success that now appears to be rapidly fading. Auto
revenues really started ramping in 2014-15, and per the CEO the design cycle is 3-4 years, it shouldn’t be a surprise that auto sales 


are peaking. Despite MPWR talking sustainable 40-50% revenue CAGRs, actual results are decelerating fast in H1 2019. (1)


CEO Hsing
April 2017


“Yes, for the automotive in MPS, as you know, we entered the market about 4 or 5 years ago, and 4 or 5 years ago, our revenue almost 0. And 
even 2, 3 years ago very teeny, teeny, tiny. And it takes a long time to get the revenue. And so design cycle is about 3 to 4 years. And we are total 
TAM in automotive, it's about $6 billion, probably a little -- now they're more than that. And so what is our percentage? It's less than 1%. So it's a 
total greenfield for us to grow”


CEO Hsing 
Commenting 


on Auto 
Feb 2018


“Yes, it is fair that the growth rate it will not change much. Okay, but don't quote me exactly what's the rate. It would be very similar to this 
year. Which applications or which segments, I think in the next couple of years we're going to expand lot more segments. Now the lighting, 
infotainments and the safeties, and we will have a lot more safety products come out. And as Bernie said in his script, we have an ADAS and also 
the battery management as well as the connectivities. And those areas have a very little revenue or some of the items have no revenue, only 
sampling. And we expect to have a very high percentage growth in -- a very dollar amount growth in 2019, '20 and ‘21”

“The other thing I want to also point out is we're growing so fast, okay? 55% year-on-year growth last year. Take a look at the total semiconductor 
market in auto. It's about 13%, right? 4x growth versus the market. And you can see the TAM that we're going after, $7 billion. …Really, we're at 
this moment where the opportunity is incredible. MPS happens to be at the right place at the right time. We've learned from the last 5 years of 
innovation of selling. We understand the customers. We have the great products. We see the growth really continuing over the next 5, 6 years, 
easily, 40% to 50% CAGR”

Market Color From China Distributors


 To understand sales trends this year and last, we interviewed various distributors that operate in and around Monolithic’s 
industry


 Monolithic lists on its website its China distributors as a starting point 
 Public Chinese tax filings for three of the distributors can be obtained. Almost all saw strong sales growth in 2018, but many 


expect flat to declining sales in 2019. 
 The average growth in China for 2018, based on the financial statements obtained, was around 18%. This compares with 


30% reported revenue growth in China by MPWR for 2018
 The distributors said growth came mostly from new customers. The growing segments named were:


• Security products and storage
• Automotive
• Camera lenses for mobile phones and computers


 One distributor said sales had declined in 2018 by 20-25% because of volatility in prices of end-user products due to the U.S.-
China trade frictions. This company expected flat to declining sales for 2019 compared with 2018.


 For 2019, Distributors Were Uniformly Negative: Though about half said that they expected sales to be roughly flat or to 
grow a little bit. Most expected sales declines but did not predict by how much. They blamed trade tensions and declining 
Chinese consumption. Some sectors at risk:


• Chips supplied to set-top boxes
• Consumer electronics, especially mobile phones, are weak
• In low-end electrical components, like plug converters, price competition is very intense


“We expect sales to be down by about 15%,” said one distributor that sells about $45m in electronic components 
annually. “This year the consumer products market is very poor. Huawei’s orders are down, and that directly affects 
my customers and indirectly drags down our sales.(1) ZTE’s orders are also down. . . A lot of our customers sell to the 
U.S. The 2018 backlog is pretty intense, so this year’s sales will drop.”

Former Sales Executive Interview


“It's a great technology company. They've got a really unique position. They should be able to grow. But I sold all of my stock 
the day that I left because I just felt that they are not ethical. So, that's just me personally. My whole working career is always 
based on trust and if the customer doesn't trust me, I don't really understand how I'm ever going to get anything accomplished. 
MPS continually violated that trust between the customer and me. So, for me personally, I couldn't.”


Former MPWR 
Sales Account 


Executive


“So, they have great technology, there's a lot of stuff they do really well. But it's incredibly volatile. In a lot of cases, the 
customer that we're talking about has gotten to a position where they feel like if they have an alternative, they'll explore
the alternative. They feel like they're stuck.”


“No, and so all the years I've been in the industry, which is 30+ years with multiple semiconductor companies, I've shipped over
a billion dollars worth of semiconductor content. Bermuda's never been part of the conversation. That is purely, and I don't 
say this from firsthand knowledge, but I'm throwing a dart, that's purely some type of tax evasion scheme. There's no 
reason. It doesn't make ... Yeah. It doesn't make any sense.”


“But if MPS needs to hit a number, this did come up a few times, if they need to hit a number to show sale, they will force the 
distributor ... They’ll make a deal. They'll cut a deal with the distributor and they'll convert that inventory to distributor 
owned inventory to show that they met their numbers for the quarter.”


“There's a lot of things that I don't agree with MPS doing, but one of the things that they do a really good job of is they will 
respond very quickly to a customer who says, "Hey. I really like this part number 123. But I'd like it in a different package and 
I'd like an extra pin here or there or I want the voltage to be slightly different." They are willing to be less encumbered than
maybe they should be and they'll do something special with no written agreement from the customer, depending on who the 
customer is, and they’ll just make the samples and do the data sheet and go back in and say, "Here. Test this and we want to 
engage.“…. So, they're very good. I'll give you an example. There's a cloud customer, a key particular engineer said, "My 
interpretation of MPS is it's like the cowboys. They come in on the horse super fast and they just start shooting at 
everything. They don't even really care what they hit. They're just shooting. They come in guns blazing. Then after the dust
settles, they may have to apologize for some friendly fire.“”

Context To Guidance And Ability To 
Relentlessly Meet Wall St. Expectations


We believe a majority of Monolithic’s end markets are tied to cyclical industries, with the exception perhaps of 
communications, which MPWR has been diversifying away from, and storage. MPWR does not sell into more 


stable markets such as aerospace and defense, medical products and equipment, or power transmission / 
infrastructure markets, for example. Thus, we believe their exposure to cyclical end markets is above average.

Some of the biggest companies in the industry don’t offer gross margin guidance, which makes MPWR’s ability to offer 
such precise guidance, that it rarely misses, very remarkable.

Beware of Bermuda: Material Cash 
Center In A Notoriously Secret Tax Haven 


MPWR’s segment and geographic reporting gives a potentially misleading view of its business. It claims that ~58% of 
revenues in 2018 were to China, “based on the customers ship-to-locations”. As a U.S. based and stock listed company, 


MPWR claims just 3% of sales are to United States customers. 


Source: MPWR’s 2018 10-K


MPS International Ltd. (Bermuda) 
would be a material subsidiary based 
on the majority of sales being foreign. 


Yet, per the recent PCAOB Form AP 
filing, there is no local auditor 


evaluating this region (see slide)

Bermuda Tax Haven


In light of our findings that >17% of revenues are to Microsoft, a U.S. company, it’s remarkable that MPWR reports pre-
tax losses from U.S. operations. The Company has been audited before by the IRS and settled.(1) Additional audits 


could result in greater financial risk to investors.  MPWR also appears to run a majority of its cash through Bermuda, 
yet doesn’t call Bermuda out as a special tax jurisdiction, instead citing Chengdu, Hangzhou, and Switzerland.

one-time buy-in payment of $1.2 million for taxes related primarily to the revaluation of a license for certain intellectual property rights of the Company to one of its international subsidiaries


“As of December 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $172.7 million and short-term investments of $204.6 million, compared with

$143.8 million of cash and cash equivalents and $101.0 million of short-term investments were held by our international subsidiaries. As a 


result of the enactment of the 2017 Tax Act, we currently plan to repatriate cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to fund our future

Spruce Point believes it’s likely that MPWR routes its cash through Singapore, which is owned by MPS International Ltd. 
(Bermuda). Singapore engaged in related-party transactions with Bermuda for “Services Rendered”. 


Yet, its Singapore subsidiary Monolithic Power Systems (Singapore) PTE. LTD currently has a going concern warning, and 
is audited by a three person firm called Plus LLP.(1)

Capital Allocation Mystery


In today’s environment, Spruce Point finds many companies prioritizing capital allocation decisions towards 
acquisitions, share repurchases and dividends. Monolithic takes a very different approach to capital allocation. 


Curiously, it’s biggest capital priority is buying land and real estate. As we will show, its recent real estate purchases 
was at a significant premium, and is not even close to being utilized.

Monolithic has grown its dividend recently, but well below its potential. If you take Monolithic’s financials at face 
value, EPS is up nearly 400% in the same period the dividend is up 166%. The dividend payout ratio has fallen too. 


Excess cash has been building up with no purpose. Monolithic does not do M&A, and hasn’t repurchased any shares 
since 2015 (the same year its CEO sold the most stock ever).

Capital Allocation Mystery: Land Speculation 
or Development?


Monolithic was intent on developing a 50,000 sqft property from scratch, and even purchased raw land, that it fortunately 
flipped at a profit. This will be a one-time gain reported in Q3 2019.

“Insane” Real Estate Purchase


Spruce Point believe it’s an enormous red flag to see Monolithic purchase an even larger 75,000 sqft commercial real estate 
property for a 35% premium just nine months after a commercial investor purchased the property, and made no improvements. 


According to a local broker, Monolithic intends to occupy only a “small portion” of the building. 
In addition, the source of the funds is Bermuda, a notorious haven for murky financial dealings.  


While it is clear that Microsoft is a material customer to Monolithic, there is some potential business motivation behind the
transaction, including tax incentives to the executives for working in a state with no state tax. That being said, the large premium 


being paid begs the question if an ulterior motive is at work here.  


“Clarion Partners was in the right place at the right time last fall 
when it paid $39.25 million for a four-story office building on 
Lake Washington in Kirkland.


Public records show the New York City-headquartered investment 
manager on Monday sold the 75,000-square-foot for $53 million 
to Monolithic Power Systems Inc., a global tech company whose 
Seattle regional office is a mile south of its newly acquired asset, 
the tiered Lake Washington Park Building at 5808 Lake 
Washington Blvd. NE.


The building increased in value 35 percent in just nine months 
even though Clarion did not upgrade the property. The building 
was fully leased when Clarion bought it with leases set to expire. 


Supposedly, (Monolithic) will occupy small portion of the 
building," the broker said.”

“For the three months ended March 31, 2019, we repatriated $75 million of cash from our Bermuda subsidiary to the

Hangzhou and Chengdu Property


An agent for this building in Hangzhou confirmed by 
phone to Spruce Point’s investigator that MPWR had 


purchased space there, but would not reveal how much 
space, or for how much per square meter. In 2017, the 


company reported adding 34,000 square feet in 
Hangzhou. At that time in Hangzhou, the price per square 
foot would have been about $365, so 34,000 square feet 


could have cost $13m.


The only record of a purchase by MPWR in Chengdu is from 
2011, when the company bought land for just $388,000. However, 
public records display only sales by government owners. When 
property is sold by contract with a private owner, the record is 


usually not available.

Why does Monolithic need to have so much square footage per employee? MPWR’s 381 sqft per employee is the 
highest among peers, and well above the industry average at 312. With so much real estate square footage, and no 


disclosures of employees by region / function, or margins by product / region, MPWR can allocate overhead in a 
way that it deems best to flatter its margins. As we’ve previously illustrated, margins are suspiciously stable.

Deloitte Dismissed As Auditor Just As It 
Started Scrutinizing China More?


With almost 50% of assets in China and 57% of sales there, it’s remarkable that, according to PCAOB records, Deloitte’s China
affiliate just started auditing China in 2017. Yet in 2017, the China audit accounted for just 5-10% of the audit. This figure rose to 


10-20% in 2018.  In March 2019, MPWR dismissed Deloitte in favor of E&Y. Does this suggest that MPWR was not happy that 
Deloitte was scrutinizing China more carefully?

CFO Appears To Misrepresent His CPA


Monolithic’s CFO claims to be a CPA. However, state records show his license is “Cancelled” as of Aug 31, 1985.

Audit Partner Overlap With Super Micro


We find it curious that MPWR has the same audit engagement partner as Super Micro (OTC Bulletin: SMCI). Super Micro has been 
embroiled in an accounting scandal, had its stock delisted from the Nasdaq, and is currently delinquent in its SEC filings.(1) Super 


Micro was also referenced in a report by Bloomberg in Oct 2018 as potentially having been compromised by chips from China used

In August 2017, prior to the issuance of our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017, the audit 
committee (the “Audit Committee”) of our Board of Directors (the “Board”) commenced an investigation (the “Investigation”) into 
certain accounting and internal control matters, principally focused on certain revenue recognition matters…During the course of 
the Investigation, the further procedures by outside counsel and the management analysis (collectively, the “Investigation, 
Procedures and Analysis”), the Audit Committee and management determined certain employees had violated our Code of Business 
Conduct and Ethics and discovered accounting and financial reporting errors and certain irregularities. On November 14, 2018, the

that certain previously filed consolidated financial statements and related financial information should no longer be relied upon.

Board Insights From A Former MPWR 
Executive From The Early Days


As part of our diligence, we spoke with a former senior executive from the early days at Monolithic. His insights about 
the Board, and notably that the Audit Chairman was asked to leave for “asking questions the CEO didn’t like” that 


“rocked the boat” should be viewed as a major red flag. 


MPWR’s Early 
Executive 


Commenting On 
Chang As A 


Board Member


“I would not put him very high on that list. But he's Taiwanese. He's a Taiwanese entrepreneur. He's invested in a lot of 
different things. He's made tons of money. His latest fun thing was he was, uh, helping, uh, singers in Taiwan. Uh, you 
know, it's like K-pop, Taiwan pop singers. He was sponsoring singers and stuff just for fun, very interesting guy. But, uh, 
uh, he's not, he's, Taiwanese, he doesn't really care much about corporate governance per se.”


“I always thought Herbet would leave the Board because on the other hand, Michael doesn't make board members do 
much. So I think Herbert just stays on the Board just cause it's, you know, he's friends with Michael and it's fine with him. 
He doesn't have to do much work. He (Herbert) probably, makes/missed half the Board meetings.”


Spruce 
Point “Can you talk about Herbert Chang as an early investor in the Company and Board member.”


Spruce 
Point


“Just looking back at the original people involved. Mr Alan Earhart, PwC, he was the Chairman of the Audit Committee. 
He left in 2009, did you interact with him?”


MPWR’s Early 
Executive 


Commenting On 
Audit Chair Alan 


Earhart


“And we went through some real hard, and we had some real difficulties with the failed Sarbanes-Oxley and Alan was a 
straight shooter. I mean, he's a partner for big four accounting firm. Um, and that was actually what got, Allen fired 
from the Board. Like, well, you're not fired. You're told not to sign up. Again, happened to Alan, he was kind of quite 
happy. Michael (CEO) doesn't like people asking questions he doesn't like. And Alan was doing his job as audit 
chairman and sort of rocked the boat too much. We got through all the three statements and all kinds of problems that 
we had to fix and things are going smoothly and then Alan disappeared.”


Note: During the 2008 period prior to Earhart’s departure, MPWR delayed its 10-Q, issued a non-reliance opinion, and noted a material weakness (source / source)

Victor Lee: Current Audit Chair


Alan Earhart, who was described as having left because he “rocked the boat”, was replaced as Audit Chair in 2009 by Victor K. 
Lee. Lee last served as CFO at Ambarella (Nasdaq: AMBA) from 2007-2011, yet on MPWR’s website it still claims he is CFO. 


Lee also served as CFO of Leadis Technology, a fabless semiconductor company that failed and was delisted. 
Leadis settled a shareholder lawsuit, without admitting, that it misled investors.

Not So Friendly Long-Term Comp Program


While MPWR claimed an improved compensation structure tying long-term performance to management pay, it did so without any 
recourse if the results are based on flawed results. The clawback policy applies only to short-term incentives. Furthermore, the 
“Board determines, at its sole discretion” if the ill-gotten gains are recouped. We have little confidence that the CEO’s buddy 


Herbert Chang would stand in the way of pay he received. 


“In 2013, we granted two separate performance-based full-value awards – one that focused our NEOs on revenue achievement for a two-year period, 
and the other that focused our NEOs solely on stock price performance over a five-year period and an additional five-year time-based retention 
vesting period following the performance period, for a total vesting period of ten years. As a result, for 2013, 87% of shares subject to the target 
equity compensation awards that our NEOs could ultimately earn were clearly tied to specific, pre-established revenue and stockholder return 
performance goals”


“We heard investors tell us that compensation recovery policies, or clawbacks, were a best practice and should be adopted. In February 2012, we 
adopted our Compensation Recoupment Policy, which permits the Board to recoup any excess performance-based cash compensation paid to 
key members of our executive team if the financial results on which the performance-based compensation awards were based are restated due 
to fraud or intentional misconduct by the executive”


MPWR touts new long-term 
incentive structure, yet 
does not subject it to the 
clawback policy for fraud

The analyst are unanimously bullish on MPWR. Miraculously, the most bullish ones are the brokers that have no 
physical presence in China, which is almost 60% of its business. Even if you assume our research is entirely wrong, 


the current implied upside of 16% represents a very poor risk / reward in light of Chinese end markets slowing, and the 
extreme overvaluation of the share price.

All-Time High Valuation Makes No Sense


EV / NTM Sales Price / NTM EBITDA


Monolithic’s multiple is expanding at exactly the wrong time: it’s financials are signaling extreme pressure, its auditor 
was just dismissed, and its end markets are weakening.

Relative Valuation


We believe the market ascribes a premium multiple to MPWR based on faulty assumptions about it business; notably, 
that it has takeout potential, and a defensible, low cost business model that is durable enough to withstand cyclical 
economic and competitive pressures. The market also believes that MPWR can grow revenues at a premium to the 


semiconductor industry next year at 19.1% vs the industry’s 5.6% average growth. We do not believe these projections 
are realistic.

Irrational Premium As A Takeover Target…
Not So Fast


As part of our diligence, we spoke with a former senior executive from the Post IPO era at Monolithic. We asked for his 
opinion if he thought MPS would ever be a takeover-target. 


MPWR’s Early 
Executive 


Commenting On 
His Thoughts 


About MPWR As 
A Takeout Target


“You know, MPS carries a certain buyout premium. It's already baked into the price. Pick a number, 20%, 
25%, assuming it's going to be bought. I think that's in there. Otherwise I can't figure out the P/E ratio. 
Uh, so, so the biggest issue is Michael not interested in selling the company. I mean, it's not the money. 
He does it because he likes to run it and the executives are with him I would say are not necessarily 
executives who would succeed at another company. I don't know how to put it in any other way that's 
just based on their culture and style. They would not necessarily show up at Intel and get a job. 
Right? So, so they all, I'm just being straight forward with you.


Well, there's, as you said, the numbers. I think the thing that kept people from buying it, it's like, what 
happens if all  these guys leave. And then what do we got? So that's always the biggest thing is the 
magic sauce leaves then really getting anything from the deal, right? 


The whole different culture, I think that's the biggest thing that keeps anybody from even trying to 
buy it. And so they're not, they're not sure. Uh, you know, and particularly since all the engineering 
now is mostly done in China and if you're not Chinese, you're not exactly sure if you're not speaking 
the language, if that's true or what's going on or who your key people are, all those kinds of things. 
So I think, uh, I think that's the strength of MPS, but also something that would keep a buyer away.”


Spruce 
Point


“Do you think there is a buyer for the company? If you put it up for sale, you do you think somebody 
would buy it? ”

In the case where revenues are not overstated, but margins 
are overstated from inventory inflation:
1) Chinese Tax filings which represent MPWR’s largest 


geographic sales market accurately depict 36% margins
2) Recall: Chinese filings show no inventory. China accounts 


for ~90% of production. Current inventory = $143.6m
3) Generously assumes sales estimates for the year can be 


achieved despite strong evidence of slowdown in the 
Chinese semi, consumer and data storage markets


4) Include the Transition Tax liabilities due through 2025 
from the 2017 Tax Act


5) We generously assume full value for the cash and 
equivalents (including long-term auction rate securities), 
despite it being routed in the secretive jurisdiction of
