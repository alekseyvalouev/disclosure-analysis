Spruce Point Has Succeeded In Energy 
Shareholder Activism


Spruce Point wrote a critical activist report on Just Energy in 2013. Shares collapsed over 96% since the report and the 
Company finally conducted a recapitalization in July 2020. We believe the common theme between Just Energy and 


Sunnova is that both companies offer a relatively undifferentiated product and service offering and carry too much debt. 
Investors chasing growth and its dividend without a long-term plan towards sustained profits were ultimately let down.

Executive Summary

Spruce Point Estimates 70% - 80% Downside 
($5.00 - $8.00/share) For NOVA


Sunnova Energy International (“NOVA” or “the Company”) is a residential solar financing business caught in the rising tide of solar 
energy. In reality, Sunnova is a specialty finance company with undifferentiated offerings that operates in a competitive industry facing 
secular headwinds. We believe management masks its poor and unsustainable economics with potentially misleading and assumption-


based non-GAAP metrics and aggressive accounting. Unlike its solar peers and other financing businesses, Sunnova promotes Adjusted 
EBITDA, which we believe is the entirely wrong metric to evaluate a business heavily dependent on consumer financing. This is 


supported by our conversations with a former Sunnova executive, and industry experts who shared our conclusion. Gross contracted 
customer value is highly dependent on management’s estimates which are based on limited historical data and should not provide 


investors with confidence. CEO William Berger’s biography omits his previous role at Enron, whose aggressive financial accounting and 
reporting led to its demise. In addition, CFO Lane obscures his tenure at Madison Williams, a bankrupt broker backed by two investors 


later charged with fraud. As growth slows and margins deteriorate, the Company’s cash flow profile continues to worsen. We believe the 
potential misconception of Sunnova as a solar business, as apposed to a financing business, results in sell-side analysts ascribing 


irrationally high price targets and support its extreme overvaluation. The upcoming catalyst of management’s lockup expiring at the end 
of September, combined with Energy Capital Partners continuing to liquidate its equity stake, will result in additional downside risk.


Solar Industry Trends Provide Significant Headwinds For Sunnova
 As solar systems become more affordable, the industry is shifting from 3rd party ownership (leases and PPAs) where Sunnova realizes 96% of 


its revenue, to 100% customer ownership
• Purchases with cash and loans allow customers to realize the largest savings. In the long-run, customers should favor the option allowing 


them to capture the greatest financial benefit
 New entrants into the loan market, including Loanpal, continue to gain market share, representing 30% of new loans in Q1 2020 and 17% of all 


solar financing
 Shifting a larger portion of financings through loans may cannibalize highly profitable solar renewable energy certificate (SREC) revenue
 Losing the investment tax credit will further hurt the economics of Sunnova’s business. Even if the current 30% level is renewed, industry 


headwinds look to inhibit the Company’s growth
Undifferentiated Business Model, Ill-Positioned In A Highly Competitive Industry Based On A Porter’s Five Forces Analysis
 Sunnova is a small player relative to peers. The merger between Sunrun and Vivint Solar creates the largest player in the industry, well-


positioned to capture cost savings and compete more aggressively for new customers to achieve greater scale
 Value proposition does not differentiate Sunnova from its peers:


• Customer relationships: any solar company offering long-term financing and servicing contracts can claim strong relationships
• Asset ownership: Sunnova has $1.98bn in solar assets compared to Sunrun’s $4.64bn and Vivint Solar’s $1.85bn
• Local dealer network: increases counterparty risk; independent salesforce would be expected to direct customer where they are paid the 


best. We have found several examples of concerning sales practices and other activities by Sunnova and dealer partners
 Sungevity, another Energy Capital Partner investment, filed bankruptcy after claiming a similar asset-light business model, industry-leading 


customer acquisition platform and channel partner network

Spruce Point Estimates 70% - 80% Downside 
($5.00 - $8.00/share) For NOVA


We Believe EBITDA And Contracted Customer Value Metrics Are Completely Meaningless To Evaluate Sunnova
 Core earnings, which continue to decline, should be the primary metric to measure the performance of a specialty finance business
 Adjusted EBITDA is a misleading metric to evaluate the financial performance of a financing business


• EBITDA is not an accurate proxy for free cash flow and does not reflect the Company’s financial performance, as Adjusted EBITDA has 
grown while operating cash flow and free cash flow has declined


• Treats interest and depreciation as non-core, while they are core to a financing business, representing over 100% of revenue
• Depreciation is added back as a result of the large investment in its solar systems and ignores the expense as a negative drain on cash 


flow
• SEC Comment Letter shows evidence of aggressive use and calculation of EBITDA


 Contracted Customer Value (CCV) relies heavily on management assumptions to project 25+ year contracts when the Company only has 7 
years of historical data to back its model
• Based on Company data, we estimate every 1% change in the discount rate, results in $170 million change in CCV
• Auditor PWC has not audited or reviewed Sunnova’s CCV metric
• With so many variables, including life of service agreements, renewal and cancellation rates, production capacity and performance, 


hours of sun, required repairs, contracted electricity rates, discount rates, and more, how can this metric be predicted with confidence?


Financial Performance Continues To Decline As Growth Slows And Margins Erode; Highly Aggressive Inventory Accounting 
 As industry headwinds intensify, topline growth is slowing and reported margins have declined
 Reported gross margin excludes core interest expense required to fund its specialty finance business


• We calculate gross margin, which is extremely volatile and sometimes negative, significantly below reported margin (~60-70%)
 Gross margins also inflated relative to peers by two highly unusual industry practices


• Prepaid Inventory: NOVA’s prepaid inventory purchases at year end 2019 were 3x peers. We believe the tax benefit associated with these 
pre-purchases will artificially benefit margins and be a major headwind into 2021


• Inventory Accounting Method: NOVA uses the weighted average method vs. FIFO for peers. With input prices deflationary in nature, FIFO 
is the more conservative approach. NOVA’s method allows it to report higher margins than peers, all else equal


 Operating and free cash flow continue to decline as the business grows. We believe NOVA’s “Adjusted Operating Cash Flow” makes use of 
numerous aggressive and unsupported addbacks. They portray it as a positive result, but we believe it is deeply negative


 Sunnova relies on access to capital markets to support its unprofitable underlying business. As the balance sheet continues to grow, the 
economics of the business are stripped out by debt holders and tax equity investors, leaving equity shareholders with an overleveraged 
business dependent on management assumptions that will likely never generate cash flow for equity holders

Spruce Point Estimates 70% - 80% Downside 
($5.00 - $8.00/share) For NOVA


Corporate Governance Concerns And Insider Activity Should Worry Investors 
 Largest shareholder Energy Capital Partners (ECP) continues to liquidate its position, reducing by ~13% in July and ~24% in August


• ECP exited its investment in Sungevity, another residential solar company, three months before the Company filed bankruptcy 
 As the lockup expires, we believe insiders will follow ECP’s lead and be anxious to reduce their positions at today’s inflated valuation
 CEO Berger omits his experience at Enron, where he worked for 5 years, from his biography


• The Enron scandal involved booking mark-to-market earnings upfront on opaque financial models with assumptions that later proved inaccurate. 
This became known as mark-to-model accounting. We worry Sunnova’s non-GAAP metrics employ similarly aggressive interpretations


 CFO Robert Lane and VP of Finance Christian Hettick previously were executives at Spark Energy (SPKE), another energy company with a poor 
business model promoting high growth, which ended up collapsing


 CFO Lane also obscures his tenure from 2009-2011 at Madison Williams, a now bankrupt energy broker-dealer that was backed by Pan Asia China 
Commerce Corp (PAC3) and Fletcher International. Fletcher collapsed in 2012. The bankruptcy trustee said “in many ways, the fraud here has 
many of the characteristics of a Ponzi scheme”. The SEC later charged PAC3 with securities fraud in a film financing deal


 On September 25, 2020 Audit Chairman C. Park Shaper disclosed a 10b5-1 stock sale program effective August 24th
• Mr. Shaper came from Kinder Morgan, a Company formed by ex-Enron executives and has been criticized by some as a “house of cards”. 


During Mr. Shaper’s tenure as CFO of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners, it received an informal SEC probe into its acquisition accounting for 
Tejas Gas. Spruce Point observes that Tejas cost investors 18% more than initially proposed, resulting in goodwill ballooning from $0 to $152m


• Kinder Morgan paid $27.5m to settle a lawsuit that it misclassified expenses to inflate payouts during periods Mr. Shaper was Kinder’s President
 Executive compensation is not aligned with performance and metrics do not reflect those used by peers


• Compensation metrics include Adjusted EBITDA, adjusted operating cash flow and gross contracted value
• Sunnova’s peer group does not fairly represent its business by excluding specialty finance companies


 NOVA’s audit partner is an energy specialist, and not a financing specialist better suited for specialty finance companies
Significant Downside Risk As Market Perception Reevaluates Sunnova As A Specialty Finance Business
 Spruce Point arrives at our price target of $5.00 - $8.00 per share through a combination of a book value multiple reflecting the declining 


fundamentals of Sunnova’s business and a value per customer in line with solar peers
 Sunnova trades 16% below sell-side brokers’ consensus price target of $31 per share


• We believe these targets are overly optimistic as a result of using EBITDA and contracted customer value multiple methods
• Coverage by solar and energy analysts does not reflect the nature of Sunnova’s business. We believe coverage should be assigned to specialty 


finance analysts as is the case with leasing companies such as AerCap and Air Lease. 
 Sunrun’s acquisition of Vivint Solar provides a key data point to assess valuations in the industry. Sunnova trades at a premium to both peers on a 


revenue and customer basis, despite generating less revenue per customer and having a less diversified business
 We believe there is limited probability of an acquisition by Tesla/SolarCity as Tesla’s market share of the installation and financing market has 


declined since the acquisition

Specialty Finance Business, Not Solar


Sunnova’s website describes itself as a “leading residential solar and energy storage provider”; however, when 
speaking with a Sunnova customer service representative to inquire about solar panels, the agent blatantly admitted 


to being a financing company. 


“We do not install solar panels. We only provide the financing. You need to request 
a quote on Sunnova.com and one of our partners will reach out to you.”

Porter’s Five Forces Analysis


An industry executive highly familiar with Sunnova’s business model suggested that by evaluating Sunnova’s 
position with Porter’s Five Forces its positioning would be weak. We believe as the industry matures and competition 


increases, these factors will intensify and put additional pressure on Sunnova’s business. 


Source: Spruce Point analysis


Threat of New Entrants
- Financing companies can easily enter 


the solar financing business


- Cheap capital with current low interest 
rate environment 


- Off the shelf technology 


- Outsourced sales force


Threat of Substitutes
- Customers can refinance mortgage or 


borrow from a bank to finance the cost 
of installation


- As cost of installation declines, value of 
financing required for installation 
would decline, shrinking Sunnova’s 
addressable market


- State solar mandates requiring new 
construction homes to have solar 
systems would result in financing by 
mortgage rather than 3rd party


Bargaining Power of Customers
- Customers have high bargaining power 


as they make the ultimate decision and 
have a lot of different methods to 
purchase (Home Depot, Costco, 
catalog, etc.)


Bargaining Power of Suppliers
- Suppliers have high bargaining power 


as there are multiple players in the 
financing space and customers have 
multiple channels to purchase 
residential solar panels


Industry Rivalry
- Increasing as merger activity 


accelerating (i.e. Sunrun / Vivint Solar)


- Competition should intensify as solar 
market penetration grows and 
Companies are competition for each 
incremental customer


- Poor industry economics: high fixed 
costs, low variable costs, capacity 
enters market quickly and is sticky for 
the long run (once a customer is lost, 
the customer is lost for ~25 years due 
to the nature of the contract durations)
11


Sunnova’s Unique Metrics


We find Sunnova reports metrics that are not aligned with those its peers report. Spruce Point has concerns about the 
quality and relevance of these metrics including Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted Operating Expenses and Adjusted 


Operating Cash Flow. We believe investors should be concerned by the Company’s focus on these highly adjusted 
metrics that are not reported by Sunnova’s peers.

We Believe Adjusted EBITDA Is Not Where 
Investors Should Be Focused


According to a former Sunnova executive and other industry experts, Adjusted EBITDA is not the correct metric to 
evaluate the business and core earnings (interest income – interest expense – operating expenses) is a better metric. 


We believe the market may be incorrectly analyzing the performance of Sunnova’s business by using Adjusted 
EBITDA. In addition, a recent SEC Comment Letter shows evidence of aggressive use and calculation of Adjusted 


EBITDA.(1) We believe core earnings paints an accurate and different picture.


“No, it's not. What you'll see used is a traditional specialty finance company investment model 
where you use core earnings. All specialty finance companies and really all banks use core 
earnings.” 


“Core earnings takes all interest income, subtracts interest expense, subtracts operating 
expenses and then divides that by equity and that is what the core return on equity and that's 
how these businesses really get valued.”

Interest & Depreciation Expenses Are Core 
To NOVA’s Business


We believe the Company and investors should consider interest and depreciation as core operating expenses of 
Sunnova’s business. NOVA’s 10K states Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure core financial performance, while 


omitting core expenses of the Company’s business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, traditionally used as a proxy for 
operating cash flow, is not a fair representation of Sunnova’s operating cash flow. Using Adjusted EBITDA provides 


NOVA with the benefit of not accounting for true core operating expenses.


Source: Company filings, Spruce Point analysis


“We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management, investors and analysts in providing a measure of core financial performance adjusted to 
allow for comparisons of results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis. These adjustments are intended to exclude items 
that are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our management for internal 
planning purposes, including our consolidated operating budget, and by our Board in setting performance-based compensation targets.”


NOVA
2019 10K


Interest Expense Depreciation Expense


Current 
Method


The installation of these solar systems are primarily 
financed with debt, the interest is treated as traditional 


interest and not a core expense


Sunnova invests in solar systems, records the asset on 
its balance sheet and depreciates them over 35 years. 


As a result, this core expense is only recorded as an 
investing cash outflow


Spruce 
Point’s View


Interest expense is core to NOVA’s operating business, 
as the Company relies on debt to finance purchases of 


solar systems that are then leased to customers


Adding back interest expense associated with its leasing 
business artificially inflates the metric as a proxy for 


operating cash flow


Sunnova deflects investors from capex, instead focusing 
on adjusted operating cash flow. Capex is depreciated 


over time


Depreciation expense is added back to net loss on the 
basis that depreciation is a non-cash expense, however 


in NOVA’s case, it is a core operating expense. Using 
EBITDA as a proxy for operating cash flow ignores this 
true operating expense that is a negative drag on cash
14


Gross Margin Is Worse Than Appears


Not only is GAAP gross margin decreasing, but this metric does not show the complete picture of the Company’s true 
cost of revenue. Sunnova’s largest cost of revenue is the interest expense required to fund its financing business. By 
including interest expense in the calculation of gross margin, NOVA’s true gross margin is substantially lower than its 


GAAP gross margin and negative over many periods.

Spruce Point believes Sunnova’s adjusted operating cash flow is not reflective of the nature of Sunnova’s financing business.
We believe items such as dealer exclusivity payments and prepaid inventory should not be added back to cash flow as they are 


true operating costs of the business. In addition, Sunnova ignores financing transaction costs despite financing being core to its 
business. When adjusting for these items, Sunnova’s cash flow profile appears much worse than the Company reports.

Inventory Operating Cash Flow Adjustments 
Frequently Change, Undermine Confidence


Sunnova adds back “Inventory and Prepaid Inventory Purchases” to its adjusted operating cash flow. Spruce Point 
disagrees with this as: 1) None of Sunnova’s solar peers have reported inventory add-backs to operating cash flow, 


2) The Company provides no disclosure to its rationale for such an add-back, and 3) Since going public in July 2019, 
the Company has used four (4) different inventory line item disclosure classifications on its adjusted operating cash 


flow bridge. The table below illustrates these murky changes. We believe investors should have little confidence in the 
quality of Sunnova’s inventory adjustments and presentation of financials given such frequent changes. Notably, the 


inclusion of prepaid inventory provides Sunnova greater flexibility to increase Adjusted Operating Cash Flow by a 
material amount in 2019.

Spruce Point observes that Sunnova has engaged in a highly aggressive business practice related to prepaid 
inventory purchases which we believe has provided an unsustainable benefit to recent results. Sunnova added $96m 
of prepaid inventory at year end 2019 before the tax credit was reduced from 30% to 22%. This amount, relative to its 


LTM sales, is more than 3x its peers.

Aggressive Inventory Method Accounting


Spruce Point finds Sunnova’s use of the weighted-average method for inventory to be aggressive relative to Sunrun 
and Vivint Solar’s use of first-in-firs-out (FIFO). As the costs of solar systems inputs (PV modules, batteries, meters) 
decline overtime, the use of the weighted-average method lowers Sunnova’s cost of goods sold relative to its peers. 
This increases Sunnova’s near-term earnings and is another example of Sunnova’s aggressive accounting practices. 


Source: Company filings
19


Continuous Need To Raise Capital


Sunnova offers an undifferentiated business model that relies on access to capital markets to support its unprofitable 
underlying business. The Company generates negative operating cash flow, even before the negative adjustments for 


working capital. As Sunnova grows its topline revenue, its cash flow profile continues to worsen. As balance sheet 
leverage grows, the economics of the business are stripped out by the debt holders (through interest and debt 


payments) and tax equity holders (who gain from the favorable tax benefits solar investments offer). Sunnova is 
essentially a financial engineered platform that benefits debt holders and tax equity investors who receive all of any 


generated cash flows. In addition, management and early equity holders benefit as they are able to exit stakes at what 
we believe to be a currently inflated stock price. Long-term equity holders are last in line and look to be left with an 


overleveraged, cash draining business, highly dependent on management’s optimistic assumptions.

Major Shareholders Exiting Sunnova


Energy Capital Partners (ECP), an energy focused private equity and credit fund, is Sunnova’s largest shareholder, 
holding ~44% of shares outstanding in March. In July 2020, ECP sold 4.7 million shares or ~13% of its stake for $16.50 


per share, a 5.8% discount to NOVA’s closing price. On August 13th, 2020, Sunnova announced another secondary 
offering of 10 million shares at $25 per share, an 11% discount to NOVA’s closing price. Spruce Point projects the 


August sale will reduce ECP’s stake by 24%. Newlight Partners, Nova’s second largest shareholder previously 
representing over 11% of shares outstanding, sold 2.1 million shares on August 4th, a 21% decline in its position.

History Of Sunnova’s CEO


Sunnova was founded by William J. (John) Berger after he previously founded SunCap Financial, a residential solar 
service provider and Standard Renewable Energy, a provider and installer of renewable energy and energy-efficient 


products and services. According to his LinkedIn profile, Berger spent the first 5 years of his career at Enron until the 
firm collapsed in 2001. Berger was Director of Enron Energy Services, a division headed by Lou Pai. Pai has been 
referred to as Enron’s “invisible CEO” and one of the “brightest brains” at Enron who helped Jeffrey Skilling turn 


Enron into the fast-paced energy-trading firm it was before its collapse.(1) Berger’s biography on Sunnova’s website 
does not mention his stint at Enron, where he started his career and most likely received his formative education and 


training in business.

Cost Of Solar Is Becoming More Affordable


Since 2008, the cost of solar has declined ~60-70% according to multiple sources. The cost of an average-sized 
residential system dropped from over $50,000 in 2008 to ~$18,000 today. This decline in installation costs has fueled 


the recent solar industry growth. In addition, as installation costs decline less financing is needed per system 
installed.

Industry Trends Shift Away From Sunnova


As solar systems become more affordable, the industry is shifting from third-party ownership (leases and PPAs) to 
customer ownership with outright cash purchases and financing through loans. Customer ownership allows for 


individuals to capture a larger percentage of the economic savings previously captured by the independent financing 
companies (i.e. Sunnova), in turn, reducing demand for Sunnova’s key offerings.


Customer Ownership


- Customer owns the solar panels and receives the investment 
tax credit (ITC)


- By purchasing the system outright with cash there is no need 
for a financing party such as Sunnova to be involved 


- By financing a purchase with a loan the customer has 
multiple financing options (bank loan, credit card, etc.)


Purchase Outright Finance With Loan


3rd Party Ownership


Lease System
Power Purchase 
Agreement (PPA)


- Financing provider (i.e. Sunnova) owns the solar panels and 
receives the tax benefits 


- Under a lease, the customer leases the solar panels from the 
financing company


- Under a PPA, the customer purchases the power generated 
from the solar system at a predetermined price


Sunnova’s Core Business
96% of Sunnova’s revenue is tied to 3rd party 


ownership of solar systems


The residential solar industry is shifting away from 3rd party ownership
27


Decline Of Third-Party Ownership


A majority of the United States solar installation markets are experiencing a reduction in the percentage of third-party 
owned residential solar systems. We expect this trend to continue and favor solar loan providers. Wood Mackenzie 
expects a rush to customer-owned systems in the second half of 2020 ahead of another ITC stepdown to 21% at the 


end of the year.

Economics Support Cash Purchases & Loans


We believe in the long-run, customers should favor the purchase that allows them to capture the greatest financial 
savings, along with providing greater flexibility. While cash purchases provide the greatest long-term savings, 


customers are ahead of lease and PPA agreements from day 1 by financing with a loan. Sunnova has no competitive 
advantage, and actually could be at a disadvantage due to interest deductibility of home equity loans, relative to 


alternative financing options. We view loan purchases as the largest beneficiary of the lower interest rate 
environment.

Lower Mortgage Rates & Higher Home Values 
Make Home Equity Loans More Appealing


With mortgage rates near all time lows and home values rising, we believe rising home equity levels will allow 
homeowners an attractive method to purchase solar systems by tapping into the increased value of their home equity. 


Financing by loan allows customers to benefit from the tax deductibility of interest. This should pose a threat to 
Sunnova’s lease dependent business.

Maximize The Financial Benefit


It is clear that online sources suggest customers purchase solar panels outright to realize the largest financial 
savings. While solar energy is an ecofriendly solution, we believe that most customers are motivated by another form 


of “green” savings, cash, and will continue to shift to outright purchases and loans.

Shift To Outright Purchases


As the cost of installation has fallen over the past few years, the trend towards outright ownership has grown. In 2017, 
this trend along with other industry headwinds resulted in Sungevity filling bankruptcy.


“More than half of U.S. homeowners now buy their panels with cash or a loan, rather than sign a lease or power purchase agreement, 
up from 38% of home installations in 2015.”


“Solar firms that offer leases—like SolarCity and Vivint—need to keep adding customers and installing new panels at a fast pace, since their 
business model relies on bundling leases together and selling shares to banks and other investors.


“You need to support the volume to attract the capital,” said David Field, chief executive of OneRoof Energy Inc., a solar firm that is in the 
process of liquidating after it ran out of money late last year. “You find yourself in a vicious cycle.””


“The smaller installers that have been gaining market share at bigger players’ expense have lower overhead costs because they don’t 
employ big sales forces and let others provide financing to their customers. They also offer low-cost loans.


Solar Mosaic Inc. joins with local installers and offers solar-panel loans to homeowners. Mosaic then packages the loans and sells them to 
banks, insurance companies and other investors.


The company started out making loans for customers of local and regional installers, but it now offers loans to SolarCity and Vivint 
customers as well.


“There has been a shift in customer preference for loans” rather than leases, Mosaic Chief Executive Billy Parish said.”

Shift From Leases & PPAs To Loans


For those customers unable to purchase outright, there is a shift towards loans from leases and PPA agreements. 
Within the solar loan market, Sunnova faces significant competition from existing players, new entrants and 


traditional financing solutions looking to grow share of solar loans. Another trend of smaller installers growing share 
is contributing to the growth of solar loans over third-party ownership. We believe that although third-party ownership 


will not disappear as the market continues to shift towards loans, companies such as Sunnova that rely heavily on 
volume and economics of third-party ownership will be negatively affected.

Transition To Loans Would Cannibalize 
SREC Revenue Stream


Assuming Sunnova is forced to follow the industry trend and loans become a larger share of the Company’s solar 
deployments, Sunnova would lose its highly profitable solar renewable energy certificate (SREC) revenue stream. 
SRECs are a form of government incentive generated for each megawatt of electricity produced by a solar energy 


system and are sold to electric utility companies who are required to meet government regulated renewable portfolio 
standards. As SRECs can be sold with or without the associated electricity, it has potential to generate high margins 
for the seller (i.e. Sunnova). Since Sunnova does not own the solar system under a loan agreement, the Company is 
unable to generate the level of revenue from selling SRECs, further impacting the economics of Sunnova’s business 


model. Spruce Point believes this high margin revenue stream is at risk of almost entirely disappearing.

Loss Of Tax Credits Hurts Economics 


Without the renewal of the current 30% Federal Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for the construction of residential solar 
systems, the underlying economics of the solar leases and PPAs would deteriorate as the level of the ITC drops from 


30% to 22% in 2021 and 0% in 2022 (10% for commercial). This hurts the economics of Sunnova’s business which 
relies heavily on capital from tax equity investors. We believe there are multiple outcomes, all of which are negative 


for Sunnova, regardless if an extension to the solar ITCs were to occur.

Margins Highly Dependent On Regulation


We estimate gross profit per system will continue to drop as the solar investment tax credit steps down over the next 
2 years. Lower margins and a reduced benefit for tax equity investors look to pressure an industry which already has 


tight margins and relies on tax equity to support their negative cash flows.

Miscalculating Probability Of ITC Extension


Spruce Point believes the recent rise in solar stocks is due to the assumption of a change in Washington D.C. and 
favorable benefit to the solar industry from a potential Biden administration’s policy. Our research has shown mixed 
views, and nothing showing total certainty, on the possibility of an extension to the solar tax credits. According to 
Sunrun, a 4% reduction in costs and 2% increase in prices would be required to offset the loss from a runoff in the 


ITC. In a highly competitive industry where all players compete for each incremental customer, we find it unlikely for 
companies to pass through increased costs.

“You're really in 50/50 land on the federal investment tax credit being extended. I'd say as of March or April people had sort of a 10% 
level of competence in the tax credit getting extended. The people in my network, I'm hearing more of mixed optimism. I'd say that you 
do get another Hail Mary like we got four years. Nobody expected the tax credit to get renewed four years ago. From what our 
regulatory team told us, it was a last item on the docket before everybody adjourned.
I'm on the 50 that says, I don't think it gets renewed. If you add a broader audience, I think you're going to find a lot of people that do 
believe it will get accepted. And what I would say is, is if Biden’s elected, I get a lot more optimistic about it. If Biden gets elected, I think 
maybe then you got a 50/50 shot and I still don’t think it gets extended.”

“Biden announced the $2 trillion policy and I think people are assuming that’s going to directly benefit those companies and it probably 
will, but getting that implemented is going to be challenging. I think a lot of what the focus will be under a Biden administration will 
be offshore wind and energy efficiency. Putting a carbon tax or some sort of carbon mechanism in place to address this.”


Former 
Sunnova 
Executive


“We would need to do to maintain neutrality on that is to improve costs by about 4% every year and raise pricing by about 2% each 
year. And so we think that's incredibly doable. So that and not only envisions solar. So it doesn't necessarily envision the fact that 
consumers are willing to pay even more money to add the battery, and that there's also additional sources of value that can come from 
the grid services type programs for the battery. So putting that aside, we think we're well on the path to be able to absorb those 
declines and have the competitive advantage. At our scale, right now, we have safe harbor, I believe, more megawatts than any other 
company. There's no reason why we won't be able to continue to do that. So that should be a margin that we're able to capture 
uniquely.”

Porter’s Five Forces Analysis


An industry executive highly familiar with Sunnova’s business model suggested that by evaluating Sunnova’s 
position with Porter’s Five Forces its positioning would be weak. We believe as the industry matures and competition 


increases, these factors will intensify and put additional pressure on Sunnova’s business. 


Source: Spruce Point analysis


Threat of New Entrants
- Financing companies can easily enter 


the solar financing business


- Cheap capital with current low interest 
rate environment 


- Off the shelf technology 


- Outsourced sales force


Threat of Substitutes
- Customers can refinance mortgage or 


borrow from a bank to finance the cost 
of installation


- As cost of installation declines, value of 
financing required for installation 
would decline, shrinking Sunnova’s 
addressable market


- State solar mandates requiring new 
construction homes to have solar 
systems would result in financing by 
mortgage rather than 3rd party


Bargaining Power of Customers
- Customers have high bargaining power 


as they make the ultimate decision and 
have a lot of different methods to 
purchase (Home Depot, Costco, 
catalog, etc.)


Bargaining Power of Suppliers
- Suppliers have high bargaining power 


as there are multiple players in the 
financing space and customers have 
multiple channels to purchase 
residential solar panels


Industry Rivalry
- Increasing as merger activity 


accelerating (i.e. Sunrun / Vivint Solar)


- Competition should intensify as solar 
market penetration grows and 
Companies are competition for each 
incremental customer


- Poor industry economics: high fixed 
costs, low variable costs, capacity 
enters market quickly and is sticky for 
the long run (once a customer is lost, 
the customer is lost for ~25 years due 
to the nature of the contract durations)

Small Player In A Competitive Industry


In July 2020, Sunrun announced the acquisition of Vivint Solar, creating the largest player in the industry on a pro 
forma basis. The transaction is intended to result in cost synergies and the combination of complementary direct-to-
home sales channels. As a result, Sunrun may be able to compete more aggressively for new customers, therefore 
increasing pressure on Sunnova and smaller players. On Sunrun’s M&A call, the CEO first mentions capital costs, 
reinforcing our belief that it is the main driver of success in the solar financing industry. Spruce Point believes the 
need for cost driven mergers, rather than revenue driven synergies, is a bearish sign of the competitive pressure in 


the industry.

Cumulative Directly Financed Installed Solar Capacity (2012 – Q1 2020)


“As the industry leader, Sunrun has enjoyed capital cost advantages. By joining arms with Vivint Solar, we expect to further our
advantages in 2 ways. First, we'll be even more regular issuers of debt securities, which should drive down our capital costs. And 
second, with our combined size, we will more easily appeal to investors with enormous minimum check sizes, such as pension 
funds, who often enjoy a lower cost of capital. Over time, these advantages will benefit our customers and shareholders, while 
allowing us to accelerate the adoption of affordable, renewable energy.”

Competition To Intensify As SunPower 
Expands Residential Solar Lease Business


SunPower, a Sunnova competitor, continues to expand its financial backing to offer customers attractive solar leasing 
options. Spruce Point believes competition will continue to intensify, further pressuring Sunnova to grow and 


maintain its current market share. We believe Sunnova’s undifferentiated offerings make the Company ill-positioned to 
compete with diversified solar companies. 


SunPower Press Release – September 22, 2020


“Our lease financing team inside SunPower 
has been very actively working on 
improving our lease offering as 
well. We're just a few days away from 
announcing a significant addition to 
our lease portfolio, which takes funding 
well through 2021. Most importantly, it 
doesn't just provide great lease capability 
to customers and our dealer partners, this 
technology actually increased our gross 
margins over $0.40 a watt. I would say 
this is one of the areas since we became 
much more focused on the space that has 
really improved our fundamental 
financials as a company. Advances in 
financing are playing a big part in driving 
our increased profitability, but also our 
increased dealer loyalty.”

Value Proposition Is Not Differentiating 


Sunnova sells its investors on “A Differentiated Ecosystem” built on customer relationships, asset ownership and a 
network of local dealers. This “story stock” requires continued financing to raise capital necessary to remain afloat. In 
reality, Sunnova is a legacy residential solar financing provider with undifferentiated offerings (leases, PPAs, loans).

Downsides Of Dealer Model


As a residential solar financing company, Sunnova provides commodity products and competes with numerous 
providers for installer relationships. Given the unfavorable economics of the financing business and high fixed costs, 


companies are incentivized to compete for each additional contract while dealers are incentivized to reward the 
financing partner where they receive the highest compensation. Unlike many of its competitors, Sunnova operates 


exclusively through independent dealers for both customer acquisition and installation. As of June 2020, the 
Company has 227 dealers in its network, but Trinity Solar accounts for greater than 30% of originations. As part of an 
exclusivity agreement with Trinity Solar, Sunnova paid Trinity $20 million in the first year and will pay $10 million in 
each year thereafter. Sunnova enters into similar agreements with other dealers. Essentially, Sunnova is purchasing 


future origination volume. While this model reduces sales and marketing expenses, it creates significant risks.

“The salesperson is controlling the customer, it’s a tabletop sale. You know that salesperson is going to direct that sale to 
the residential solar financing company that pays them highest price. Yeah. There's no differentiation either, even the 
colors are the same. Just to prove it to yourself, get a copy of Sunnova’s contracts and compare that to SolarCity’s. There's just 
not that much different. The salespeople want to maximize their gain and they'll sell that contract to the highest bidder.”


Former 
Sunnova 
Employee


”I think if people look, Sunnova discloses to be paying exclusivity payments to channel partners. So in order to prevent the 
channel partner from shifting the volume to other players and bidding it out fluidly, they have been making advanced 
payments to these channel partners to secure volume, which is important and is prudent in the sense that if you don't have 
the volume you can't get scale. I think it's a good idea, but it's diluted to the equity of the business because you're buying the 
volume. It just means you're just paying an advanced payment to lock it up. But the next time, that goes on for a year, and 
next year I guarantee you that channel partner is going to be talking to Sunrun, SolarCity and a couple of the other players 
out there to see if they can get the same deal.


They're just bidding. They're just bidding the volume, probably the way it evolves is there's an intermediary services that helps 
customers bid this out to get the best price. Kind of like bankrate.com. You out in your parameters and they get you the 
cheapest rate. Its very capital light and gives customers what they need.”

Exclusivity Agreements Raise Concerns


Sunnova’s exclusivity agreements limit Sunnova while providing upside for its partners. We believe Sunnova is forced 
to pay “exclusivity bonuses” to secure volumes for its undifferentiated financing services. Sunnova pays partners to 
send them its leads when in turn, we believe if Sunnova provided any value, Sunnova should be the party receiving 


exclusivity payments from partners. 


Source: Earnings call transcripts


We question why Sunnova would be paying “exclusivity bonuses” to its channel partners who are not limited to using Sunnova’s 
financing solutions? Sunnova is required to send all its leads in a given geography while partners (i.e. Trinity Solar, one of Sunnova’s 


largest partners) are not required to use Sunnova financing for its customers.


“So it's really a benefit to Trinity, not to Sunnova. It's very easy to give for Trinity. It's very easy to get a Sunnova exclusive.“Industry Executive


“We mostly provide financing through Sunnova, but can also offer Sunrun, Sunlight and other financing providers.”ManagerTrinity Solar


“What did come as a surprise that we recently had our dealers summit, and this was something that was a pretty strong feedback. I 
think, look, we're adding a lot of operational capabilities to the company. And then, again, looking at our widest product portfolio, there 
really isn't a need. And certainly, there is a desire to cut costs by the dealers to just plug in again to one service platform. Our strong 
financial position, relationships, we've proven that we're focused on the dealer and the customer and service. So all that comes together 
is that dealers are looking to find a home. They want to be able to pick up the phone, talk to senior management if need be because 
things do happen on both sides of the relationship, and they know we're totally focused on them. And so that is giving a lot more comfort 
to folks, and you're seeing a lot of dealers talks amongst each other that are not yet Sunnova dealers and saying, you know what, you 
need to come over here. This is home. This is the place you want to be. This is where you can build your business over the long term.”

Sunrun Cautious Of Independent Dealers


Sunrun, one of Sunnova’s largest competitors and a market leader of solar installations, relies on in-house installation 
teams. Sunrun’s CEO states that independent dealers hurt the economics of the business and prevent the highest 


level of long-term value to customers. Both Sunrun and Vivint Solar believe that the direct selling model will 
experience faster growth than dealer channels and is best positioned in the current market environment. 


“As always, we are focused on the building the industry's most valuable and satisfied customer base. We maintain discipline on 
unit-level economics and deliver long-term value to our customers. This is why we've achieved our market-leading position, 
and we intend to keep it. We don't compete with dealer-only businesses who lack the capability to ensure a positive customer 
experience and who pay unsustainable prices. We are exercising caution around the industry's recent acceleration of the 
direct selling or door-to-door sales channels through independent sales dealers. I want to be very clear that this is an 
important acquisition channel, but it needs to have controls in management to prohibit aggressive practices that won't serve 
customers or investors over the long run. The customer acquisition channels, including retail that we serve with our 
salespeople are growing over 20% and will be durable and provide cost reductions over time.”

Dealer Counterparty Risk


Sunnova faces significant counterparty risk from its dealers, who are paid in milestones, usually at contract

be unable to reimburse the Company for millions of dollars in upfront payments. In June 2020, PetersenDean, a

major partner of Sunnova at the time. According to Code Green’s CEO, 94% of solar arrays were built with Sunnova. In 
May 2019, Code Green Solar CEO Charles Kartsaklis pleaded guilty to wire fraud and defrauding the U.S. Treasury

Maximo Solar Industries (MSI), a Sunnova channel partner in Puerto Rico, sued Sunnova alleging abusive business 
practices that forced half a dozen solar installers to close. The allegations included withholding payment for 


installation services, resulting in the insolvency of six installation companies. 
In addition, Sunnova’s installer network exposed the Company to significant risk using potentially predatory and 


deceptive sales practices that led to a government investigation and legal dispute with one of Puerto Rico’s largest 
installers. 436 consumers filed a complaint with the Puerto Rico Energy Bureau (NEPR). As a result of the problems in

Where Should Investors Focus?


Given Sunnova’s poor underlying financial performance and poor cash flow profile, we believe management is 
attempting to shift investors focus to positive reported Adjusted EBITDA and growth of contracted customer value 


(CCV). Spruce Point believes investors should place little, if any, confidence in these metrics as Adjusted EBITDA is 
not an accurate representation of Sunnova’s business and CCV relies heavily on management’s assumptions.

significant increases year-over-year, and this 


translates directly into shareholder value creation.”
- William Berger, CEO (Q2 2020 Earnings Call)


Spruce 
Point’s 
View


We believe this is an inaccurate measure.
EBITDA is not the correct metric for a specialty 


finance business as it excludes core expenses of 
interest and depreciation


Metric relies heavily on various management 
assumptions (life of service agreements, renewal 
and cancellation rates, production capacity and 


performance, hours of sun, required repairs, 
contracted electricity rates, discount rates) to 
project value of 25+ year contacts when the 


Company only has 7 years of historical data to 
create its model
53


We Believe Adjusted EBITDA Is Not Where 
Investors Should Be Focused


According to a former Sunnova executive and other industry experts, Adjusted EBITDA is not the correct metric to 
evaluate the business and core earnings (interest income – interest expense – operating expenses) is a better metric. 


We believe the market may be incorrectly analyzing the performance of Sunnova’s business by using Adjusted 
EBITDA. In addition, a recent SEC Comment Letter shows evidence of aggressive use and calculation of Adjusted 


EBITDA(1). We believe core earnings paints an accurate and different picture.


“No, it's not. What you'll see used is a traditional specialty finance company investment model 
where you use core earnings. All specialty finance companies and really all banks use core 
earnings.” 


“Core earnings takes all interest income, subtracts interest expense, subtracts operating 
expenses and then divides that by equity and that is what the core return on equity and that's 
how these businesses really get valued.”

We Believe Adjusted EBITDA Appears 
Misleading


Sunnova points investors to Adjusted EBITDA as a key metric to evaluate financial performance, while key public 
competitors Sunrun and Vivint Solar do not report EBITDA. Spruce Point believes EBITDA does not accurately reflect 
Sunnova’s financial performance and paints an overly optimistic picture of the business. As Sunnova’s operating and 


cash flow before financing continues to decline, Adjusted EBITDA remains flat.

Interest & Depreciation Exceed Revenue


While Sunnova presents Adjusted EBITDA to investors, treating interest and depreciation as non-core expenses, 
interest plus depreciation exceeds the Company revenue. Sunnova, a cash-burning, capital insensitive business 


becomes profitable on an “Adjusted EBITDA” basis.

Interest & Depreciation Expenses Are Core 
To NOVA’s Business


We believe the Company and investors should consider interest and depreciation as core operating expenses of 
Sunnova’s business. NOVA’s 10K states Adjusted EBITDA is useful to measure core financial performance, while 


omitting core expenses of the Company’s business. We believe Adjusted EBITDA, traditionally used as a proxy for 
operating cash flow, is not a fair representation of Sunnova’s operating cash flow. Using Adjusted EBITDA provides 


NOVA with the benefit of not accounting for true core operating expenses.


Source: Company filings, Spruce Point analysis


“We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to management, investors and analysts in providing a measure of core financial performance adjusted to 
allow for comparisons of results of operations across reporting periods on a consistent basis. These adjustments are intended to exclude items 
that are not indicative of the ongoing operating performance of the business. Adjusted EBITDA is also used by our management for internal 
planning purposes, including our consolidated operating budget, and by our Board in setting performance-based compensation targets.”

Interest Expense Depreciation Expense


Current 
Method


The installation of these solar systems are primarily 
financed with debt, the interest is treated as traditional 


interest and not a core expense


Sunnova invests in solar systems, records the asset on 
its balance sheet and depreciates them over 35 years. 


As a result, this core expense is only recorded as an 
investing cash outflow


Spruce 
Point’s View


Interest expense is core to NOVA’s operating business, 
as the Company relies on debt to finance purchases of 


solar systems that are then leased to customers


Adding back interest expense associated with its leasing 
business artificially inflates the metric as a proxy for 


operating cash flow


Sunnova deflects investors from capex, instead focusing 
on adjusted operating cash flow. Capex is depreciated 


over time


Depreciation expense is added back to net loss on the 
basis that depreciation is a non-cash expense, however 


in NOVA’s case, it is a core operating expense. Using 
EBITDA as a proxy for operating cash flow ignores this 
true operating expense that is a negative drag on cash
57


Core Earnings Show An Accurate Picture 


We believe core earnings is a more accurate metric to measure the financial performance of a specialty finance 
business. Sunnova’s core earnings have continued to decline, and we believe it is unlikely NOVA will ever be able to 


maintain a sustained level of profitability.

Contracted Customer Value


Net Contracted Customer Value is the difference between the total lifetime value of installed solar projects (leases, 
PPAs and loans) and the costs (debt and tax equity) needed to finance those projects. It is important to note given 


Sunnova was founded in 2013, the Company only has 7 years of data to estimate the performance of 25 year 
contracts.

Net Contracted Customer Value is a function of:

- Cancellation rates
- Default rates
- Production capacity and performance of the 


solar equipment installed
- Expected sun hours
- Retail price of utility-generated electricity
- Required repairs and maintenance
- Contracted electricity rates
- Operating and administrative expenses
- Availability of debt and tax equity financing
- Long-term interest rates and level of inflation
- Cost of debt
- Cost of equity
- Proper discount rates
- Changes in regulation, etc.


How can Sunnova accurately project Gross Contracted Customer Value with any certainty given the number of variables and limited 
amount of data over the past 7 years?


Contracted Customer Value Calculation
59


Contracted Customer Value


Management presents Gross and Net Contracted Customer Value (CCV) as a key metric to evaluate Sunnova. As seen 
in the Company’s investor presentation, a slight change in the discount rate from 6% to 4% results in a $340 million 


difference to Gross and Net CCV (a ~15% and ~40% difference). With such slight changes to numerous assumptions, 
how can this metric be predicted with any confidence?

Auditor Does Not Sign Off On Metric


Source: S-1 filing


In Spruce Point’s experience, it is unusual for a Company to disclaim that an auditor has not reviewed or audited non-
GAAP operational metrics outside of the financial statements. According to the Company’s risk factor disclosure, PwC 
has not audited or reviewed Sunnova’s Contracted Customer Value metric. Spruce Point believes investors should be 


concerned by a possible lack of confidence in this crucial performance metric by auditor.

61


Gross Margin Is Worse Than Appears


Not only is GAAP gross margin decreasing, but this metric does not show the complete picture of the Company’s true 
cost of revenue. Sunnova’s largest cost of revenue is the interest expense required to fund its financing business. By 
including interest expense in the calculation of gross margin, NOVA’s true gross margin is substantially lower than its 


GAAP gross margin and negative over many periods.

Spruce Point believes Sunnova’s adjusted operating cash flow is not reflective of the nature of Sunnova’s financing business.
We believe items such as dealer exclusivity payments and prepaid inventory should not be added back to cash flow as they are 


true operating costs of the business. In addition, Sunnova ignores financing transaction costs despite financing being core to its 
business. When adjusting for these items, Sunnova’s cash flow profile appears much worse than the Company reports.
63


Inventory Operating Cash Flow Adjustments 
Frequently Change, Undermine Confidence


Sunnova adds back “Inventory and Prepaid Inventory Purchases” to its adjusted operating cash flow. Spruce Point 
disagrees with this as: 1) None of Sunnova’s solar peers have reported inventory add-backs to operating cash flow, 


2) The Company provides no disclosure to its rationale for such an add-back, and 3) Since going public in July 2019, 
the Company has used four (4) different inventory line item disclosure classifications on its adjusted operating cash 


flow bridge. The table below illustrates these murky changes. We believe investors should have little confidence in the 
quality of Sunnova’s inventory adjustments and presentation of financials given such frequent changes. Notably, the 


inclusion of prepaid inventory provides Sunnova greater flexibility to increase Adjusted Operating Cash Flow by a 
material amount in 2019.

Spruce Point observes that Sunnova has engaged in a highly aggressive business practice related to prepaid 
inventory purchases which we believe has provided an unsustainable benefit to recent results. Sunnova added $96m 
of prepaid inventory at year end 2019 before the tax credit was reduced from 30% to 22%. This amount, relative to its 


LTM sales, is more than 3x its peers. 


Source: Company filings
65


Aggressive Inventory Method Accounting


Spruce Point finds Sunnova’s use of the weighted-average method for inventory to be aggressive relative to Sunrun 
and Vivint Solar’s use of first-in-firs-out (FIFO). As the costs of solar systems inputs (PV modules, batteries, meters) 
decline overtime, the use of the weighted-average method lowers Sunnova’s cost of goods sold relative to its peers. 
This increases Sunnova’s near-term earnings and is another example of Sunnova’s aggressive accounting practices.

Poor Underlying Performance
67


Revenue Growth Decelerating


We observe slowing reported revenue growth as the solar financing market remains highly competitive with little 
differentiation between companies’ offerings. Sunnova is not immune from the industry pressure and the recent cost 
driven Sunrun / Vivint Solar deal signals lower future revenue growth. Despite Y-o-Y revenue growth in Q2 2020, YTD 


revenue growth follows the greater trend, down from 35% to ~26% Y-o-Y.

While Q2 2020 revenue was up Y-o-Y, we believe this was

68


Margins Worsening


As GAAP gross margins have declined, the Company’s poor financial performance is shown by its negative operating 
and net margins. However, the Company’s non-GAAP adjustments create the illusion of Sunnova being a profitable 


business with high Adjusted EBITDA margins.

GAAP Margins Adjusted Margins

Continuous Need To Raise Capital


Sunnova offers an undifferentiated business model that relies on access to capital markets to support its unprofitable 
underlying business. The Company generates negative operating cash flow, even before the negative adjustments for 


working capital. As Sunnova grows its topline revenue, its cash flow profile continues to worsen. As balance sheet 
leverage grows, the economics of the business are stripped out by the debt holders (through interest and debt 


payments) and tax equity holders (who gain from the favorable tax benefits solar investments offer). Sunnova is 
essentially a financial engineered platform that benefits debt holders and tax equity investors who receive all of any 


generated cash flows. In addition, management and early equity holders benefit as they are able to exit stakes at what 
we believe to be a currently inflated stock price. Long-term equity holders are last in line and look to be left with an 


overleveraged, cash draining business, highly dependent on management’s optimistic assumptions.

Major Shareholders Exiting Sunnova


Energy Capital Partners (ECP), an energy focused private equity and credit fund, is Sunnova’s largest shareholder, 
holding ~44% of shares outstanding in March. In July 2020, ECP sold 4.7 million shares or ~13% of its stake for $16.50 


per share, a 5.8% discount to NOVA’s closing price. On August 13th, 2020, Sunnova announced another secondary 
offering of 10 million shares at $25 per share, an 11% discount to NOVA’s closing price. Spruce Point projects the 


August sale will reduce ECP’s stake by 24%. Newlight Partners, Nova’s second largest shareholder previously 
representing over 11% of shares outstanding, sold 2.1 million shares on August 4th, a 21% decline in its position.

Selling Should Accelerate As Lockup Expires


As Sunnova’s lockup expires, Spruce Point believes insiders will be anxious to reduce their positions at today’s 
inflated valuation. We have already seen the beginning of this as Energy Capital Partners continues reducing the size 
of its position. A former Sunnova executive told us he believes Sunnova is “very expensive” on a free cash flow and 


relative valuation basis.


“It feels very expensive to me. If you go through the three 
methodologies, valuing the cash flows, on a relative value 
basis and the third thing is what its worth on a price to book 
basis if you were to think about it as a financing company. 
In all three metrics, it's quite expensive.”

History Of Sunnova’s CEO


Sunnova was founded by William J. (John) Berger after he previously founded SunCap Financial, a residential solar 
service provider and Standard Renewable Energy, a provider and installer of renewable energy and energy-efficient 


products and services. According to his LinkedIn profile, Berger spent the first 5 years of his career at Enron until the 
firm collapsed in 2001. Berger was Director of Enron Energy Services, a division headed by Lou Pai. Pai has been 
referred to as Enron’s “invisible CEO” and one of the “brightest brains” at Enron who helped Jeffrey Skilling turn 


Enron into the fast-paced energy-trading firm it was before its collapse.(1) Berger’s biography on Sunnova’s website 
does not mention his stint at Enron, where he started his career and most likely received his formative education and 


training in business.

Audit Chair With History At Kinder Morgan, 
Begins To Sell Shares


On Friday September 25th, 2020, Audit Chairman C. Park Shaper disclosed a 10b-1 sock sale program effective August 
24th. Mr. Shaper came from Kinder Morgan, a Company formed by ex-Enron executives and has been criticized by 
some as a “house of cards”.(1) While Mr. Shaper was President of various Kinder Morgan entities, a lawsuit was 


brought, and settled, that Kinder Morgan improperly shifted expenses to inflate payout to itself. In addition, during 
Mr. Shaper’s tenure as CFO, Kinder Morgan Energy partners received an informal SEC probe into its acquisition 


accounting for Tejas Gas. Spruce Point observes Kinder Morgan reshuffled the purchase price allocation three (3) 
times and Tejas cost investors 18% more than its initial $750m purchase price, due in part to escalating liabilities. 


Goodwill ascribed to the transaction ballooned from $0 to $152 million. No SEC charges were ever brought.

Finance Executives’ Time At Spark Energy


Sunnova’s CFO and VP of Finance previously were executives at Spark Energy, another energy company with a poor 
business model promoting high growth, which ended up collapsing. Spark touted its sophisticated customer 


acquisition model and “customer lifetime value strategy.” Spark had a history of regulatory issues(1,2) under CFO 
Robert Lane’s leadership. Spark’s shares fell ~40% during Lane’s tenure as CFO and fell as much as 75% from its all-


time high in June 2017.

CFO’s Obscured Role At Madison Williams, Backed

Sunnova’s CFO Robert Lane SEC-filed and public biography excludes explicit mention of his tenure as a Managing 
Director at Madison Williams and Company (2009-2011), a spin off from Sanders Morris Harris (Nasdaq: SMHG). 


Madison Williams was backed by two dubious investors: Pan Asia China Commerce Corp (PAC3) and Fletcher Asset 
Management.(1) Fletcher Asset Management, was described as having characteristics of a Ponzi scheme, and filed for 


bankruptcy protection in June 2012.(2) In August 2016, the SEC filed fraud charges against PAC3 in a film financing 
scheme.(3) Madison Williams ultimately filed for bankruptcy protection in December 2011.

Concerns With Executive Compensation Plan


Spruce Point is concerned by 1) the selected peer group which does not include leasing companies, and 2) the 
metrics used to evaluate executive compensation. While Sunnova limits its peers to “larger solar and renewable 
energy companies,” competitor Sunrun includes leasing companies in its compensation evaluation. ISS assigns 


Sunnova’s compensation with a Governance QualityScore of 9 (lower risk=1, higher risk=10).

Peers & Compensation Metrics Not Relevant


While Spruce Point does not agree with Sunnova’s selected peers, none of the peers use Adjusted EBITDA or adjusted 
operating cash flow as a metric for compensation.

Sunrun’s Proxy Peer Group


Spruce Point believes Sunrun’s inclusion of financing companies in its peer set is appropriate to represent the 
financing and leasing aspect of Sunrun’s diversified solar business. We believe these peers are more relevant for 


Sunnova’s pure financing/leasing business.

Audit Partner Is An Energy Specialist


Sunnova’s current audit partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers is Rahul Sood, a Partner in the firm’s Energy & Utilities 
practice. We believe Mr. Sood’s expertise is not relevant and PwC should assign an audit partner with specialty 


finance/leasing experience.

Need For Financial Services Expertise


We find many leasing companies’ audit partners to have specialty finance/leasing related experience, relevant to 
Sunnova’s business model. AerCap Holdings (audited by PwC) and Air Lease Corp, two leasing companies, have audit 


partners with financial services experience.

Perplexing Relative Valuation


Sunnova’s business model aligns itself closer to specialty finance / leasing peers than solar businesses. Despite its 
undifferentiated offerings and lagging financial metrics, Sunnova trades at a premium to peers across all metrics. 


Spruce Point believes it is only a matter of time until Sunnova’s growth contracts inline with industry peers.

Sunrun / Vivint Solar Deal Valuation


Sunrun’s acquisition of Vivint Solar provides a key data point to assess valuations in the solar industry. While 
Sunnova generates less revenue per customer than Sunrun and Vivint Solar, its valuation is substantially higher. After 
the deal announcement, Vivint traded at 9.4x and 8.9x 2020E and 2021E revenues, while Sunnova traded at 23.7x and 
19.4x. We believe the Vivint deal is evidence Sunnova is trading at an extremely frothy valuation relative to its more 


diversified residential solar peers that is not justified by its performance.

Goldman Sachs – July 30th, 2020


We have presented our belief, supported by interviews with former executives, that EBITDA in not an appropriate 
metric to analyze Sunnova. Despite this, the sell-side chooses to focus on EBITDA to evaluate NOVA’s financial 


performance and valuation.
88


Estimated Customer Value Multiple


Variations of estimated customer value used by analysts heavily rely on the Company’s long-term, optimistic 
assumptions. This metric essentially puts investors’ faith in the Company’s model, upon which the auditor disclaims 


any level of assurance.

Roth Capital – July 31, 2020


As a result of this unreliable 
valuation method, Roth 


Capital has the 2nd highest 
price target for Sunnova


Incorrectly adjusts for

Flawed Methodology Results In Inflated 
Price Targets


Wall Street analysts primarily use a combination of EBITDA multiple and estimated customer value to assign a price target 
for Sunnova. We believe EBITDA is the incorrect metric for the Company and estimated customer value is calculated with 
numerous unpredictable assumptions. Regardless, relative to its solar peers, Sunnova appears overvalued on a revenue 


and EBITDA multiple basis. We believe neither of these methodologies are appropriate for a financing business like 
Sunnova and a price-to-book multiple is most relevant.

None Of The Analysts With The Highest 
Price Targets Cover Leasing Businesses


Spruce Point believes Sunnova’s sell-side coverage is unsatisfactory and a result of the misalignment between 
Sunnova’s leasing business and analysts’ coverage of the solar and alternative energy sectors. We believe it is a 


major concern that none of the analysts cover other leasing businesses.

Limited Probability Of Acquisition


Given Sunnova’s sky high valuation, we believe that is would be a large pill to swallow for any potential acquirer. 
Since Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016, it appears the residential solar installation business has not been a priority for 


Tesla as SolarCity’s share of the installation and financing market has plummeted. Given Sunrun’s recently 
announced acquisition of Vivint Solar, we believe at the moment it is very unlikely for Sunrun to pursue an acquisition 


of Sunnova. With Sunnova’s largest investor selling shares, it is a good signal that any large transformational 
acquisition is not a near term catalyst. Spruce Point believes if Sunnova participates in any M&A activity, it would 


likely be the acquisition of smaller players.
