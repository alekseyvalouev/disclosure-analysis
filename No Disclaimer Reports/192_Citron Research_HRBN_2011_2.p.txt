“THAT’S MY STORY AND I’M
STICKIN’ TO IT”


Citron issues further commentary on Harbin


Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN)


At the risk of overstating the obvious, Chinese stocks
have fallen out of favor fast with US Investors.  And for
good reason. 


  What's New?


A lot of things have changed since Harbin’s elusive $24
per share buyout o�er was �oated eight months ago. 
Since we published on HRBN last week, yet another
high pro�le China “blue chip” – Sino-Forest (TRE in
Canada, SNOFF in the US) has been decimated by
allegations of fraud from Muddy Waters Research.  The
stories of Chinese frauds have gone from the back
pages of weblogs to front-page news in business
journals worldwide.


The SEC has also recently stated its intention to
increase scrutiny of US-based auditors within its inquiry
into Chinese reverse-merger companies.

One thing for sure hasn’t changed:  Harbin’s auditor still
is listed as Frazer Frost, a �rm which no longer exists. 
Frazer and Frost have dissolved their partnership;
Frazer, who remains as Harbin’s auditor, also has RINO
and CVVT to its credit, among other notorious stock
failures in the China space.


 


And another thing hasn’t changed in the past eight
months.  Harbin Electric still stands by a “phantom bid”
by its Chairman to take the company private.  Even
though there is no formal o�er, no committed
�nancing, and the company’s reported �nancial
performance has eroded materially in that time,
investors are sitting on the edge of their seats waiting
for the approval of this gesture by a “special
committee” formed by Harbin.  Citron expects the next
press release from the company to be an “acceptance”
of this buyout o�er, or at the very least, a special
meeting of this special committee.


 


Before we go into who is on this special committee, lets
�rst address the absurdity of this eight-month wait at
the hands of the “special committee”.  Why would it
take three men a total of eight months to approve an
informal o�er to take the company private at a
signi�cant premium?  Heck, the US Congress took less
time to bail out the entire banking system and the US
automakers!


 


“The Company’s Board of Directors has formed a
special committee of independent directors consisting
of David Gatton, Boyd Plowman and Ching Chuen
Chan (the "Special Committee") to consider this
proposal.  The Special Committee intends to retain
independent advisors, including an independent
financial advisor, to assist it in its work. No decisions
have been made by the Special Committee with
respect to the Company's response to the proposal.
There can be no assurance that any definitive offer will
be made, that any agreement will be executed or that
this or any other transaction will be approved or
consummated. A copy of the press release is filed
5/18/2018 “That’s My Story and I’m Stickin’ To It” – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/thats-my-story-and/ 3/6


herewith as Exhibit 99.1 to this current report on Form
8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.”


   Introducing “The Committee”


While Citron eagerly awaits the special news this
special committee will be generating soon, we’d like to
introduce the players to you now. 


   Introducing committee member #1:


The chairman of the special committee is a gentleman
named Boyd Plowman.  Mr. Plowman is the former CFO
of Fleetwood Enterprises and is the chairman of the
HRBN audit committee as well.  Interestingly enough
just two months ago, the trustee of his former
employer, now in bankruptcy, sued him.


 


“Plaintiff alleges on information and belief that
Defendant used or benefited from his senior
position with the Debtors to cause or to
influence the Debtors to use corporate assets to
make Benefit Plan payments to himself and
other insiders at a time when the Debtors were
insolvent.”

Note: Citron does not believe this makes Mr. Plowman
a bad person and we do not know the end result of the
lawsuit.  It just shows that Mr. Plowman has no
problem playing “loose with the rules”.


 


… and now, Member #2


 


The next member of the special committee is David
Gatton.  The company has no problem publishing the
many accolades of Mr. Gatton :

[https://www.wikinvest.com/stock/Harbin_Electric_%28HRBN%2


 


However, Citron notes that Mr. Gatton was also on the
board of directors of Bodisen Biotech.  Bodison was
one of the �rst and most notorious of the China
reverse merger stock frauds, after being a battleground
stock for some years.  Of course, the company blamed
its eventual demise on short sellers.

SHO.aspx
[http://geoinvesting.com/forums/yaf_postsm3635_BODISEN-
CASE-ANALYSIS--COLLUSION-BETWEEN-STOCK-
SHO.aspx]


 


Bodisen was eventually delisted in March of 2007, but
Mr. Gatton did not resign until February of 2008.


 


Again, this does not make Mr. Gatton guilty of any
crime.  It just shows that he is not immune to aligning
himself with unscrupulous companies whose strategy
for “creating value for shareholders” is essentially doing
battle with short sellers. 


   …and Member #3


The last person on the special committee is Ching
Cheun Chan. Much like Mr. Gatton, the company details
many accolades in Mr. Chan's career.

But we also see he was also a director of a broken
penny stock in Singapore called Azeus Systems.

Azeus now trades for .08 cents

Ching Cheun Chan was also on the board of a dubious
US penny stock named Rotoblock, which he just
resigned from in February 2011.  That stock currently
trades by appointment at $1. 


In 2008 it was promoted to a brief high of $10 per
share.

He also has stints on advisory boards of ZAAP and ALTI,
which trade for 50c and a $1, respectively. 


http://people.forbes.com/pro�le/chan-ching-
chuen/39300 [http://people.forbes.com/pro�le/chan-
ching-chuen/39300]


Again, this does not make Mr. Chan a bad person; it
just seems to Citron that he is a name for hire who
does not mind aligning himself with any public
company regardless of their credibility.


   Conclusion


 


So as investors mull over this phantom bid, Citron
believes it is important to note the pedigree of the
three gentlemen who we believe will be at the
epicenter of Harbin’s next PR. 


 


The fact that Harbin has delayed its response for so
many months, while expecting investors to be keep
paying to keep the stock price up, just takes us back to
the good ole country sound “That’s  My Story and I’m
Stickin’ To It”.
