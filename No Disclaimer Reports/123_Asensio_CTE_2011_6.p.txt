CTE’s Unsubstantiated Intellectual Property
Claims


Posted on August 19, 2011 by Asensio.com


We believe that SinoTech Energy Limited (NASDAQ: CTE $2.40) has


made unsubstantiated claims regarding its purported intellectual


property rights. It appears that CTE has misrepresented its


supposed “exclusive” right to use “unique” lateral hydraulic drilling


(LHD) technology. We believe that, CTE has made these


misrepresentations as a way to justify paying dramatically inflated


prices (Click here to see the report “CTE’s Potential Overpayments


for Drilling Equipment could exceed US$100 million”) to an


intermediary for LHD equipment using funds obtained from its


public offering of stock to investors.


CTE claims to have the exclusive right in China to use technology


based upon patents developed by Carl Landers (US Patent #5413184,


5853056, and 6125949). However, CTE’s claims to exclusivity on the


Landers patents appear false, based upon public documents and


information obtained from industry sources, including current and


former owners of the Landers patents. Click here to see the Patent


License Transfer notes.


CTE does not claim that it obtained exclusive license rights from the


patent owner. Instead, CTE claims that another licensee, Jet Drill


Well Services, LLC, provided CTE with exclusive rights in China.


However, it appears that Jet Drill had no legal right to grant CTE an


exclusive license.


There is an extensive public record on transfers of license rights


and ownership for the Landers patents. This record arises from the


Landers patents having been owned and licensed by two US public


companies. A company formerly called Maxim TEP, Inc., now


known as Conquest Petroleum, Inc. (Pink Sheets: CQPT), first


licensed then owned the Landers patents over the period from 2005

to 2009. Documents filed by CTE show that Jet Drill claims to have


been given the right to grant an exclusive sublicense for China


under an agreement with Maxim from 2008. Maxim’s license


agreements, which were filed with the SEC, do not include such an


agreement with Jet Drill. To see one of Maxim’s license agreements,


click here.


Jet Drill appears to have obtained a non-exclusive license to use the


Landers patents in North America from Maxim; based on an


agreement filed by Maxim with the SEC. The consideration for Jet


Drill’s non-exclusive license was the cancellation of debt that


Maxim owed to Jet Drill, which amounted to only $112,450


according to another Maxim SEC filing. Jet Drill had no right to


transfer a China “exclusive” on the Landers patents to CTE.


Well Enhancement Services, LLC (“WES”) purchased the patents in


2009 from Maxim. Jet Drill had only a non-exclusive license for


North America. To see that documentation click here.


Two other companies in China have the rights to use the same


Landers technology, according to industry sources. The private


company that currently owns the Landers patents, Radial Drilling


Services, Inc. (“RDS”), bought the patent from WES and has licensed


the Landers patents for use by another company in China,


according to a RDS representative and a press release. Click here to


see that press release. The Chinese company is Yantai Jereh Oilfield


Services Group Co., Ltd. (Shenzen: 002353), which is listed in China.


WES, the former owner of the Landers patents, has also provided


equipment using the Landers technology to another company in


China, called Shanghai Witsun Jetdrill Enhancement Services Co.,


Ltd. (“Witsun”). WES only sold the Landers patents under the


condition that WES could be allowed to continue its relationship


with Witsun, according to a WES representative.


Adding to the irregularity of CTE’s patent claims is that CTE does not


disclose having to pay any royalties for use of the patented


technology. RDS and WES have confirmed that they have not


received royalty payments from CTE and have no relationship with


CTE.
