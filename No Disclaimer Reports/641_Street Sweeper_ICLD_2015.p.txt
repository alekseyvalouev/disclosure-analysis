InterCloud Systems: Form D, Financial Storms Threaten This Non-
Cloud Company

Summary


ICLD recently filed Form D to sell $3 million in stock. With related-party loans
carrying up to 18% interest, other issues may signal the beginning of potentially
dilutive capital issues.


Excessive stock promotion allegations dog ICLD in the form of a class action lawsuit
and an SEC subpoena linked to a sweeping market manipulation probe.


Garnering little to no interest from institutional investors or analysts, ICLD tries to
justify its efforts by saying its stock would decline if not for promotions.


ICLD’s history of promotional issues is rivaled by its history of buying bad assets that
deliver losses.


ICLD has gloomed onto “the cloud”, but the filings reveal virtually no cloud-based
revenue.


InterCloud Systems (NASDAQ:ICLD) stock blew through low-hanging clouds on a recent
small contract award and today's announcement of an effort to improve clients'
experience.


But InterCloud is in such dire financial straits that top executives and directors just filed
notice for the sale of $3 million in stock.


And that is just the most recent of numerous stormy issues promising to dissipate
InterCloud's stock and leave stockholders drenched without an umbrella in sight.


Here are some bullish viewpoints for investors to consider. Meanwhile, below are the top
cloud-busters that make us hate this stock:


*Reality Check Number 1: New Form D Filing, Horrible Financials


InterCloud's CEO, President, Chief Accounting Officer, Chief Financial Officer and three
directors signed off this week on the newest stock offering of $3 million through Aegis
Capital. Disclosed under Form D, the first date of sale of the stock occurred May 14.

This may be just the beginning of such efforts for InterCloud. The company's net income
plummeted 200 percent last quarter versus a year ago. So net income dropped from $10.4
million to $-10.3 million.


Indeed, the company's income, EBITDA and other metrics fall well below competitors and
the industry as a whole, as shown here.


The company's history of incredibly bad earnings and earnings misses, sometimes over
1000 percent, is shown here and below:

*Reality Check Number 2: History Of Loan Defaults; Massive Maturing, Related-
Party Debt


The company has been trying to dig itself out of its financial mess by taking on debt.


But it has historically failed there, too. Investors may see that it has failed to meet loan
covenants and ultimately defaulted on a loan agreement, shown here.


Meanwhile, InterCloud has been forced to rely on loans from insiders. The CEO, a director
and other major shareholders have floated a total of ~$7.75 million in loans just since
December 2013. See the filing pages 112-114.


And this money was loaned to the company at rates as ridiculous as 18 percent interest.


Maturing related party debt is hitting InterCloud just about now, totaling over $20 million:

*Reality Check Number 3 - Stock Promotion Complaint


Desperate companies take desperate measures.

Alleged stock promotions by stock promotion firms DreamTeamGroup and MissionIR have
landed InterCloud and the CEO/Chairman in a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges
between Nov 5, 2013, and March 17, 2014, investors deceived by untrue statements of
material significance traded artificially inflated ICLD stock. The complaint is still pending.


Allegedly aggressive promotions apparently caught the SEC's attention, as investors can
see below.


*Reality Check Number 4 - Market Manipulation Question


The Securities and Exchange Commission issued InterCloud a subpoena in May 2014,
related to its investigation into market manipulation.


The investigation began with Galena Biopharma, which allegedly paid $50,000 to a
subsidiary of The Dream Team Group to promote its stock.


Galena stock promotional efforts by Dream Team and MissionIR - firms the class action
lawsuit says are associated with InterCloud - came to light through TheStreet.com and
Seeking Alpha.


The issue heated up when a Seeking Alpha author alleged the Dream Team tried to hire
him to write promotional articles about Galena and CytRX without disclosure, and alleged
Dream Team folks promoted the stock under multiple aliases, including a hedge fund
manager alias. Barron's nicely explains the mess here.


Page 31 of InterCloud's SEC filing suggests the company is just an innocent bystander
who's been asked for a witness statement.


But the investigation that previously specifically named Galena has now been renamed,
"In The Matter of Certain Stock Promotions." So it appears to be developing into a
sweeping probe that could ultimately engulf InterCloud.


*Reality Check Number 5: Promotion Continues Today


InterCloud seems undaunted by those problems and even tries to justify its promotions
this way:


We may never obtain research coverage by securities and industry analysts. If no
securities or industry analysts commence coverage of our company, the market price
for our common stock could decline.

Indeed, the company gets little to no interest from big institutional investors, shown here.
And just one analyst shows any interest at all.


The company's CEO followed the explanatory knee-slapper just weeks ago with this
comment suggesting some folks just never learn:


InterCloud's growing backlog and sales pipeline certainly seems to contradict our
stock's performance.


*Reality Check Number 6: History of Buying Non-Performers


Management's excessive promotional efforts are rivaled only by its history of buying bad
assets. Taken from InterCloud's SEC filings, the chart below summarizes the losses
resulting from 2014 acquisitions.


IPC RentVM VaultLogix


Acquisition Price $21.15 m $5.88 m $36.80 m


Revenue $22.85 m $0.11 m $2.52 m


Income/Loss $-6.53 m $-1.29 m $-0.86 m


(Source: SEC filings)


And underperforming acquisitions continue to weigh heavily on InterCloud's FY 2014.


A check of earlier acquisitions raised other question marks, including:


**The $15 million ADEX acquisition of 2012, for example, drove down revenue and cost
the company $3.8 million in impairment expenses in FY 2014, though one would expect
more efficiency since ADEX shares an office with ADEX Medical Staffing.


**InterCloud paid $4.5 million on Sep 18, 2012 for Telnet Solutions on Rand Road in Des
Plaines, Illinois. But Google map shows no building there.

*Reality Check Number 7: Riding "Cloud" Coattails, But No or Insignificant Cloud
Revenue


InterCloud has glommed onto "the cloud", but the filings reveal virtually no cloud-based
revenue.


The cloud got top billing in the telecommunications service providers April 8 shelf
registration statement registering $100 million-worth of stock goes on and on about its
"cloud-based service offerings."


But… InterCloud's filings disclose:


During 2012 and 2011, the Company did not recognize any revenue from cloud-
based services.


During 2013, we did not recognize any revenue from cloud-based services.


As of September 30, 2014, the amount of cloud-based revenue recognized on the
unaudited condensed consolidated statement of operations has not been significant
in relation to the company's other revenue within the cloud and managed services
segment.


Conclusion


InterCloud's filing this week is likely just the beginning of the probable dilutive capital
issues bearing down on shareholders. This cash-poor company is dogged by excessive
promotional allegations, lack of institution interest, consistently missed earnings, horrible
earnings, historically bad acquisitions, and lack of cloud revenue - all adding up to a
declining business.


The super-cell is building on InterCloud, lightning is striking and the tornado sirens are
screaming. Make a run for the storm shelter before this rain-wrapped stock falls to its pre-
promotional level of about $1.50.
