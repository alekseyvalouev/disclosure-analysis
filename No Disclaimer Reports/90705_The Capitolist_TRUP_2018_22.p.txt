TRUP


In an effort to point out the absurdity of the Trupanion valuation I am publishing a
DCF of the business in a "run off"


This serves as a valuable thought exercise to determine the value of the business
that TRUP has currently established (in terms of Cash Flow).


It is astounding how much growth is already priced into the shares at this price
(24.81 as of 8/19/19).


Importantly, I am publishing this methodology so that we can have a conversation
about its validity and my process, I look forward to your comments.

8/9/22, 8:21 AM Trupanion _ How Much Is Priced In? Nearly 6x The Current Book Of Business (NASDAQ _ TRUP) _ Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286786-trupanion-how-much-is-priced-in-nearly-6x-current-book-of-business?source=all_articles_title 2/7


Let Us Get Started:


Start at the top. Below is a Discounted Cash Flow "DCF" analysis of the current book of
business that Trupanion (NASDAQ:TRUP) has built. This type of analysis is just a tool to
think about a business and the value (or scale) of the profit produced by that business.
My intention here is to simply use it to describe what one is buying at today's price. Said
differently, what level of growth is already priced into the stock? What are you giving the
company credit for (in terms of operational productivity and growth) if you buy the stock
at today's price?


Interestingly the DCF aligns nicely with price of the comps (HERE) that I have previously
highlighted. An important assumption in this DCF is that the insurance book is healthy
and ISN'T experiencing a rate spiral, something we (and the company) have called into
question via state filings (HERE, HERE).


The goal, of course, is to buy stocks that have an asymmetric risk profile. For example if
the market was pricing in a doubling of the customer base and you thought it would be
up 5x in a short period of time, you should buy that stock. In the case of TRUP the
market is currently pricing in nearly 6x growth from today's book of business (in terms of
number of policies written). That's an incredible amount of faith to put into a model that
does not have the ability to be price competitive (report here).


Some key assumptions were made on the front end.


The Weighted Average Cost of Capital "WACC" needs to be generated so that we
can use it as a discount rate, in this case we let a Bloomberg terminal generate it for
us to make the description of the process easy to follow.


1.


The Avg Churn of the customers needs to be assumed/established so that we can
figure out how long the book of insurance will exist, in this case we assumed 15%
(which is slightly lower than the actual churn reported, HERE)


2.


We are going to use Churn to calculate the implied number of years that the run off
would last (so that we know how many periods/years to interrogate) here I calculate
6.67 years - but will round up to 7 years to give TRUP the benefit of doubt. According
to PetMD.com the avg lifespan of a dog is between 8-11 years if we assume that the
average pet owner signs up for insurance in years 1-4 of their pets life the 7 year run
off makes sense.

Next set of assumptions and calculations:


For the sake of simplicity we are going to be working with all our calculations in per/pet
numbers - so ~$35 in profit will be ~$35 in profit/pet. Later we can just multiply it by the
number of pets under policy to true up the calculations with real would numbers. A few
more assumptions must be made:


You can see the number of periods below is 7, which is consistent with rounding up
from 6.67 (according to PetMD.com the avg lifespan of a dog is between 8-11 years,
given that most don't sign up for pet insurance until the animal is 1-4 years old this 7
year run off seems appropriate)


1.


The currently reported subscription pet number of 461,314 is degraded (by the 15%
churn number given above) each period.


2.


The Implied Rev/Pet number is derived by dividing the quarterly subscription
business Rev by the number of subscription pets - yielding a $ per pet number of
$686 on an annualized basis (calculated by taking the company-disclosed
subscription revenue and divide by the average subscription pets in the quarter then
multiply by 4 to get an annualized figure.)


3.


I assume a price increase of 8.5% nationally each period4.


I assume a 6% claims cost increase every period (according to the company vet
inflation is running at 5% to 10% so I stuck with the low end of that range to be
conservative)

Now we need to expand this to include operational costs


Below I take historical ratios for SG&A, Stock Based Comp, and
Depreciation/Amortization. Remember this is still on a per/pet basis and is published in
actual dollars. To make this more tangible:


I'm suggesting that the Gross Profit (income - claims = gross profit) is about
$181/pet.


1.


That the company spends $61.69 in SG&A to support that policy (and that that
spend, as a percentage of revenue, will drop by 50 basis points every year)


2.


That the Executives pay themselves $5.69 in stock based comp to run that pet3.


D&A and CapEx are straight forward4.


Source: Author's calculations, company filings


Now we take those assumptions and turn them into cash


EBITDA is generated by taking gross profit and removing SG&A while adding back
Stock Comp and D&A.


1.


Cash Taxes (set to 20%) are calculated by removing SG&A from the Gross Profit line
and then taxing 20% of the remaining number.


2.


We have to respect CapEx now that the company owns its own real estate, I see that
being a relatively straight % of revenue.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4286786-trupanion-how-much-is-priced-in-nearly-6x-current-book-of-business?source=all_articles_title 5/7


In the end we calculate that in "Period 1" TRUP generates $96.61/pet in Free Cash
Flow "FCF" (EBITDA-TAX-CAPEX)


4.


Then we multiply that $96.61 of FCF/Pet by the 461k pets under management -
yielding $44.569 million in FCF for Period 1 off of the existing business

Unfortunately, over time the effect of the discount rate continues to whittle away at the
value of those cash flows. As you can see above (in the "Total DCF" line) when one
adds the total value of those discounted cash flows up you will get a value of about
$149m - which translates to about $4.33/share.


The company has an additional $2.65/share in cash and short term investments. I didn't
include this in the DCF for two reasons:


That capital is not available to be distributed to shareholders (by way of dividend or
share repurchase) as most of it is tied up in the form of "statutory capital" - an
amount of capital that state regulators require the company to keep on hand to
support the insurance business.

Conclusion


Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure. 


For a limited time, save 52% on your annual membership to her service Tech
Insider Network. You’ll get all the new Tech Kings plus a simple hedging strategy
to help you offset volatility.
Join the next boom » 


This exercise is about valuing the current book of business - which the DCF
accomplishes.


2.


Now that you know the number you are free to add it back in if you disagree with me.3.


First and foremost I welcome your thoughts on how you would run this analysis for
TRUP's current book of business. As I see it the company needs to have a book of
about 2.6m pets in order to have a runoff DCF that approximates the current share
price. This math is not dissimilar from what the comp sales have been telling us for
some time now ($4.33/share plus 2.65/share cash = $6.98/share of total value).


The only question one needs to ask is how many years will it be until TRUP grows its
policy holder base to 2.6m subscription lives (currently running at 15k net pet adds per
quarter this is about 43 years of growth), because you won't be able to reliably make
money off the stock until that happens. At this price the longs are already giving them
credit for the 2.6m lives under management... nobody reliably makes money until TRUP
grows well past that number (which is roughly 5.7x the current business).
