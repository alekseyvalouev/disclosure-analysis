SPI Energy Co., Ltd (Nasdaq: SPI): The Perpetual Pump 
and Dump – Electric Vehicles Will Be No Di�erent


- We believe SPI is an egregious pump and dump compa-
ny. The company’s stock has had a date with almost all the
hottest trends in the recent two years, including Cryptocurrency,
CBD, and now Electric Vehicles.
- The stock tells a repetitive story of pumping the stock on
news of hot strategic establishment, followed by aggressive PR
campaigns and ultimately a failing value proposition.
- In early 2018, SPI launched its cryptocurrency platform,
which we believe has never been operational. Today it contrib-
utes abysmal revenue.
- In September 2019, SPI launched its hemp and CBD
business amongst the cannabis hype. Once again, it was followed
by multiple PR campaigns. However, the business never came to
fruition. Recently it was reported that the whole growth facility
would likely be shut down.
- Recently in September 2020, SPI launched a company
called EdisonFuture Inc., focusing on the design and develop-
ment of electric vehicles (EV) and EV charging solutions. Through
desktop research and on the ground research, we present
overwhelming evidence that this will also fail.
- Most notably, we found out that the key Chinese EV
partner doesn’t have any current operations and all business was
halted over a year ago. Site visits and calls with distributors
con�rmed our suspicions.
- We identi�ed that the CEO of SPI is a wanted fugitive in
China. He has also been involved in another public company that
went bankrupt prior to joining SPI.
- The company has numerous convertible bonds in
default, indicating poor capital management, poor investment 
decisions and poor operations.
- The company’s current auditor is of such low credibility
that PCAOB has prohibited them from conducting China Audits.
- As if their core business wasn’t weak enough, 80% of the
company’s core solar revenue is at risk due to a lawsuit that
occurred in May 2020.
- We see a clear pattern of pump and dump, riding on
trends. With a negative book value of equity, we believe the stock
will at best return to previous levels, at worst quickly become
another one of the CEO’s bankrupt companies.

Research report on SPI Energy Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPI)


Background
SPI is a typical company without clear strategic 
initiatives. The company was established to focus on 
photovoltaic (PV) solutions for business, residential 
and government utility customers and investors. 
However, its core business has been consistently 
losing money and declining. Perhaps unsatis�ed with 
its equity performance, the company resorted to 
“pursuing” whatever is hottest in the market. The 
Solar company has been involved in not only Crypto-
currency, CBD, Agriculture, but also EV in just 2 year, 
all in the name of participating in the “Green Indus-
try”. Though they were obviously very successful at 


October 22nd 2020


promoting their stories through conferences and Press 
Releases, their business endeavors have all failed 
rapidly. 


The stock was lackluster, until it recently �ew through 
the roof on September 23rd 2020, on the news that it 
had set up an EV subsidiary “EdisonFuture Inc.” to 
engage in EV development and production. However, 
through extensive research, we conclude that the 
company is nothing more than a perpetual pump and 
dump maniac, and this EV endeavor will likely end in a 
quick pop.

EV Endeavor between “Ghost” Subsidiary EdisonFuture 
and Insolvent Chinese Manufacturer Destined to Fail
On September 23rd, SPI issued a press release stating that it had established an Electrical Vehicle Subsidiary 
EdisonFuture, Inc., to design and develop electric vehicles and EV charging solutions. 


Shortly after on October 15, 2020, SPI announced that:


“its wholly-owned subsidiary, EdisonFuture Inc. ("EdisonFuture"), has entered into a strategic cooperation 
framework agreement with Shaanxi Tongjia Automobile Co., Ltd. ("Tongjia"), a leading manufacturer of 
all-electric logistic vehicles in China.
Under the terms of the agreement, EdisonFuture and Tongjia will cooperate in the customized design, 
development, production, and sales of a new generation of smart electric pickup trucks and electric 
logistics vehicles. Tongjia will supply parts and support to EdisonFuture's assembly facility in Fresno, 
California, where EdisonFuture will complete assembly of the vehicles, including the addition of software 
and other parts produced locally. EdisonFuture will also be the exclusive North American distributor of 
all-electric "last-mile" delivery box trucks and pickup trucks currently produced by Tongjia.”


The stock market welcomed the two pieces of news with the stock rising as high as 4,300% and 27.3% respec-
tively. However, upon a closer look, we quickly identi�ed major risks beneath the exciting EV venture. 


Shaanxi Tongjia Automobile Co., Ltd. Halted Operation Since Sept 2019


Shaanxi Tongjia Automobile Co., Ltd., (“Shaanxi Tongjia”) which we were able to identify as 陕西通家汽车股份有
限公司 is a largely problematic company that has halted operation since September 2019.

New Sea Union Technology Group Co., Ltd (“New Sea

with a stock ticker of SZ002089. It mainly engages 
business in communication products, internet data 


center related products, and lithium battery 
materials. The company is a 35.82% equity interest 
shareholder of Shaanxi Tongjia. 


Source: New Sea Union 2020 First  Half Report


Due to New Sea Union being a signi�cant shareholder 
of Shaanxi Tongjia, it updates Shaanxi Tongjia’s 
operation status from time to time. The information 
disclosed by New Sea Union suggests that Shaanxi 
Tongjia is in serious trouble. Moreover, Shaanxi 
Tongjia’s operations/productions have been halted 
since September 2019. 


In a press release issued in October 2019, New Sea 
Union was informed that Shaanxi Tongjia’s produc-
tions have been halted since September 2019. The 
company discloses that the reason behind halting 
of operation is due to the decline in the auto 
industry in China and a deteriorating cash �ow 
situation. This was prior to any impact from Covid.


“但自 9 月份开始，由于汽车行业宏观环境的变化，通家公司现金流愈发紧张，局势持续恶化
。截至目前，上述几项措施也未取得实质性进展。为此， 通家公司管理层经过审慎考虑，一致
决定：通家公司只保留部分高管和骨干 人员正常上班，留守关键岗位，保障销售、售后等非生
产性经营，其他人员 进入待岗状态，公司进入停产阶段。”


Translation
“Since September [2019], because of the auto industry macro environment’s change, [Shaanxi] Tongjia’s 
cash �ow gets tighter and the situation continues to worsen. Until now, the abovementioned several 
activities didn’t generate material positive development. Thus, after careful consideration, [Shaanxi] 
Tongjia’s management decide: [Shaanxi] Tongjia will only maintain part of senior management and 
backbone employees to remain in the key positions, and will keep non-production activities such as sales 
and after-sales services. All the other employees will become employment waiting status, and the compa-
ny will enter into the production-halt stage.“

In the updated New Sea Union 2020 annual report 
issued on June 30, 2020, when discussing the produc-
tion-halt of Shaanxi Tongjia, the company stated that 
as of this annual report issuance date, Shaanxi Tongjia 
still hasn’t resumed production yet.


Hence as of June this year, Shaanxi Tongjia still hasn’t 


resumed production. In fact, we believe it is highly 
unlikely that Shannxi Tongjia will resume production 
any time soon. The disclosed �nancial data of Shaanxi 
Tongjia by New Sea Union in its �rst half 2020 report 
suggests that Shaanxi Tongjia is essentially insolvent 
with minimal revenues. (During 1H 2020, we estimate 
a sale of no more than 20 cars)

October 22nd 2020


R E P O R T S


EV Endeavor between “Ghost” Subsidiary EdisonFuture 
and Insolvent Chinese Manufacturer Destined to Fail


Source: New Sea Union 2020 First  Half Report


We observe that the shareholder equity of Shaanxi 
Tongjia is negative 1.25 billion RMB (~-178 million 
USD). The revenues for the �rst half of 2020 is 926 
thousand RMB (~132 thousand USD) with a net loss of 
26.9 million RMB (~-3.8 million USD), as compared to 
revenues for the �rst half of 2019 of 90.8 million RMB 
(~13.0 million USD) with a net loss of 98.4 million RMB 
(~-14.1 million USD). Moreover, it appears that 
Shaanxi Tongjia still owes about 675 million RMB to 
New Sea Union as of March 11, 2020. 


These levels of indebtedness and a prolonged period 
of halted operations lead us to believe that the 


company is likely in bankruptcy without any prospect 
of resuming production; Especially since producing 
more will simply lead to more losses. It will likely need 
to clear all �nancial and operational issues, or even 
undergo a serious restructuring before it can start 
production. 


New Sea Union also recently responded on October 
18th 2020 that in light of the recent SPI agreement, 
SPI is sending professional personnel to Shaanxi 
Tongjia to conduct due diligence and discuss the 
future models. This should assist Shaanxi Tongjia to 
resume operations soon.

Furthermore, we recently sent our investigator to visit Shaanxi Tongjia and observe �rst hand whether the

was still in operation halt and hasn’t resumed production or any other activities. 


On The Ground Due Diligence Con�rms Operation Is Still Halted


With all the information we discovered regarding 
the counterparty, Shaanxi Tongjia, we have no 
choice but to believe that this strategic coopera-
tion agreement between SPI and Shaanxi Tongjia 
is nothing more than an attempt to jump on the 
EV frenzy and to pump its stock price. We see 
nothing of any economic substance that could 
come out of this arrangement.

EV Endeavor between “Ghost” Subsidiary EdisonFuture 
and Insolvent Chinese Manufacture Destined to Fail


EdisonFuture Inc. Appears to be Non-Existent


What’s perhaps equally disturbing is the background 
of EdisonFuture Inc. Unlike the near-bankrupt coun-
terparty who has a background of failed operations, 
EdisonFuture has no background at all. In fact, we 
were unable to identify EdisonFuture anywhere. 


Typically US companies will �le a corporate registra-
tion with local divisions of corporations. This will then 
be captured by websites like opencorporates.com. 
However, we were unable to identify EdisonFuture in 
any government database. 


This could potentially be due to the company being 
registered recently and hence it has not been logged 
into the system. But we con�rmed with Fresno 
County Clerks and validated that no pending compa-
nies were called EdisonFuture.


Furthermore, the company stated in its press release 
that:


We reached out to the company shortly after their 
press release, requesting further information on 
EdisonFuture, its address, and its Fresno County 
facility’s whereabouts. However, the company has yet 
to respond. 


Our investigator also visited SPI’s headquarter in 
Santa Clara in attempt to get a response in person, 
but was greeted with an empty o�ce with no sign of 
activity. 


“Tongjia will supply parts and support toEdisonFuture’s assembly facility in Fresno, California, where 
EdisonFuture will complete assembly of the vehicles, including the addition of software and other parts 
produced locally.”

EV Endeavor between “Ghost” Subsidiary EdisonFuture 
and Insolvent Chinese Manufacture Destined to Fail


EdisonFuture Inc. Appears to be Non-Existent Cont.


We identi�ed that SPI previously established a company called CBD & HEMP Group Co., Ltd. 


According to California state �lings, CBD & Hemp holds principal o�ce at 700 Center Street, Orange Cove, Fresno 
County, California. 


CBD & Hemp was established in 2019 in an attempt to capitalize on the CBD wave. However, as we will show in 
later parts of the report, that endeavor ended in a quick failure. We believe EdisonFuture is likely referring to this 
property as their production facility. Even if we assume they were really to produce cars here, transforming a CBD 
extraction facility into an EV production facility will likely be a laborious and costly process. We believe if Edison-
Future was to operate here, it would likely meet its predecessor’s fate, a quick and utter disaster.

A Routine of Frenzy Riding, Stock Manipulation and Pump 
and Dump


Considering the quality of the EV cooperation agreement, we were not surprised to �nd that SPI has had a historic 
tendency to tag along whatever was hottest in the market and manipulate its stock accordingly. 


We see a clear pattern the company follows:


Step 1: Pump - Establishing a subsidiary to launch X business in X sector, stock reaches highs.
Step 2: Dump - Paint a holy grail for investors via press releases and conferences while share price plummets.
Step 3: Slump - Share price enters prolonged state of decline to/below original levels when investors realize 
they are a scam.

Cryptocurrency Frenzy Cont.


Today, cryptocurrency provides less than 5% of the company’s revenue as of 2019. Ironically, this has been an 
increase compared to 2018’s 0.8%. This is a surprise, especially since the website www.umining.io along with its 
social media are not even operational. We question whether auditors have carefully examined this at all.

A Routine of Frenzy Riding, Stock Manipulation and Pump 
and Dump


Cannabis Frenzy Cont.
(Step 2) Dump - Company issues multiple updates 
on its CBD business and partakes in numerous 
conferences and interviews. However, stock price 
continues to steadily decline. 


The company later entered into a business agree-
ment with Native American Agricultural Company 
(NAAC) to cultivate hemp in the Navajo Nation, and 
obtained licenses from Navajo Nation to engage in 
lab testing, cultivation, wholesale distribution and 
retail sales of hemp. A company called CBD & HEMP 


Group Co., Ltd. was established shortly after. In Jan 
2020, the company completed the installation of its 
cannabidiol extraction and milling equipment at a 
facility in Orange Cove, Fresno County, California.


The company also partook in interviews. We encour-
age investors to watch this particular one as it 
showcases the passion and false hope the company 
is portraying. One should clearly see how misleading 
it is now that we know the outcome.


(Step 3) Slump - Once again, symptoms quickly 
arose indicating that the business venture was 
poorly considered and was more of a PR stunt. 


On Jan 29th 2020, SPI provided an update indicating 
that NAAC failed to deliver hemp crops. A report 
indicated that SPI invested $1.1m into the Shiprock 
farms. However, investments quickly dried up when 
the investee couldn’t deliver any of the hemp plants 
due to de�ciency and poor quality in November 
2019. 


More recently, Navajo Nation is moving to shut down 
hemp farms amidst claims of illegal marijuana 
growing. The Shiprock farm that SPI invested in was 
also accused of human tra�cking, unlawfully 
issuing permits, and operating without permits. 


SPI hasn’t reported any revenue from the cannabis 
sector since 2018. Once again, investors are misled 
by management’s wild claims and are left under the 
water. 


Once again, we suggest current and potential 
interested parties in SPI to look at their RedChip 
interview and compare their claims with results.

Bad Blood: Chairman is a Wanted Fugitive Who Ran a 
failed US Listed Company (LDK Solar) 


The CEO and Chairman of SPI, Xiaofeng Peng, previ-
ously led another China-based US-listed company 
LDK Solar (ticker: LDK) into bankruptcy. As the chair-
man, he drove the company into the ground with 
overproduction.  


SPI is his second US-listed public company. Initially, 
SPI was in the P2P lending business in the form of 
solar products and service vendors. The business 
model was �awed from the beginning, where individ-
ual investors would invest money into SPI, SPI would 
act as an intermediary who would use the funds to 
purchase solar panels and lease them to solar power 
farms, �nally, solar power farms would repay SPI with 
electricity revenue and government incentives, who 
would then deliver it to individual investors. 


That whole business quickly went into a total bust 
again. Investors soon discovered that they were 
unable to withdraw funds from the platform. Accord-
ing to this Xinhuanet article published in August 
2018, the company was charged with illegally 
absorption of public deposits. 


证券时报记者自苏州工业园区人民检察院官网获悉，7月25日，因涉嫌非法吸收公众存款罪，江
苏绿能宝融资租赁有限公司、夏侯敏、刘菁、何琳被苏州工业园区人民法院提起公诉。
随后不久，一份苏州市公安局的来信答复意见书文件显示，“彭某某（彭小峰）经园区检察院
批准逮捕，我局已向公安部申请发布国际刑警组织红色通缉令。”


Translation:
The reporter from Securities Times received information from Suzhou Industrial Park’s people's prosecuto-
rial o�ce that, on July 25 [2018], the company Jiangsu Solarbao Leasing Co., Ltd., [individuals including] 
Houmin Xia, Jing Liu, and Lin He are all prosecuted by the People’s Court of Suzhou Industrial Park. 
Not long afterward, a replied document from Suzhou Police Department shows that “XX Peng (Xiaofeng 
Peng) was approved by the prosecutorial o�ce to be arrested and our department has applied to the 
Ministry of Public Securities to issue Red Notice from International Criminal Police Organization (INTER-
POL).”


We do not believe Xiaofeng Peng is currently on the Red Notice list of Interpol, however, there is no doubt that 
Mr. Peng is a wanted fugitive from China. 


With Xiaofeng Peng and SPI’s history, it is hard to believe any legitimate companies from China would be willing 
to conduct business with them.

Core Business Hanging on a Thread: 80% of Rev at Risk
In the company’s most recent 20-F, the company quietly slipped in a huge timebomb in their business overview 
section.


In May 2020, Solar Juice Co. Ltd (“Solar Juice Co”),a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, in its 
capacity as shareholder of Solar Juice Australia (an Australian company) together with Mr. Kun Fong Lee 
and Mr. Jinhan Zhou (who hold shares in Solar Juice Australia as trustee for Solar Juice Co) ("SPI Share-
holders") commenced proceedings in the Federal Court of Australia as plainti�s against its other share-
holders and some of its other directors and purported directors and against Solar Juice Australia ("Defen-
dants") in relation to a purported new rights issue undertaken by Solar Juice Australia, the purported 
removal by those other shareholders of Mr. Lee and Mr. Zhou as directors of Solar Juice Australia and the 
purported appointment of an additional director. The SPI Shareholders allege that the purported new 
rights issue and the subsequent purported removal and appointment of directors are invalid and ine�ec-
tive and therefore should be set aside. If e�ective, the purported rights issue will result in the SPI Share-
holders' shareholding in Solar Juice Australia being reduced from 80% to 40%. If our lawsuit is not 
successful, we will not control Solar Juice Australia or be able to consolidate its �nancial results in 
our �nancial statements and our �nancial results and stock price will be materially adversely 
a�ected. Solar Juice currently accounts for 82.3% of our revenues and 15.7% of our total assets.


SPI, who almost posts a press release regarding anything, chose not to mention this via PR statement. Though we 
were not able to access Australian lawsuits to assess the possibility of SPI losing, we see this threat to be existen-
tial and urge the company to provide more transparency to investors. 


SPI could potentially lose Solar Juice, which currently accounts for 
82.3% of SPI’s revenues and 15.7% of total assets.

Research report on SPI Energy Co., Ltd. (Nasdaq: SPI)


October 22nd 2020


R E P O R T S


As demonstrated by the numerous investment endeavors into cryptocurrency and cannabis, we see time and 
time again that the company has failed to deliver anything meaningful. In addition, we discovered overwhelming 
evidence indicating that the most recent EV endeavor will almost de�nitely end up exactly the same way as SPI’s 
previous investments. 


We believe SPI management is fundamentally �awed and untrustworthy. At best, they are ill-equipped to make 
sound investment decisions and keep pouring money into failed investments. We �nd it especially telling how 
the �rm entered the cryptocurrency business at the height of crypto asset prices and seemingly terminated the 
business right before crypto prices started to rebound. At worst, they are an egregious group of stock manipula-
tors that misleads SPI investors into making terrible investments. 


We present numerous other red �ags, every single one of which alone should caution investors to steer clear of 
SPI. We �nd it worrisome that regulators, and the NASDAQ, have not yet taken notice of SPI’s practices. We believe 
the company and its management is predatory and call for an immediate delisting. In conclusion, we believe SPI 
is utterly uninvestable.
