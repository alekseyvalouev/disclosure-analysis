Summary:	Stock	is	55%-65%	Overvalued	
• euglena	is	a	Co.	that	dreams	big.	It	seems	to	have	made	investors	believe	in	its	dreams	and	overlook	realities,	
which	has	inflated	shares	to	fairy	tale	levels.	We	examined	the	co.’s	strategy	and	found	it	utterly	unconvincing.


• Co.	says	its	major	value	lies	in	being	a	future	supplier	of	biofuel,	especially	for	airplanes.	The	reality	is	that	the	
cost	of	producing	algae-based	biofuel	remain	at	$300	to	$1,000	per	barrel	of	crude	oil	equivalent.	Costs	won’t	
drop	to	competitive	levels	at	test	facilities	until	at	least	2022,	according	to	the	U.S.	Department	of	Energy.


• Co.	states	its	plans	to	launch	commercial	biofuel	sales	by	2020.	At	the	same	time,	it	reports	that	its	preliminary	
test	facility	is	already	behind	schedule	and	won’t	start	operating	until	2019.	


• Co.’s	test	facility	(once	complete)	will	produce	only	enough	biofuel	for	1	airplane	to	fly	Tokyo-Osaka	and	back.
• Co.	has	no	patents	protecting	its	technological	“advantage.”	Bigger,	better-capitalized	Japanese	companies	are	
starting	to	enter	the	market.


• U.S.	rivals	have	beaten	Co.	to	commercializing	algae-based	biofuel.	Despite	this,	the	stock	of	listed	U.S.	rivals	has	
dropped	~90%	on	oil	price	decline.	We	expect	Co.’s	shares	to	follow.


• Major	U.S.	biofuel	players	are	changing	strategy	to	health	supplements.	We	question	Co.’s	commitment	to	
biofuel	development	given	the	zero	hope	of	profit	in	next	5	years	(based	on	Co.’s	own	over-optimistic	strategy).


• The	reality	of	Co.’s	business	is	that	it	earns	99.9%	from	health	foods,	a	niche	that	is	close	to	saturation.

What	Is	a	Euglena?


Euglena	has	the	properties	of	
both	a	plant	and	an	animal	and	
lives	in	fresh	and	salt	water.	It	
uses	photosynthesis	to	make	
oxygen.	
Oil	stored	in	the	euglena	body	
produces	a	fuel	that	is	similar	to	
diesel.	For	this	reason,	euglena-
based	fuel	has	been	mixed	with	
kerosene	to	produce	bio-fuel	for	
jets.	Euglena	is	also	used	for	other	
algae	(seaweed)	based	products.

euglena:	Dreaming	of	Biofuel,	Living	off	Snacks
Dreams
euglena	is	a	young	
company	that	presents	
itself	as	an	eco-friendly	
solution	for	energy	needs	
in	the	21st century.	Its	
business	is	based	on	
cultivating	euglena,	a	
single-cell	organism	that	
the	co.	says	can	be	
applied	to	many	fields	in	
the	future…


Reality
As	of	today	and	the	
next	few	years,	the	
only	real	businesses	
the	co.	has	organized	
for	its	products	are:


1)	health	food	
2)	feedstock	for	biofuel


4
Dreams
euglena	says	that	the	core	value	
of	the	company	is	in	biofuels	as	
airlines	look	for	eco-friendly	and	
sustainable	alternatives	to	crude	
oil-based	fuel.	


Reality
For	the	next	4-5	years,	the	only	
significant	profit	the	co.	can	earn	
is	from	selling	health	snacks.	This	
segment	represents	99.9%	of	co.	
revenue.

1.	Examining	Reality:	Growth	Market?
o Japan’s	market	for	health	foods	and	
supplements	is	not	a	new	market	
about	to	take	off.	It’s	already large	and	
mature,	growing	just	2%	a	year.


o That’s	because	the	number	of	health	
food	and	supplement	consumers	in	
Japan	is	about	57	million	people	– half	
the	population!


o According	to	euglena	figures,	the	size	
of	the	market	niche	in	which	its	
products	compete	is	just	¥90B	to	
¥100B.	That	means	its	sales	account	
for	10%	of	the	niche,	making	fast	
growth	from	here	on	unlikely.


6
euglena’s	Initial	Growth	Factors:	Novelty
euglena	products	had	initial	
success	because:	
1.	novelty	of	algae	goods	
2.	feel-good	PR	message.


However,	the	products	are	no	
longer	a	novelty:
1.	Other	firms	make	algae-
based	foods.
2.	Consumer	trend	change	
quickly.	
3.	There	are	more	“exotic”	
health	foods	on	the	market.


7
But,	Novelty	Factor	is	Gone…


Notice	the	huge	
media	interest	that	
euglena	highlights	on	
the	chikarakun.com
promotional	
website…


It	ended	about	2-3	
years	ago.


8
Bigger	Companies	Entering	Health	Foods	Niche
New	rules	passed	by	Japan	in	last	two	years	make	it	easier	for	
companies	to	claim	that	their	products	have	health	benefits.	
As	of	Oct.	2015,	120	applications	for	new	so-called	“functional”	
foods	were	filed	with	the	Consumer	Affairs	Agency	of	which	43	
came	from	companies	that	had	never	made	food	before.


9


Among	the	applicants	were	Nippon	
Paper	Industries	Co.	(tea	that	helps	
control	cholesterol)	and	textile	maker	
Omikenshi Co.	(fiber-rich	flour	that	
has	no	gluten	or	fat).
Direct	Competitor	in	Euglena	Cultivation:	Kobelco


10
Health	Segment	Outlook:	Defense,	Not	Offense
• euglena’s	revenue	growth	in	FY16	was	87%.	The	Co.’s	own	revenue	target	for	FY17	


implies	growth	of	35%.	We	see	this	as	the	start	of	a	significant	slowdown	in	Co.	sales	–
which	are	99.9%	reliant	on	the	health	segment.


• Co.’s	most	recent	stock	options	plan	shows	that	management	see	profit	growth	stalling.	
Strike	terms	for	6th series	plan	double	2020	revenue	target	to	¥30B	from	¥15B	in	5th
series,	but	retain	ordinary	profit	target	at	¥1B.


• Co.	is	already	a	major	player	in	algae-based	supplements	and	health	snacks	in	Japan.	Its	
own	figures	show	size	of	product	niche	is	¥90B	to	¥100B,	which	means	Co.’s	sales	
account	for	10%	of	market.	We	don’t	see	Co.	maintaining	same	fast-growth	from	here	
on	out	on	saturation.


• Co.	has	lost	the	novelty	factor	for	its	products.


• New	rivals	are	entering	health	foods	niche	due	to	easier	entry	rules.


• Co.	has	not	filed	patents	for	algae	cultivation,	hence	no	protection.


• Kobe	Steel	unit	has	set	itself	up	as	a	direct	rival	in	euglena-based	products.	More	
competition	will	lead	to	lower	profit	margins	for	the	Co.	as	its	seeks	to	defend	market	
share.	


11
2.	Examining	Dreams:	Not	Cost	Competitive
The	premise	of	using	
alternative	oils,	including	
those	sourced	from	algae,	
to	make	biofuel	is	based	on	
them	being	a	replacement	
for	gasoline-based	oil.


The	problem	is	that	the	
manufacturing	cost	of	
algae-based	oil	is	around	
$300	to	$1,000	per	barrel	
of	crude	oil	equivalent.*


Meanwhile	the	absolute	
peak	for	crude	was	$147	
per	barrel.	In	more	recent	
months,	crude	has	traded	
at	$40	-$60	per	barrel.

WTI	Crude	Price	Graph


*	Sources:	Japan	Petroleum	Energy	Center,	Bloomberg	New	Energy	
Finance,	Sapphire	Energy,	others.
2020	Oil	Price	Outlook:	$60-$80	Per	Barrel
The	Co.	has	said	its	target	is	to	start	
manufacture	of	biofuel	in	2020.


However,	the	outlook	for	crude	oil	prices	
through	2020	from	sources	such	as	the	
International	Energy	Agency,	U.S.	Energy	
Information	Administration,	the	World	Bank	
and	more	than	30	investment	banks,	think	
tanks	and	institutes	points	to	their	price	
ranging	in	the	$60	to	$80	per	bbl zone.	


13


Thus,	the	idea	that	algae-based	fuel,	which	has	production	costs	of	
$300	to	$1,000	per	bbl,	can	compete	with	crude	in	the	next	5-8	years	
is	hard	to	imagine.
When	Will	Algae	Biofuels	Begin	to	Compete?
• The	U.S.	Department	of	Energy	in	a	March	2015	policy	
paper	set	the	goal	for	algae-based	fuel	to	be	produced	at	
$3	per	gallon	of	gasoline	equivalent.	At	that	level,	the	
DoE	believes	algae-based	fuel	can	compete	with	gasoline	
derived	oil	costing	$75	to	$90	per	barrel.	


• When	will	this	happen?	The	DoE	report	lists	a	2022	
deadline	for	validating	demonstration technology	that	
can	operate	at	the	desired	$3	per	gallon	level.	


• Exxon	Mobile	is	more	pessimistic.	The	oil	major	scrapped	
a	$600	million	investment	program	into	algae	just	three	
or	so	years	ago,	saying	this	kind	of	product	is	25	years	
away from	mainstream	success.


• Plus,	when	algae-based	fuel	is	finally	competitive,	it	will	
still	need	to	compete	on	price	with	other	alternative	
energy	sources	such	as	shale	oil,	which	is	already	cost-
competitive	with	conventional	crude.


14
Co.’s	Biofuel	Plant	is	Running	Behind	Schedule
In	a	Dec.	1,	2015	press	release,	the	Co.	
announced	it	will	commercialize	algae-
based	jet	fuel	by	2020.	


The	plan	was	based	on	the	construction	
of	a	demonstration	facility	due	to	come	
online	by	early	2018.	
Less	than	a	year	later,	on	Aug.	12,	2016,	
the	Co.	announces	that	the	plan	was	
behind	schedule:	the	demonstration	
plant	would	not	be	operational	until	1H	
2019.


This	effectively	makes	any	hope	of	
achieving	commercial-scale	production	
by	2020	completely	laughable.


15


Demonstration	Plant:	


Its	entire	output,	based	on	a	standard	
90%	kerosene	/	10%	algae-based	
biofuel	mix,	would	be	enough	for	a	
single	airplane	to	make	one	return	
flight	a	week	between	Tokyo	and	
Osaka,	according	to	the	estimates	
from	ANA	Holdings,	a	potential	buyer	
of	euglena’s	product.
Will	Biofuel	Bring	in	Better	Profit	Margins?
o On	its	website,	the	Co.	says	that	biofuel	has	the	


lowest	unit	cost	based	on	production	volumes.	See	


the	costs	performance	pyramid	from	Co.’s	website	


to	the	left.	Healthcare	(“Food”	in	the	pyramid)	has	


the	highest.	


o If	“Fuel”	has	lower	costs,	why	would	that	translate	


into	better	profit	margins	than	healthcare?	Airlines	


are	unlikely	to	pay	euglena	higher	margins	for	bulk	


volume	than	consumers	buying	a	few	health	snacks.	


So,	if	biofuels	do	not	offer	better	margins,	surely	the	


development	of	that	business	spells	a	drop	in	Co.	


overall	profitability.


16
Domestic	Rivals	in	Biofuel	Have	More	Resources
The	Co.	is	not	alone	in	seeking	to	
commercialize	the	manufacture	of	
algae-based	biofuel.	Japanese	rivals	
include	IHI	Corp.,	J-Power,	Toyota	
Motors-affiliate	Denso	Corp.,	and	
DIC	Corp.	


Those	four	rivals	aim	to	reach	the	
goal	of	commercial	sales	at	the	same	
time	as	the	Co.	and	they	have	
greater	resources.

U.S.	Rivals	Already	at	Commercialization	Stage
Companies	in	the	
U.S.,	where	algae-
based	biofuel	
research	has	been	
ongoing	for	30+	
years,	have	already	
achieved	
commercialization.	
To	the	right	are	just	a	
few	of	the	examples.


Despite	this,	
Sapphire	Energy	
reported	in	Feb.	
2015	that	its	cost	of	
production	was	still	
$26	per	gallon,	which	
is	$1,000	per	crude	
oil	barrel	equivalent.

Given	the	un-competitive	costs	and	outlook	
for	algae-based	biofuels,	the	biggest	U.S.	
companies	in	the	field	(TerraVia and	Sapphire	
Energy)	are	changing	strategy	to	focus	more	
on	value-add	health	foods	and	supplements.	


This	is	exactly	the	reverse	of	Co.’s	strategy!

that	its	biofuels	business	has	a	viable	future	
in	the	next	5-8	years.

Valuation
• Given	how	far	out	potential profit	from	Co.’s	biofuel	business	
lies,	we	believe	euglena	should	be	valued	solely	on	the	basis	of	
its	Healthcare	division	(which	generates	99.9%	of	revenue).


• As	of	Jan.	17,	euglena	traded	at	a	price	to	earnings	ratio	of	150.	
This	is	far	beyond	the	ratios	companies	with	a	similar	business	
profile	enjoy.	We	believe	30x	PE	would	be	more	than	generous.

• Under	the	most	bullish	scenario	we	can	imagine,	euglena	
maintains	its	top	margins	– 15%,	from	2Q16	– and	achieves	
annual	revenue	target	of	¥15B	in	FY2017.	If	that’s	the	case	we	
estimate	it	will	post	annual	OP	of	¥2.25B	and	annual	NP	of	
¥1.6B	(¥19.36	per	share*).	


METHOD	1:
We	take	the	most	bullish	NP	
estimate	of	¥1.6B	and	apply	the	
generous	30x	PE.	That	gives	us	
MCAP	of	¥48B	(¥580	per	share).


METHOD	2:	
We	take	the	2020	revenue	target	
(¥30B)	from	Co.’s	latest	mid-term	
strategy	and	assume	it	has	same	
ratio	to	NP	as	in	previous	strategy	
(4.6%).	Using	the	2020	revenue	
target	number:	
Rev	¥30B×4.6%	margin×30x	PE	
ratio	=	MCAP	of	¥41.4B	(¥500	per	
share).


*	Note:	this	NP	estimate	is	actually	more	than	double	what	the	Co.	forecasts	for	FY17

Summary
• euglena	has	only	one	business	(Healthcare)	that	generates	revenue	/	profit	and	


this	will	not	significantly	change	in	the	next	4-5	years
• euglena’s	fast-growth in	that	one	business	is	starting	to	slow	and	we	expect	profit	


margins	to	begin	to	contract	with	increasing	competition
• euglena’s	spending	on	biofuel development	is	burning	cash	and unlikely	to	provide	


any	returns	for	investors	in	the	next	5-8	years
• euglena	technology	has	no	patent	protection	and	its	biofuel	division	is	competing	


with	rivals that	enjoy	much	larger	resources
• The	stock	is	massively	over-valued	at	150x	PE if	we	value	against	other	healthcare	


firms.	If	we	compare	Vs	listed	biofuel	rivals	(TerraVia)	then	stock	should	follow	oil	
price	drop.	Overall,	we	see	Fair	Price	target	55%-60%	below	current	share	price.


• We	believe	the	market	in	near	future	will	revisit	assumptions	on	co.’s	business	
and	future	potential,	putting	considerable	downward	pressure	on	the	stock.
