Seven Reasons Why Deloitte CANNOT Sign GSX Annual 
Audit


Note on GSX Techedu Inc. (NYSE: GSX)


In February 2020 we published our first critical report about GSX. Today, over year has passed, and many inves-
tors have come to see GSX for what it is. Many excellent reports were published over the last year by multiple 
reputable sources, making GSX the probably most exposed fraud in recent history. Unfortunately, regulators and 
auditors seem still reluctant to do the right thing. We strongly believe that it is within the auditors and regulators 
responsibility to ultimately remove GSX from a US stock exchange; In this report we focus on the issues that are 
within the scope and responsibility of the auditor to investigate. We also strongly believe that failure to investi-
gate these issues will have serious consequences for GSX’s auditor Deloitte. 


We also shares our thoughts on the recent trading environment, and GSX’s role at the center of systematic issues 
in today’s capital markets. 


GSX is facing an important deadline. On April 30th 2021 GSX’s auditor Deloitte is supposed 
to give an opinion on the 2020 annual report and financial statements that GSX issued. We 
believe that even issuing a qualified opinion would be a grave mistake on Deloitte’s part. 
The issues at GSX at too glaringly obvious.

Recall that GSX previously was able to grow their topline at 300%+ yoy while maintaining profitability. GSX 
reported that their average marketing expense per student was merely 450RMB, less than half the industry 
average. It is truly ironic that CEO Larry Chen stated in an interview in June 2020 that Short-Sellers saved them 
over 500 million (RMB?) in marketing expenses. However, operating expenses suddenly increased close to 
500% in consequent quarters.  This occured after GSX had to delay its Q2 earnings and gave a rosy outlook 
for Q3 without any mention of exploding costs.


Where is the cost saving that we “short-sellers” provided? This kind of cost structure development is completely 
unrealistic as explored in multiple in depth research report published by short sellers. We believe this is evidence 
that GSX is pressured and can no longer cook their books as aggressively as they used to. Short sellers forced 
GSX’s hand and the increased scrutiny caused auditors to have a closer look at cash and related accounts. Conse-
quently GSX had to come up explanations for the missing cash, which led to the invention of fictitious expenses. 
While the scheme is fairly obvious from the outside, auditors are in a position to actually verify expenses, billing, 
counterparts, bank wires and money flow. We strongly believe that Deloitte will find serious issues with verifying 
expenses. Specifically we doubt that bank wires underlying the transactions exist. It is up to Deloitte to verify this.

There have been multiple reports deep diving into the number of teachers without teacher certificates, or with 
fake certificates. As we have originally pointed out in our initial report, the vast number of tutors and teachers is 
simply unrealistic. According to Lujiu Caijing, Gaotu over reported qualifying teachers by 80%. These teachers 
appeared originally in their 2019 annual report, and magically disappeared once the Bureau of Education 
required GSX to publicly list them. 


Moreover, of the few teachers that did have teaching qualifications, research indicates that many were fraudu-
lent. Teacher certificate ID numbers are set up in a specific way, where certain digits represent genders and 
certain digits represent the grade they can teach. Researchers have identified that at least 15 teachers are teach-
ing in grades they are not supposed to, or worse, magically changed genders. We encourage our readers to 
review the in depth reports on the teacher certification number fraud here. 


Teachers and their verification numbers should be easy for auditors and related regulatory parties to check. All 
teachers and their Teacher Certificate are documented on the following website, http://www.gxis.net/zhengshu/. 
It requires a person’s National ID number and a Teacher Certification Number. Auditors only need to double check 
that all their Teacher Certificate Numbers in fact belong to the correct corresponding teacher, and that an 
employment contract exists with such teacher. We strongly doubt that GSX can produce these documents as they 
are harder to fake than other accounts.

As we’ve initially pointed out in our report, the returns on GSX’s long-term financial assets are surprisingly low 
given how much cash they supposedly have. This prompted us to believe that they might have fake cash balanc-
es. Investors have dug in deeper and found even more lies and inconsistencies in this respect. The verification of 
cash balances and investment liquid investment accounts should be fairly straight-forward. It requires verifica-
tion of the bank balances and investment account balances. It would be a debacle to find out later that the cash 
balances did not exist, and all it would have taken was a call by the auditor to the bank to confirm the bank 
balance. This exact scenario has recently played out at Wirecard, and Ernst Young finds itself rightfully at the 
center of the outrage about audit failures. We see a similar debacle on the horizon for Deloitte if they were to sign 
off on GSX’s cash balances.


Reason 3: Long Term Investments


The recent private placement of $870m announced in December 2020 remains mysterious. GSX did not give any 
information about the identity of the purchaser, which is exceedingly strange for a placement of this size. We 
believe this lack of disclosure indicates potential related party transactions, circular funds and other problematic 
issues with the financing. We simply find it extremely difficult to understand why investors, who dare to back GSX 
while the company is under scrutiny, is reluctant to disclose their name and position. This is again a very easy 
issue to figure out for an auditor with access to internal documents. Deloitte does have the definitive answers to 
the following questions and its in their responsibility to inform investors about the truth: Did this placement 
really occur and who are the buyers? GSX also did not use a broker, which is unheard of for a transaction this size. 
CEO Larry Chen said they didn't need a broker because they had investors familiar with their business.


Reason 4: Mysterious Private Placement


In our initial report we outlined what we believe to be blatant CAPEX fraud. In January 2020 GSX purchased real 
estate for over RMB300m, but our research indicates that the purchase price was in reality on a fraction of what 
was reported to US investors. Even before the public scrutiny, GSX faced the problem of missing cash balances 
that came with fake profits. We believe the CAPEX fraud that occurred in January 2020 is easy to catch for audi-
tors. We firmly believe that a flow of funds memo and corresponding wire confirmations do not exist for this 
transaction.


Reason 5: Land Acquisition


We advise the auditors to go over the key issues outlined within the whistle blower lawsuit, as well as other short 
seller reports. For your benefit, Grizzly has compiled the following key things to check into. Note some of which is 
overlapping with previous points. We are restating these in prevention of negligence. 
1. Reconciliation of GSX financials in 2018. GSX financials deviate significantly from China SAIC financials. A 
retrospective examination of bank accounts, taxes filed will be able to indicate this as well.
2. Related Parties: Auditors should investigate the current status of the potentially related parties we identified in 
our report, as well as additional related parties identified by Citron/Scorpio.
3. Order Brushing: Enough has been said regarding this. Simply look at the mountain of data/screenshots and 
other evidence out there that show how many fake students GSX has.
4. Teachers: Grizzly initially identified that GSX teachers were not what they marketed them to be, that many 
were merely cheap new grads with made up profiles. More recently, the website Deloitte watch conducted deep 
dive research and found even more issues regarding their teachers and teacher certificates. Please refer to previ-
ous point.

We believe the key underlying reason that Deloitte cannot issue GSX an audit opinion for 2020 is this: Deloitte 
faces real and serious monetary consequences if they signed off and GSX later turned out to be a fraud. We 
believe it is just a question of when, not if, GSX is widely recognized by even regulators as a fraud. 


There will be severe consequences if Deloitte continues to sign off on GSX. Unlike EY, who got away from a fine 
on Lukin Coffee by not issuing an audit report on their 2019 earnings statement, Deloitte will put itself into huge 
regulatory risks and fines if they choose to sign off on the report. The mountain of evidence that point to GSX 
being a fraud are simply overwhelming. 


Don’t make a mistake about it: GSX might be the biggest capital markets fraud in recent history. We believe the 
company has faked almost its entire financials, and still reached a market capitalization in excess of $30bn. This is 
approximately three times the size of Wirecard at the height of its fraud, and almost measures up to the likes of 
Enron with a market cap close to $60bn before the company blew up. The mind-boggling thing in our mind is 
the scale of the fraud: How could a company that we believe fabricates over 90% of its financials reach this size? 
Future regulators and market participants will look back on this period and rightfully guilt regulators and stake-
holders who failed to protect the public from this fraud.  


While fines for auditors are usually so small that they make committing fraud financially worthwhile, it is other 
penalties that Deloitte should be concerned about. Just recently in 2020, PCAOB imposed a $250,000 penalty on 
Marcum LLP and prohibited the firm from auditing clients in China for three years. The PCAOB and the Securities 
and Exchange Commission have been cracking down on Chinese companies for not complying with PCAOB 
standards and threatened to delist Chinese companies after a string of auditing scandals involving companies 
including Luckin Coffee and GSX Techedu. GSX is currently under investigation by the SEC. 


According to our estimates Deloitte generates approximately $150M in annual revenue from Chinese clients. 


Would Deloitte really want to sacrifice three years of business from so many other Chinese firms for just one firm?

Seven Reasons Why Deloitte CANNOT Sign GSX Annual

GSX is the poster child for everything that is wrong in our current capital markets: Rampant 
market manipulation, crazy leverage, obviously fraudulent financials, and regulators 


failing to act. 


GSX at the Center of Systemic Issues - Stock Manipulation Left and Right
Notably, GSX has been affiliated most recently with convicted stock manipulators. The manipulation played out 
in front of our eyes throughout 2021. We all watched, regulators did nothing. 


After multiple exposes on GSX in mid 2020, option activity suggests that the stock was drive up by gamma 
squeezes. Ridiculous amounts of short dated options were bought and sold to artificially drive up GSX stock 
price. We saw that traders were actively “marking the tape” for GSX, bidding up GSX stock in the final trading 
hour. Whoever was behind this manipulation wanted to keep their identity hidden. As documented here, GSX 
stock has a disproportionate amount of dark pool orders. The majority of GSX shares are held in the name of 
investment banks that have total return swap agreements with investors who are able to conceal their identity 
through this mechanism. Between the disclosed position by Tiger Global and swaps approximately 75% of the 
float was controlled by unknown ultimate beneficiaries. This set the perfect stage for rampant manipulation. 


These manipulations were well documented and exposed. Regulators stood by and did nothing.  


Crazy Leverage Poses Systemic Risk
The true holders of GSX have managed to conceal their identity through total return swap agreements with 
banks. It has been speculated, and we also strongly suspect, that the second main reason for employing total 
return swaps is that it enabled the manipulators to circumvent regulatory leverage restrictions, and possibly, to 
fool investment banks by posting the same collateral for multiple swaps therefore acquiring even more leverage.
The devastating effects of this leverage could be observed on March 26th, when GSX stock dropped by over 50%. 
New outfits reported that block trades were offered by major banks. What triggered this sudden sell off? Invest-
ment banks might have found out that swap holders were violating leverage requirements or other clauses in 
their agreements between the banks and the swap holders. A sell off in an unrelated position might have 
triggered a margin call. Regulators might have contacted the banks, which caused the sudden sell off. Whatever 
the real reason, it is glaringly clear that crazy leverage causes volatility and instability in financial markets. GSX 
showcases the risks embedded in the leverage like no other company in today’s market.

Who is behind the Manipulation Scheme?
Recent news have speculated, and an interview with Julian Robertson seems to confirm, that Tiger cub Bill 
Hwang and his fund Archegos Capital was suffering from recent sell of in GSX, as their positions were forcefully 
liquidated by banks. The story and scale are mind boggling. According to articles Bill Hwang managed to amass a 
$15bn fortune, that we has able to leverage to over $80bn in investments. Take a step back and digest these 
numbers, they are truly unprecedented. Hwang has also been involved, as many Tiger Global alumni, in insider 
trading and his firm paid a sizable fine to the SEC to settle charges. 


Qian Yongqiang, the founder of hedge fund QQQ Capital bragged in Twitter in June that he would personally 
guarantee GSX stock would go above $100. He seems to be involved as well. Another Tiger Global affiliated fund, 
Teng Yue, was also reported to have had sizable losses in GSX’s recent sell off. It seems that a cabal of hedge 
funds, at least partly affiliated with Tiger Global, have coordinated to manipulate GSX’s stock price. We want to 
caution our readers to take these reports with a grain of salt, as they are based on insider talk and not objectively 
verifiable. We also are very skeptical of the assumption that Bill Hwang had personally amassed a $15B fortune, 
given that Tiger Global founder Julian Robertson is listed with a net worth that is only a fraction of this. Only a 
fraction of the truth has come to light so far. Whoever is behind the scheme, the SEC has the authority and duty 
to protect investors form this rampant manipulation by scrupulous hedge funds.

Seven Reasons Why Deloitte CANNOT Sign GSX Annual

Without Referees the Incentives are Perverted
So it turns out that in absence of regulatory intervention, a massive fraud with a tight float is the new favorite 
long play for hedge funds who think of themselves as elaborate players. These are people who love gaming each 
other for profits, they have no regard for any social responsibility as capital allocators and couldn’t care less that 
they are bidding up a complete fraud. 


GSX set the perfect stage for the manipulation: A heavily shorted stock (because it is an obvious fraud), lots of 
liquidity(worthwhile pursuing), a management team that is willing to coordinate(our speculation), a float that 
could be cornered unbeknownst to investors(Thanks to swap agreements with willing investment banks), and 
heavy leverage that can be employed (thanks to investment banks). But the situation needs one more critical 
ingredient to make everything work: Regulators who are unwilling to act. If regulators were to step in and shut 
down GSX stock, and we believe there are many reasons to do so ranging from fraudulent financials to stock 
manipulation, the game ends immediately. We believe what has happened is that after multiple smoking gun 
exposes in mid-2020 some hedge funds were scratching their head why no regulatory intervention happened. 
And when they realized that the referee had left the stadium, they started manipulating the stock more aggres-
sively without consequences thinking of themselves as playing a meta game. The same people are blowing up 
and getting margin calls right now. But this has always been their destiny, after all, we are talking about people 
who like to go 6x leverage in heavily concentrated stock portfolios. In the meantime, the focus of these folks is on 
collecting fees, they don’t care about the societal damage they cause or who they drag down with them in the 
end.  


Games only last so long. The market might be a voting machine in the short run, but it works more like a weigh-
ing machine in the long run. But what can give us confidence that GSX cannot be manipulated upwards again as 
it was done before? Here we come back to the importance of regulatory intervention.  


The capital markets are supposed to give access to capital to good users, and deny access to capital to the 
abusers. If regulators want to preserve this function they have to step in and shut down the most glaring fraud in 
today’s capital market. We appeal once again and will not stop doing so until it is done:


Shut down GSX!
