Summary of Findings: 








 Tibet Water is the most profitable brewer in the world, but we struggled to find its beer 
products in Tibet although the region represents 98% of its sales in the beer segment. 








 The brewery is mainly an OEM that works for another brand, Lhasa beer. This makes its sky-
high margin even more inexplicable. 








 Financial numbers between Tibet Water and Lhasa Beer do not make sense. 
 





 The water business is also very suspicious. For example, we believe the advertising cost is 
substantially understated. 








 Although the Company is supposed to generate ample cash flow and have comfortable 
liquidity, it maintains a high level of debt. 








 The main shareholder has been steadily reducing its stake in Tibet Water. 
 





 Serious doubts over Tibet Water’s accounting and the high probability of fraud make this 
company uninvestible. We call for HKEx to take immediate disciplinary action

1. Tibet Water is mainly a beer OEM and its very high margin is 


inexplicable 





Although Tibet may not be particularly known for its beer one of its companies, Tibet Water 


Resources Ltd (“TW”), is the most profitable brewer in the world. It is also the most profitable 


consumer company listed in Hong Kong. Its Himalayan margins would make any competitor jealous.

TW’s beer business looks simple enough on paper. TW sold around 60,000 tonnes of beer in 2016, 98% 


in Tibet, and the remaining 2% in other regions of China. Its beer is called “Barley Beer”. The 


unimaginative name is not the reason for its success as most beers are produced with barley.  








In order to understand the reasons for Barley Beer’s miraculous profitability, we sent investigators to 


Tibet. We faced our first challenge there: we struggled to find Barley Beer. We failed to uncover them 


in the local food and beverage wholesale markets, neither were we able to find them on TMall or JD.

Tibet does consume beer, but only a limited amount of Barley Beer. If we apply the average 


consumption of beer in China (32 liters per year
1
) to the thinly populated region of Tibet (3 million), 


and we compare this against TW’s annual beer production (60,000 tonnes), we would expect that 


around 59% of all beer consumed in Tibet to be Barley Beer. We should find this brand everywhere, 


which is not the case. 





These findings were confirmed by other sources. We interviewed a current sales manager of a leading 


beer brand with presence in Tibet who provided us a detailed, by-brand volume analysis put together 


by their local sales team in 2016. Per their estimate, Lhasa Beer and Budweiser combined hold more

Iceberg Research

than 80% of the market with the remaining split between CR Beer and Tsingtao. The expert 


confirmed that sales of Barley Beer are very small to the extent that it was excluded in their market 


analysis. Distributors at the market told us that Barley Beer was launched several years ago and didn’t 


fare well because of its premium pricing. We also visited a few local high-end restaurants but were 


unable to locate Barley Beer on their menu.  





We then went to TW’s brewery to try to solve this mystery. We conducted two days of surveillance of 


Barley Beer’s new production facility in Lhasa Economic Development Zone. During the period, we 


observed a total of 13 heavy trucks picking up products from the plant. We found none of those trucks 


carried a single case of Barley Beer. What the trucks picked up was either Lhasa Beer or Lhasa 


Draught. Workers on the ground informed us that most of the beer produced is on an OEM basis.  








Source: Field work 





Based on our observations, we estimate that the plant manufactures between 50,000 and 60,000 tons 


of conventional beer for Lhasa Beer.  





As an OEM, how could TW achieve profitably that competitors with strong brands could only dream 


of? The beer market is hyper competitive, and brand is often the only differentiator. TW’s brewery is 


mostly a bottling facility for Lhasa Beer. Its 58% EBITDA margin is excessive for any business. 


Globally, the best comparative for Green Barley should be the bottling plants for Coca Cola which 


record an EBITDA margin of 8-9% on average.  





Company Name EBITDA Margin % (LTM)

We investigated the relationship between Tibet Water and Lhasa Beer, a beer sold by Tibet Galaxy 


Science Technology Development (“Galaxy”). In its annual report, TW’s biggest beer customer (most 


likely Galaxy) represents only 25% of beer sales, which we believe to be understated.
Iceberg Research 


6 
 





In Lhasa Beer’s annual report, we noticed that Tiandi Green Beverage Development Co., Ltd.’s 


(“Tiandi Green”), TW’s subsidiary that produces beer, has been listed as the largest supplier since 


2013. However, we believe the stated amount procured by TW (RMB122m) is also substantially 


underestimated.  





There are many connections between the two companies. Our field agent was told that the plant was 


only for production purposes and all inquiries on sales and distributorship should be directed to staff 


at the sales company located at 12 Sela North Road, Lhasa. Without surprise, the Company at 12 Sela 


Road is the sales division of Lhasa Beer.  








Mr. Wang Peter Jian who was until recently the main shareholder of TW used to be a controlling 


shareholder of Lhasa Beer.

Financial numbers between TW and Galaxy do not make sense. For example, TW is a much more 


profitable company than Galaxy although it is its OEM.

TW’s average sale price (RMB6,351 per tonne) is much higher than the ASP of Lhasa Beer 


(RMB4,400 per tonne). If Galaxy procures at negative gross margin from TW, we strongly doubt that 


TW’s numbers can be relied upon.  





Another reason for concern is the high price ($1.1b) at which TW acquired 65% of Tiandi Green.

This beer business was worth almost nothing not so long ago. TW acquired its stake in Green Barley 


from seven existing shareholders. Among them we notice one unusual name: Tibet Highland Barley 


Beer Limited (“THBB”).

THBB was a subsidiary of Zhongji Holdings. A news report disclosed that Zhongji bought 31% of 


Tiandi Green from Lhasa Beer (which became Tiandi Green’s customer a few years later) for merely 


RMB3.1m in 2008/2009.
3
 This investment later translated into a total return of RMB527m in 2013. 


Such remarkable return (170x! in four years) in the unexciting beverage business seems simply too 


good to be true. This again raises questions about the true value of Tiandi Green.  





The fortunes of TW turned a few years ago when it lost its contract with China Railway Express 


(“CRE”) as we will explain below. The margins of this business may have been inflated to absorb the 


loss of the CRE business.

2. Water business: our analysis points to the underestimation of costs 
 


The second activity of TW is the production of mineral water, which accounts for 56% of revenue. 


Similar to the beer business, the profitability of the water business is amazingly high with a net profit 


margin of 44%. 





The cost structure of this segment seems extremely aggressive. In particular, we noted that advertising 


cost was only RMB19.7m in 2016. Advertising is generally a major cost for mineral water producers 


who need to differentiate their rather simple product. 
 


 
Source: Company filings 





As a consumer staple company, TW’s marketing expenses amounted to only 2% of their revenue in 


FY16 even when they had just launched a new product (Gesang Spring). TW’s modest RMB20m 


spending on advertising pales in comparison to some of its closest competitors – for example 


Evergrande Ice Spring invested RMB1.3bn in FY15 alone
4
. Is Tibet Water not active in marketing at 


all, or is it covering up its actual expenses? 





TW has been engaged in a multitude of marketing events in 2016.

Iceberg Research

Source: Company presentation 





We believe TW has materially understated its marketing expenses by RMB100m at least. The 


understated marketing expenses inflated reported profit and helped support the share price of TW. As 


detailed in its investor presentation (attached above), TW sponsored a TV show (“Singing Master” 


谁是大歌神) on Zhejiang TV, appointed a celebrity singer Jian Li as its product ambassador, and placed 
the product in various sports/business events. Our analysis shows that the sponsorship of the TV show 


alone cost TW over RMB100m indicating that it has significantly understated its marketing expenses. 





According to a current Zhejiang TV advertisement executive we talked to, sponsorship opportunities 


are highly sought after, especially for shows with high profile celebrities. Despite the high cost, TV 


program sponsorship generates a high ROI and targets nationwide audiences. Singing Master counts a 


long list of heavyweight singers as guest performers including Alan Tam, JJ Lin, Jam Hsiao and Chyi 


Chin. TW is the master sponsor for the program in which a gigantic Gesang Spring bottle was part of 


the opening animation and brand logos were displayed throughout the show. TW on its website 


described the show as “tailor-made” for the marketing of Gesang Spring
5
. The expert believes that the 


total cost should be around RMB100m.

According to a third party viewership tracking agency
6
, Singing Master was the 18


th
 most watched 


entertainment show in the country in 2016 with an average rating of 1.4. Sponsorship costs for 


programs of similar ratings are publicly available. For example, the cost for sponsoring “Come On 


Champion 来吧冠军” was over RMB100m
7
 and that of “I Want to Sing with You 我想和你唱” was above 


RMB120m
8
. Therefore we believe Master Singer will likely cost around RMB100m, consistent with 


what the Zhejiang TV expert told us.

3. High level of debt for a company supposed to be a cash machine and 


puzzling movements in the investment cash flow 
 


TW has benefited from high margins, ample operating cash flow, and a comfortable cash position of 


more than RMB1b. One would expect the company to have no, or almost no, debt. The Company’s 


liquidity has also been helped by its working capital. Cash conversion cycle days shrunk after 2013.

However, the company records a high level of debt with no apparent reason.

Having substantial amount of both cash and debt at the same time has been proven a common red flag 


in Hua Han Health (587 HK), Weiqiao Textile (2698 HK) and Rexlot (555 HK). 





Some Chinese companies may speculate on FX positions, for instance to take advantage of the RMB 


movements against other currencies. However, both debt and cash of TW are mostly denominated in 


RMB.  





Its investment cash flows are also puzzling with very large cash inflow/outflow with third parties 


(amounts below are in RMB thousands). In its annual report, the Company offers no real explanation 


on the rationale for these transactions and the counterparty risks behind them. We find this very 


disturbing.

4. The main shareholder has been steadily reducing its stake 
 


Mr. Wang Peter Jian who used to be the main shareholder of TW has been reducing his stake even 


though TW has recorded exceptional margins and looks like a very promising business. 





 
Source: Capital IQ  








The stake reduction marks the last stage in a reversal of the fortunes of the Company.  





A few years ago, it seemed nothing could stop TW. The rise to fame of the Company was a miracle to 


say the least. Its first production line started in 2006 when it acquired a mining license for the 


extraction of glacier water for a mere consideration of RMB0.5m per year. Less than a year later, it 


was selected as the official drinking water of a wide array of high-profile public events including the 


17
th
 National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Political connections have helped this 


meteoric rise. For example, a founding member of TW is Ms. Li Xiaobing, who is the niece of Deng 


Xiaoping. 





By 2008, TW sold over RMB100m of bottled water to CRE. TW’s premium brand (Tibet 5100) was 


selected as the sole supplier. CRE was such a sweet customer that it not only procured exclusively 


from the Company, but also offered the products for free to its passengers. Otherwise, why would any 


passenger pay at least RMB8 for a bottle of premium water when alternatives from the likes of Master 


Kong were selling at RMB2? The political connections also brought TW into similar deals with other 


government bodies and state-owned enterprises such as Air China at significant volume.  





However, while the situation might have appeared rosy by the time of its IPO, risks were developing 


in the background. In early 2011, the then Minister of Railway Mr. Liu Zhijun and his confidant Mr. 


Zhang Shuguang were dismissed, and were later found guilty of receiving more than RMB100m in 


bribes. CRE was severely corrupted at the time.
10








Skepticism on the legitimacy of TW’s supply contract rose
11


 but it didn’t dampen TW’s IPO, at least 


not till the IPO was safely completed. In July 2011, merely two weeks after its debut trading, TW 


announced that CRE would cut its annual procurement volume from 150,000 tons to 50,000 tons. The 


timing of the decision couldn’t be more perfect – had it come a month earlier TW would never be able 


to go public again and shareholders would also be unable to exit the broken business.  





In the following years, the investors of the Company would see the procurement volume from CRE 


continue to shrink until CRE terminated the contract altogether in 2015.

http://business.sohu.com/20111103/n324331757.shtml
Iceberg Research 


15 
 





Losing CRE was a devastating blow to the founders – the value of their shares were almost halved by 


the end of 2011. The largest shareholder Mr. Wang Jian sold 200m shares at HK$1.75 per share (50% 


off IPO price) in Mar 2012 – that was how badly the founder wanted to exit the business. We believe 


it was also around the same time when the founder probably realized that there simply wasn’t enough 


demand for them to exit the business completely, even at dirt cheap prices.  





TW also sought help from stock market manipulators in supporting their share price in preparation for 


what we expect is a final exit. We found that Kingston Securities, a notorious market manipulator
12


, 


has been a key market intermediary for TW since 2016.  
 


 
Source: HKEX 








Now, after a series of sell-down, the controlling shareholder holds less than one third of its original 


holdings at the time of IPO.

5. Conclusion 


 
TW shows all the signs of financial fraud: a product we struggle to find, profitability that does not 


make sense for what is fundamentally an OEM business, inexplicable cost structure, high debt while 


the company is cash rich... 
 


It is very likely that TW’s misrepresentations will soon come to an end after the main shareholder 


reduced its stake. 
 


We believe TW is uninvestible at present. We expect the share price to collapse. There is a high risk 


that the auditor resigns and the company gets delisted.
