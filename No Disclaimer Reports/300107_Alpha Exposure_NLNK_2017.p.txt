Summary


We believe Newlink data-mined for trial “success”


Short Ideas Healthcare


LUMO


Newlink’s Phase 2 data for indoximod and Keytruda for advanced melanoma have
serious flaws.


The trial “results” excluded nearly 50% of enrolled patients, which we believe made
the trial results look significantly better.


The trial also included healthier patients which skewed the results in Newlink’s
favor.


A deeper analysis of the trial results shows that indoximod is ineffective and
underwhelming versus the competition.


We are short Newlink and believe the stock has a downside of 100%.

Why we believe excluding nearly 50% of the patient population is
important


When analyzing biotech companies, we’ve consistently warned investors about
companies that data-mine to show successful trial results. In the majority of cases, the
data-mining and statistical sleight of hand is subtle as companies slice and dice data in
sophisticated ways to generate positive results.


In Newlink’s (NLKL) case, the company took a hatchet to the Phase 2 trial results to
generate positive data. It wasn’t particularly sophisticated, and we’re surprised investors
fell for it and drove the stock up 75% and 30% on consecutive days.


The market’s reaction appears misguided and we think the true results of the trial are
underwhelming. It’s clear that Newlink excluded a significant part of the trial’s total
patient population, and we believe the exclusion of these patients served to flatter the
trial's results.


Prior corporate presentations clearly show that the Phase 2 trial actually enrolled 94
patients in the indoximod and pembrolizumab (Keytruda) combination arm (source here,
slide 7). However, when analyzing the efficacy endpoints, Newlink only included patients
from that arm who had stayed on the trial for 12-weeks until the first imaging results.
This removed 34 patients or 36% of the patient population. Newlink then excluded an
additional 9 patients with uveal melanoma. The remaining 51 patient sub-group was
54%, or just over half, of the original patient population for the indoximod plus Keytruda
arm.


It was in this significantly reduced patient sub-group that Newlink claimed promising
ORR%, CR%, and PFS results of 61%, 20%, and 12.9 months, respectively, in its press
release on Thursday, September 7, 2017 (source here, slide 21).

Newlink claims it excluded the 34 patients because the company only analyzed
“evaluable” patients. We believe this explanation is misleading. At the most basic level,
the 34 excluded patients simply didn’t remain on trial through week 12 (i.e. 3 months)
when their first images were supposed to be taken after initiation of therapy. This means
that if someone in the trial died in the second month of treatment or got much sicker and
chose not do the imaging, that patient would be excluded from an analysis such as the
one performed by Newlink. While the company’s exclusion criteria may initially sound
reasonable, we believe Newlink did it in order to make the results of the trial appear
more favorable.


The how and why is straightforward. This is a trial in advanced melanoma. Patients
have visible tumors on their skin and have seen their disease progress to an advanced
stage. These patients and their doctors can observe when their skin lesions shrink or
grow and can quickly make decisions on whether to stay on trial or try other treatments.


Per the trial protocol, patients initiate treatment and continue until disease progression
or toxicity (source here, slide 6). A full cycle of therapy is about 4 weeks (source here),
which is well before the company’s 12-week imaging cut off.


We believe these 34 excluded patients fall into one of four groups.


They left the trial after enrolling and didn’t receive treatment at all. This is rare, but as
explained below these patients are still usually included in the analysis of pivotal
trials.


1.


They left the trial after initiating treatment, but before the per protocol treatment
regimen is over.


2.


They completed at least one full treatment cycle (~1 month) but left after seeing
disease progression before week 12.


3.


They have remained on trial but haven’t yet reached the 12-week mark for imaging.
This could happen, but the number of evaluable patients did not grow between
Newlink’s initial data presentation in April 2017 (source here, slide 9) and its
presentation last week, which rules out this explanation.


4.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4106042-newlink-and-curious-case-of-missing-patients 4/12


Since group 4 can be eliminated here, we conclude that this means that the 34 excluded
patients must fit into groups 1, 2, or 3. The trials Newlink presents as comparable trials
all include patients who never receive treatment or leave the trial early. By excluding
these patients, Newlink inflates its ORR% and CR% results, especially in comparison to
the trials to which Newlink compares indoximod. We believe Newlink is particularly
misleading because it excludes group 3, or people who progress early. Historically, the
FDA requires that clinical trials include all patient groups in any analysis such as ORR%
and CR% since they fall into the intent to treat (ITT) population (source here, page 67,
section 8.1.4 Intent-to-Treat Analysis). As per the FDA’s Good Review Process, ITT
analysis “reduces the risk that bias will be introduced during the trial (dropping patients
with an apparent poor prognosis in one arm) or during the analysis (excluding patients
from the analysis because they are not evaluable).”


Essentially, Newlink appears to have excluded negative patient results by setting an
arbitrary cutoff point of 12 weeks post-initiation of treatment. We believe this was
particularly flattering to Newlink because it would exclude patients with early disease
progression. Disease progression is easy to track because melanoma lesions are
visible, and these are late stage melanoma patients who see and consult their doctors
regularly. In addition, since the safety results of the trial are good, we don’t believe many
patients exited due to toxicity issues.


Including these patients would make the trial’s ORR%, CR%, and PFS results appear
much worse. A proper assessment of the patients enrolled in this trial would assess all
of the patients who the company intended to treat (i.e. the ITT) population. It is fine to
describe a “per protocol” population but including the latter absent the former is
inconsistent with best practices as guided by the FDA.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4106042-newlink-and-curious-case-of-missing-patients 5/12


Rightfully including these randomized patients into the ORR% and CR% calculation
makes the calculations worse because it increases the number of patients in the
denominator. Instead of having a smaller figure of “evaluable” patients in the
denominator, the ORR% and CR% calculations would include the larger total patient
number and include patients who progressed early. It would also significantly lower the
reported 12.9 month PFS figure since this calculation would include patients who
progressed before the first 3-month imaging cutoff.


If we include these randomized patients in our adjusted ORR% analysis, the ORR%
goes from 61% to 39% and the CR% goes from 20% to 13%, which are unimpressive
results for the indoximod + pembrolizumab combo. In fact, it suggests that indoximod
has no additional efficacy versus pembrolizumab alone. We couldn’t make a similar
adjustment for the PFS calculation because the data has not been disclosed by Newlink
or the investigators.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/4106042-newlink-and-curious-case-of-missing-patients 6/12


We want to make clear that it is highly unusual for proper clinical trials to exclude
patients who don’t stay on trial for a long enough period of time, especially if they’ve
received drug treatment. All three of the nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and nivolumab +
ipilimumab trials to which Newlink compared its results calculated ORR% and CR% on
an ITT basis, meaning the trial took all-comers and did not exclude people who didn’t
stay in the trial long enough for imaging. This is considered best practice. In fact, all
three trials even included patients who didn’t undergo a full regimen of treatment or
didn’t receive treatment at all in their calculations.


While Incyte (INCY) and Merck (MRK) in their co-sponsored Phase 2 trial for
epacadostat and pembrolizumab in advanced melanoma followed a similar procedure
as Newlink through week 9 of imaging, the trial still included the vast majority (84%) of
patients in their ORR% and CR% analyses, which makes for more trustworthy results, in
our opinion, than the results presented by Newlink. In addition, the most common
reason Incyte patients were excluded is because they hadn’t received the scan yet. This
is appropriate because the patients are still considered on study. In contrast, it doesn’t
appear that Newlink had similar on study patients that it excluded since the patient count
did not increase between the original report in April and last week’s update.

Another difference between the Newlink trial and the Incyte trial is that the Phase 2
epacadostat and pembrolizumab trial’s imaging cutoff was at 9 weeks, which is almost a
month earlier than Newlink’s imaging cutoff of 12 weeks. We believe this longer imaging
cutoff gave Newlink two advantages. First, it was able to exclude patients progressing
between weeks 9 and 12, which reduced the number of patients in the evaluable
subgroup and generated higher ORR% and CR% rates than the trial would have seen
under a 9-week cutoff point. Second, it increased the chances of having responding
patients see enough tumor shrink to count as partial responses because of the longer
treatment time during which patients received Keytruda.

We believe the sell-side has missed Newlink’s sub-group reporting


The indoximod trial had healthier patients


We believe Newlink’s excluded patients are likely to be patients with worse outcomes,
and at the very least they increase the denominator when calculating ORR% and CR%.
This fact should not be overlooked. Taking the ORR% and CR% on an all-comers basis
makes indoximod’s data unimpressive.


We think it is worth pointing out that the sell-side analysts who breathlessly covered the
updated data from Newlink last week made no mention of these missing patients and
the sub-group nature of the analysis. Neither the SunTrust nor the Stifel analyst even
mentioned that the data set excluded nearly half of the trial’s enrolled patients. The
Cantor Fitzgerald analyst, in his September 10, 2017, report, only mentioned the trial’s
small size, stating “We acknowledge a single arm trial without a comparator is a
vulnerability.” Lastly, the Jefferies analyst, in his September 8, 2017, report, stated that
Newlink’s data is comparable to the Incyte trial “based on the comparison between all
comer patients in two studies.” That is simply wrong since neither trial provided data on
an ITT basis.


We believe that Newlink has not made clear to investors that it excluded nearly half of
the enrolled patients in the Phase 2 trial and relied on sub-group analysis to present
positive results that don't conform with best practices. For instance, no mention of the
trial’s total enrollment figures were made in last week’s press release. If this had been
made clearer and had the analysts rightfully noted this shortcoming, we believe
Newlink’s stock reaction would be much different.

Three ways in which we believe Newlink positively skewed the trial
results


We also note that Newlink’s patients are healthier on average than the other trials to
which the company provides a comparison. This should lead to better results for
Newlink, but it appears to have been overlooked by the market. The biggest difference
between the comparable trials is a lower percentage of patients in the most advanced
Stage IV M1c stage of disease for Newlink. Stage IV M1c stage patients have the worst
prognosis (source here). We believe fewer M1c patients is a significant positive bias in
the trial's favor. At a minimum, we believe this difference in baseline patient
characteristics is important and should be fully noted.


The Phase 2 ECOG scores in the trial population are also on average better than the
comparator trials. A lower ECOG status is associated with better outcomes (source
here). As seen below, Newlink’s patient population had ECOG scores that were on the
lower end versus the comparable trials.


We note that this was a small, single arm, open-label, non-randomized trial. Small
biases can have large impacts in such trials, and we believe Newlink had two prognostic
factors that skewed its Phase 2 trial positively (cancer staging and ECOG status).
Nevertheless, on an unadjusted basis, as shown above, the indoximod and
pembrolizumab patients had worse ORR% and CR% outcomes, which makes this
combo an inferior option to the competition.

Newlink is desperate for a legitimate pipeline candidate and is running
out of cash.


To review, we believe there are three things happening with Newlink’s indoximod and
pembrolizumab Phase 2 trial that investors should be aware of:


Newlink excluded a significant portion of the trial’s patient population, many of which
we believe progressed early in the trial.


1.


Newlink excluded uveal melanoma patients in a post-hoc manner. While this makes
the trial consistent with the comparable trials, this is still a post-hoc adjustment that
we believe was made to superficially flatter the results.


2.


The trial’s patients are healthier than its comparators’ trials.3.


In the past 18 months, Newlink has failed its IMPRSS Phase 3 trial for algenpantucel-L
in pancreatic cancer ( here), had its next-generation IDO-inhibitor GDC-919 returned by
its partner Genentech ( here) after disappointing Phase 1 results ( here), and appears to
have largely moth-balled its efforts in Ebola and Zika vaccines. Indoximod is now
Newlink’s only development stage asset, and indoximod’s previous trial results so far
have been disappointing.


In addition, Newlink is running low on cash. On the 2Q earnings call (here), Newlink
stated it will end 2017 with $75 million of cash. Cash burn in 2017 is expected to be
approximately $60 million, and 2018 cash burn is likely to rise significantly due to the
pivotal trial for indoximod that Newlink is planning.

Top shipping & supply chain stocks - just $99/year
While the market flounders, a unique opportunity has emerged in shipping stocks.  


J Mintzmyer and his team of analysts have spent a decade covering supply chain
dynamics with unparalleled precision and expertise. 


Last year, J’s model portfolio for Value Investor’s Edge generated a total return of
136%. And through July 15, his portfolio is up 23% YTD, and is beating the market


In fact, Newlink recently used it's at the market (ATM) facility and sold shares at under
$8.00 to boost liquidity (source here, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources”). This is a
really clear signal of what Newlink’s management thinks the value of their stock is. They
were willing to sell stock at under $8.00. In addition, Newlink’s co-founder, Chairman,
CEO, and Chief Scientific Officer Charles Link sold shares earlier this year at $11.04
and $10.28 per share (link here). With the shares above $17, we believe investors
should be fearful of significant dilution soon.


We are short Newlink with a price target of $0


For the reasons above, we believe indoximod is an unattractive pipeline candidate, and
we think that Newlink is quickly burning through cash developing an ineffective asset.
We don’t believe indoximod has any value, especially considering the competitive
landscape. Furthermore, we believe Newlink will deplete its cash resources within the
next 18 months. Our target price is $0/share.
