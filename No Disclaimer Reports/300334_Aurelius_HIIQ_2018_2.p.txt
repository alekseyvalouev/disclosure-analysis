Why Would HIIQ Sell Policies
from This Boca Raton Insurer?


NOVEMBER 30, 2018 | HIIQ


“HIIQ Partners with Best In-Class Carriers” – November 2018 HIIQ
Investor Presentation


Documents reveal that HIIQ has sold a signi�cant amount of policies
from a Boca Raton insurer with less than $7 million in capital and
ties to previous insurance frauds, further calling into question HIIQ
management’s credibility and claims about its compliance. The CEO
and CFO of the insurer, American Financial Security Life Insurance
Company (“AFSLI”), held executive positions at a fraudulent
insurance company that collapsed in 2009, leading to criminal
indictments of two other o�cers. AFSLI’s CEO, Michael Camilleri, is
the registered agent and attorney for companies the FTC recently
declared were “permeated by fraud” and owned by Steven Dorfman,
an individual allegedly a�liated with organized crime.


HIIQ claims that the insurers who underwrite it’s polices are “best-in-
class carriers with whom we have nurtured long-standing
relationships”.  The company’s SEC �lings and pitchbooks
speci�cally name large carriers such as Chubb, Standard Life, and
Everest.   That’s why we were surprised to learn that undercover FTC
investigators were sold HIIQ policies underwritten by AFSLI this year
(below).

(Above: Capture of a HIIQ policy sold to undercover FTC
investigators)


AFSLI’s CEO is an attorney named Michael Camilleri and its CFO is
an accountant named John S. Maloney.  Both are former Directors of
First Commercial Insurance Company (“FCIC”), where Camilleri was
the General Counsel and Maloney the CFO.  FCIC collapsed in 2009
after �ling false �nancial reports leading to the criminal
indictments of two other executives for fraud (neither Camilleri or
Maloney were charged, Maloney resigned in 2007).  In addition to
“worthless cash assets”, the Florida Department of Financial
Services also discovered that “FCIC sold 2,000 automobile service
warranty policies that were not re�ected on the company’s books”.

Camilleri and Maloney moved to AFSLI which purchased its Boca
Raton o�ce from the FCIC receiver in 2012, according to deed
records (We note that AFSLI has recently put this o�ce up for sale). 
Members of AFSLI’s Board of Directors currently include an auto
mechanic and a paralegal who were found to lack “business acumen
and experience in the �eld of insurance” during a routine 2014
regulatory examination.


We discovered that Camilleri is also an attorney for Dorfman. 
Florida Corporate records from March 2018 show that Camilleri is
the “Attorney in Fact” for entities including Senior Bene�ts One,
which is speci�cally named in the FTC’s complaint. Recall that bank

records prove HIIQ paid $145 million in cash to Dorfman’s
companies before the government placed them in receivership.


Records also show Mr. Camilleri has previously represented
individuals tied to health insurance scams:


In 2012, Camilleri was named as a defendant in a class
action suit by plaintiffs who claimed they were scammed
after purchasing “fraudulent and/or worthless insurance
plans” from a New Jersey boiler room operation. Camilleri
allegedly “retained and misappropriated” $1.6 million in
premiums entrusted by a client “in order to evade attempts
by the class to collect judgements”.  Although the suit was
later dismissed, the Department of Justice brought a 57-

count indictment against 4 participants “for their role in a
national health care scheme that defrauded more than
17,000 victims” (Note: Neither Mr. Camilleri or his client were
indicted).


In 2013, Camilleri represented a boiler room named PJP
Health accused of “misleading consumers by telling them
they were purchasing major medical coverage”. PJP employed
Philip and Joseph Teseo, former Stratton Oakmont Brokers
who are permanently banned from the securities business
after pleading guilty to felonies.


Are investors to believe this is all merely a coincidence? We doubt
that Chubb, Standard Life, and Everest have extensive histories with
people tied to such scams or convicted of fraud.


Yet AFLISC’s regulatory �lings indicate that premiums written
doubled to $12.5 million through the �rst nine months of this year
(below).  If these numbers are to be relied upon, this means that
AFSLIC could represent as much as 11% of HIIQ’s business and is
growing quickly.  Why has HIIQ been selling more policies from
AFSLIC? What purpose does AFSLIC serve HIIQ?

 Source: AFSLIC NAIC �ling.  Note that HIIQ reported paying $111.6
million in YTD Risk Premiums to carriers during �rst nine months of
this year, suggesting that AFSLIC could represent as much as 11% of
HIIQ’s business.


We are informed that management has suggested to investors and
analysts in private this week that it will reach a favorable settlement
with the 42-state investigation prior to its upcoming analyst day. 
While we have no idea if this is true, a sell side analyst wrote that
management also denied having anyone “sketchy or remotely
sketchy” left in its network.  Yet seemingly everywhere we look we
see sketchy operators, AFSLIC being the latest example.  We believe
management lacks credibility and we are short HIIQ shares.
