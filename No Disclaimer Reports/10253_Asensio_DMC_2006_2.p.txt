DMC: One More For The


Movies


Document Security Systems, Inc. (AMEX: DMC, $8.01)


announced on August 01, 2005 that the company was suing


the European Central Bank (“ECB”) and seeking to recover


damages “at a rate of a reasonable royalty” based on a claim


that every Euro banknote in circulation infringes on DMC’s


patent “covering anti-counterfeiting technology.”


That is a pretty lofty statement for a company that went


public in November 1985 as a “developer and producer of


theatrical motion pictures” and was incorporated in 1983 as


Thoroughbreds, Inc. Very lofty indeed, for a company that


tried, unsuccessfully to cash in on the dotcom mania and


then produced such forgettable B-list fare as “The


Godmother” and “Freak Talks About Sex.”


DMC, which was formerly known as New Sky


Communications (“New Sky”) changed its name to Document


Security Systems on February 3, 2003 subsequent to New


Sky’s acquisition of three businesses, which were and remain


a group of tiny, low margin, low growth printing and paper


distribution companies with immaterial sales.


Prior to New Sky’s entry into what it calls “the document


security business,” it had 2,238,975 shares outstanding with


a market value of a mere $358,236. Currently DMC has

12,844,313 shares outstanding and a market value of about


$102.8 million.


In 2002, New Sky acquired Document Security Consultants,


Inc., as well as “all of the corporate stock” of Lester Levin, Inc.


and Thomas M. Wicker Enterprises Inc. in August of 2002.


In 2002, New Sky also completed a private placement of


5,000,000 shares of at a price of $0.10 a share, or a total of


just $500,000. According to the Form 10-Q for the period


ended June 30, 2002 New Sky had no revenues, and no cash


prior to the acquisition of the above noted “security


document” and printing companies.


New Sky paid $72,000 in cash and issued 125,000 shares of


common stock for Document Security Consultants.


Document Security Consultant’s President David Wicker, a


former bookbindery foreman, is now DMC’s Vice President of


Operations and Technology.


The Wicker family connection continued with the purchase


of Thomas M. Wicker Enterprises, Inc (“TMW”) for 1,000,000


shares, which at the time of their issuance had a market


value of $140,000. After the acquisition, Thomas Wicker,


formerly an auto mechanic, assumed the title of Director of


Research and Development and is currently the Chief


Technology O�cer at DMC.


The biggest deal was received by Patrick White, a longtime


business associate of the Wickers for the acquisition of


Lester Levin, Inc., which was doing business as Patrick


Printing. For Lester Levin, Inc., New Sky issued 750,000


shares of stock with a market value of $105,000, and the


assumption of $324,921.26 in debt.


To round out DMC’s executive “Dream Team” after the


acquisitions, New Sky employed Patrick White as President,


Chief Executive O�cer (“CEO”) and Chairman.

The developer of the technology which DMC claims the ECB


is infringing upon is Ralph Wicker, who is the late father of


David and Thomas Wicker. Ralph and Thomas Wicker


unsuccessfully sued the United States Treasury Department


in 1995 claiming that the U.S. $100 bill unveiled in 1995


infringed upon intellectual properties covered by Ralph


Wicker’s patents.


The lawsuit against the United States Treasury Department


in fact had the opposite e�ect. As a result of the lawsuit


against the United States Treasury Department certain


claims of the Wicker’s Patent numbers 5,018,767 and


5,193,853 were found to be invalidated due to obviousness


and the case was dismissed. The dismissal and resulting in


the invalidation of these certain claims, was upheld on


appeal.


When announcing DMC’s lawsuit against the ECB, Tom


Wicker stated “Our father, Ralph Wicker, was the original


inventor of these technologies. He passed away knowing


that many governments and corporations were infringing on


our patents but our family lacked the resources to enforce


these rights. We joined forces with Document Security


Systems in part so that we would have the resources and


corporate structure to not only address what we consider to


be the wrongful use of our technologies but also to provide a


platform for marketing and licensing our newer and more


powerful anti-counterfeiting technologies in the future.”


If the Wickers have valid claims against governments, and


banks and major institutions in the Checks and Forms


industry it is almost incredulous to think that they would use


a former B-list production house with no cash, funding


resources, and a long list of failed schemes, as a platform to


validate their late father’s claims.


Maybe the Wicker’s are in the wrong business and should


have stuck with DMC’s movie production roots. To hear the


Wickers tell their story it has all the makings of a great �lm. Privacy  - Terms
