ViaSat considers itself a leader in satellite technology, capable of producing bandwidth 
economics competitors can’t match. For the sliver of revenue generated from delivering 
broadband to an airplane, that may be true. For the 70% of EBITDA that comes from delivering 
broadband to homes and small businesses, it is not. ViaSat provides inferior technology in a 
hyper-competitive market. The company’s main business is selling satellite-based basic home 
internet service to U.S. consumers. Unfortunately, its technology is no match for terrestrial 
internet providers today, let alone over the next few years as terrestrial competitors dramatically 
increase speed, capacity and coverage through rapid technological advancements. For ViaSat, 
forced to compete against terrestrial by launching satellites that exhaust capacity in 2-year 
cycles, U.S. residential broadband is a terrible business destined to fail.  
 
Longs believe ViaSat is insulated from robust competition by its focus on rural households. They 
believe ViaSat should thrive in a large addressable market of underserved homes, using leading 
satellite technology to take share against legacy telco and cable operators. Once ViaSat-2 is 
operational, subscriber trends will meaningfully improve – that’s when a stock stuck in neutral 
for nearly 4 years will finally lift off. 
 
Every part of this bull thesis is critically flawed.  
 
Based on both speed and capacity, the company’s value proposition has lost every shred of 
commercial viability since its last satellite launch. Sell-side estimates that call for a tripling of 
gross subscriber additions, stable churn (customer disconnects), rising margins, and continued 
inflated ARPU growth are wildly unrealistic. Investors underappreciate the magnitude and timing 
of technology improvements in competing terrestrial networks that directly impact ViaSat’s 
target market. VDSL, G.fast, DOCSIS 3.1 and fiber roll-outs are dramatically improving the 
capability and coverage of landline networks. Wireless 4G LTE is ubiquitous, unlimited data 
plans are offered by all four major carriers, and massive increases in spectral efficiency are 
fueling exponential gains in mobile speed and capacity. The changes in technology are not 
science fiction nor progressing slowly over many years. The competitive advantage that drove 
ViaSat’s subscriber performance with the launch of ViaSat-1 five years ago no longer exists. 
ViaSat-2 will not drive substantial subscriber growth and ViaSat-3 will have stranded capacity.  
 
Satellite consumer home internet – like pagers, Blackberries, pay phones and VHS players – 
will soon become nearly extinct in the United States, a tiny footnote in the technological 
landscape with products owned by a negligible fraction of households. 
 
Like many technology businesses facing near-term obsolescence, ViaSat uses non-core 
products and misleading reporting metrics to disguise its doomed principal business.  One 
particular aggressive tactic has been to use classic telecom gimmicks to inflate average 
revenue per user (ARPU). For the past 3 years, ViaSat has been jamming customers with 
commoditized add-ons like VoIP for $29.99/mo., “priority access” customer support for 
$5.99/mo., and anti-virus for $2.99/mo. These temporary ARPU contributions will erode under 
competitive pressure, just like charging for caller ID, voicemail, and call-waiting did for legacy 
wireline carriers. ARPU forecasts across the Street do not properly account for the high level of 
non-bandwidth revenues that are unsustainable in a competitive environment. When ARPU 
inevitably declines, so will EBITDA estimates and DCF-driven price targets.

To add insult to injury, while ViaSat waits 9 more months for its next satellite to be operational, 
EchoStar’s new Jupiter 2 is in the market now, poaching the few final adopters of satellite home 
internet. ViaSat is currently slashing prices to avoid losing a tenth of its customers before the 
end of the year.  
 
Amid this deteriorating competitive position, the company is burning cash and tapping the 
capital markets for external funding. Since becoming a satellite services company, ViaSat has 
never generated positive free cash flow. The last time the company needed funding, it sold 
$500m of equity (14% dilutive) at a price near current trading levels. ViaSat needs the capital 
markets for another $1bn+ of capital over the next few years, which it will then invest in a 
business – satellite consumer home broadband – that will have mostly disappeared in the 
United States within 5 to 10 years.  The company withholds disclosures required to accurately 
assess the health of the consumer broadband business, downplays the unit’s eroding 
competitiveness, and inflates metrics used in valuation, all to retain necessary access to the 
capital markets. 
 
ViaSat is not an innovative company taking share from legacy telco – it is legacy telco. 
Subscriber metrics will woefully underperform expectations and it won’t be long until the market 
realizes that satellite-based residential internet is a business in terminal secular decline. We 
place fair value at $35, or 50%+ downside.

I. Investment Highlights 
 


ARPU will not inexorably rise as forecast by the Street. It will decline. A key assumption in 


Wall Street models and valuations is that average revenue per user (ARPU) will continue to rise 


off current inflated levels.1 This view is flawed because it ignores how fragile ViaSat’s ARPU has 


become. After years of bandwidth constraints, 40% of ARPU is now derived from charging 


for commoditized equipment, non-core services, and add-ons. This weak foundation to 


ARPU is poorly understood by investors because of the company’s inadequate disclosures. The 


company’s ability to continue charging for non-core services will erode as competition continues 


to intensify.  


 Beginning in 2014, in the wake of a strategic mistake that left ViaSat without additional 


bandwidth to sell, the company began emphasizing the sale of non-bandwidth “value-


added” services. 


 Commoditized offerings such as VoIP, Wi-Fi modems, anti-virus protection, and even 


better customer care began to increasingly drive ARPU growth – a trend that noticeably 


accelerated in the last twelve months (+13% in the most recent reporting period).  


 The ability to charge extra for services that are included by competitors will eventually 


result in margin attrition as these highly profitable extras are ultimately included in basic 


service. The loss of these non-core service revenues will lead to lower overall ARPU. 


 The company inflated ARPU for 3 main reasons, none of which are sustainable: 


1. Without additional satellite capacity, the company has aggressively pursued a 


rate versus volume strategy over the past 3 years. ViaSat has systematically 


allowed lower-value subscribers to disconnect, while selectively retaining and 


targeting subscribers to whom they can upsell add-on products. This is not the 


strategy that will be employed when they attempt to move upmarket with ViaSat-


2.2 


2. EchoStar, their main satellite competitor, has also faced capacity constraints 


during the past 18 months. In other words, ViaSat has not had to defend its 


subscriber base against EchoStar and has been able to get away with 


uncompetitive pricing actions. That changed a few months ago when EchoStar’s 


Jupiter 2 became fully operational.  


3. The company needs cash to fund ongoing satellite development and 


acquisitions, and so must demonstrate near-term revenue growth to win over 


investors. With subscriber levels getting worse, the only way to show growth in 


consumer broadband was to find contrived ways to grow ARPU through non-


bandwidth related products. ARPU rose +11% in the September quarter of last 


year, driven by the introduction of non-bandwidth products. Ten days after 


earnings, the company announced a $500m equity offering to help fund their next 


satellite program. It inflated a metric the Street relies on, without providing 


granularity, so that analysts would believe growth was more sustainable than it 


truly is. In the most recent quarter, the company tempered Street expectations for 


growth in consumer broadband, stating that revenues would be closer to flat due 


                                                
1 Post the November 2016 equity offering, several bulge bracket investment banks initiated coverage of ViaSat.  We 


found none that projected a decline in ARPU.  Street estimates range from +2-9% ARPU increase in FY2018.     
2 The primary source of current satellite capacity is ViaSat-1.  ViaSat-2 was launched on June 1, 2017 and is slated 


for operational service beginning in 1Q18.  See Section II – Company Overview for more details.

to continued subscriber losses and ARPU that only “may” compensate for 


continued subscriber declines.3  


 Forecasts must recognize the inevitability that ARPU will fall and the impact to 


valuation will be significant. 75% of forecasted EBITDA growth over the next 3 years 


is driven by consistent increases of a metric inflated by products and services with no 


enduring value. The primary valuation method employed for all satellite companies is a 


DCF, which in ViaSat’s case is mostly based on the terminal value given the company’s 


lack of free cash flow well until the next decade. Even small changes in ARPU drives a 


meaningful decline in valuation. This risk is not priced correctly in the stock. 





Despite new, larger satellites, the company continues to lose competitive ground. Bulls 


focus on comparing ViaSat-2 to ViaSat-1 in formulating subscriber forecasts. The more critical 


analysis is how ViaSat-2 will be positioned versus terrestrial operators in 2018 and how the 


once favorable competitive landscape has decidedly moved against them. Whether comparing 


speed or capacity, satellite-based residential broadband is being rendered obsolete.  


 In 2012, ViaSat offered a compelling speed/value proposition of $50 for 12Mbps 


download speeds. In bandwidth economic terms, it sold speed for $4 Mbps/mo., a 


substantial discount to DSL ($32 Mbps/mo.) and even cable ($8 Mbps/mo.).4  Wireless 


was not a realistic home broadband solution.  


 In 2018, when ViaSat-2 will become operational after a year-long delay, the company 


will likely offer speeds of 25Mbps-50Mbps priced at $50-$75 a month – a premium 


speed/value proposition. Even wireless is now compelling on a speed/value basis, 


making it a ubiquitous, viable home broadband solution that will get dramatically better in 


the near future with advancements in spectral efficiency.  


 ViaSat-2’s positioning on data capacity is even worse. In 2012, the company initially 


capped data at 10-15GB (1/3 of average US household consumption at the time). 


ViaSat-2 will likely double the level at which data restrictions will apply, but average 


household consumption since ViaSat-1’s launch has quadrupled to 190GB per month. 


Cable and DSL have kept up with ease and wireless is now unlimited. ViaSat will still 


have to provision capacity on a per subscriber level well below average consumption. 


 The speed and capacity improvements of ViaSat-3 U.S. (the first of a planned 3-satellite 


constellation scheduled to launch in late 2019/2020) will not match the advancements 


that will have been achieved by terrestrial competitors by the time the satellite is 


launched. ViaSat’s upcoming satellites are not closing the gap or facilitating any move 


upmarket. They are evidence of the company’s increasing irrelevance in residential 


broadband. 





The addressable market is much smaller than bulls believe and shrinking fast. Target 


addressable market estimates of 13-14m+ homes are built on faulty and outdated assumptions. 


The true figure is far smaller and contracting quickly.  


 Many analysts cite a 2016 FCC report on the number of homes that lack 25MBps 


download speed without recognizing that the figure fell -40% year-over-year.5

 Broadband availability and broadband adoption are two very different things. The 


number of Americans who can and would be willing to pay for broadband internet is the 


relevant statistic, not simply the number of Americans who do not have it. Layering in 


socio-economic factors, housing statistics and adoption rates yields a substantially lower 


addressable market. The pool of economically attractive, underserved customers 


available to ViaSat is rapidly shrinking. 


 Bullish views on the addressability of the “low-speed” DSL market fail to account for how 


poorly ViaSat has historically competed against DSL, the advancements in DSL 


technology, and the meaningful discount at which DSL is priced. ViaSat may offer an 


attractive speed offering (to a rapidly dwindling number of homes) but DSL subscribers 


do not value speed in the same way as other subscribers – they are attracted to plans 


that are priced -30-40% below ViaSat’s cheapest offerings.  


 ViaSat’s subscriber acquisition costs prevent them from meaningfully discounting price 


to a level that would entice DSL customers.  


 Bullish shareholders fail to recognize how the erosion in ViaSat’s speeds clearly 


illustrates the company’s inability to add anywhere near the millions of subscribers that 


the company touts as its addressable market, even with multiple terabits of additional 


capacity. ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3 will never meaningfully challenge the DSL market.  





Reported EBITDA is overstating profitability. Reported EBITDA has increasingly captured 


material amounts of equipment-related lease revenue without any corresponding cash expense.  


 We conservatively estimate reported EBITDA includes $120m in consumer broadband-


related equipment revenue that has no appropriate level of costs netted against it. The 


proper way to represent the true cash profitability of the company would be to include an 


adjustment for the depreciation expense related to these equipment sales. Adjusting 


EBITDA in this manner to arrive at “cash EBITDA” is standard practice in the telecom 


industry and used by equity research analysts in deriving valuation. In the case of 


ViaSat, it would reduce reported FY 2017 EBITDA by -18%. 


 We believe the company has deliberately structured its subscription and add-on plans in 


specific ways to take advantage of accounting rules to flatter its primary valuation metric, 


EBITDA. On an EBIT and FCF basis, it’s clear the company is not highly profitable and 


is significantly overvalued.  





The company has never generated a decent ROIC. Bulls believe that the ROI for ViaSat-1 


(touted as meeting expectations by the company but without any granular verification) and 


ViaSat-2 justify the worthiness of the business model. Their beliefs are flawed. 


 The target ROI on VSAT-1 was achieved because the company dramatically increased 


ARPU through selling commoditized products. As competitive intensity increases, 


charging installation fees equivalent to 3 months of service, requiring 2-year contracts, 


and charging extra for modems and customer service is not sustainable.  


 The project ROI on ViaSat-2, pegged conservatively by some on the Street at 16% does 


not include all associated ground network expenses – a figure estimated at $75-$100m 


by a satellite expert we spoke with and verified as missing from the $600-$650m in 


capex by individuals familiar with the project. 


 Satellite development costs are unlikely to ease. While management has stated the 


reason to take more operations in-house was done to preserve IP security, another 


primary goal was to quicken the payload development cycle down to just 12-18 months.
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 7 





This elevates capex for longer and increases the risk the company will develop capacity 


without accurately assessing market conditions. 





Investors are cash funding increasing technology risk. ViaSat has never generated free 


cash flow and will require constant access to the debt and equity markets to fund $1.4bn in cash 


burn needs over the next four years.  


 The most recent $500m equity round priced at $69, close to current trading levels, 


conveniently after reporting then-record high ARPU growth and despite the CFO stating 


the company’s leverage position was “very low” just 9 months prior.6 


 We estimate leverage of 4.0x by the end of 2020 (assuming cash burn is funded solely 


from future HY bond taps – historically the mix has been 50/50 debt/equity).  


 ViaSat is burning hundreds of millions of dollars of cash annually, without any 


demonstrated ROIC, trying to achieve an undefined level of scale, all amid 


unprecedented technological change.  





International Expansion Will Require Substantial Investment and Partnerships. ViaSat at 


its core is an engineering company; when it comes to selling the capacity, it suffers significant 


disadvantages.    


 U.S. retail capability was gained through the acquisition of WildBlue. As per multiple 


industry sources, ViaSat has no experience with retail operations in Europe. The 


company possesses even less in terms of infrastructure, experience, and partnerships 


everywhere else. This lack of global operational experience is in stark contrast to their 


ambitions of global satellite coverage.  


 The lack of global presence has led the company to sign a poorly structured, 


unfavorable agreement to gain a foothold in Europe.

II. Situation Overview 
 


Capitalization and Summary Financials 
 





Source:  Company filings, Kerrisdale estimates.  


1.  Net Debt Adj. for Cash Burn reflects Kerrisdale estimates of additional financing required to meet projected cash burn through

The level of interest aviation broadband generates among investors is out-sized relative to the 


business unit’s contribution to total revenue (only 4%). Residential broadband is a far more 


important driver for the company and represents the second largest contributor to revenue and 


an estimated 70% of reported EBITDA. 70-80% of the capacity on the company’s upcoming 


satellites is devoted to residential broadband. Though the company’s disclosures have grown 


murkier over time, the business unit is driven by the same building blocks of any telecom model:  


ARPU, gross subscriber additions, and churn (the level of disconnections as expressed as a 


monthly average percentage of the subscriber base). Faulty assumptions and poor disclosures 


have led all three to be modeled far too optimistically.

ARPU Will Decline 





Ever-increasing ARPU is embedded in Street forecasts and bullish investor expectations. 


Without the benefit of granular disclosure into what comprises ARPU, the Street has simply 


taken the company at its word in believing the metric’s remarkable increase over the past two 


years is sustainable. But what exactly is now in ARPU and why should investors be concerned? 


 
“ARPU is growing as a result of strength in our retail distribution, which accounts 


for a growing proportion of the subscriber base; higher-value, higher bandwidth 


service plans; and especially more recently, the introduction of value-added 


subscription features that aren't bandwidth dependent.” [emphasis added] 


 
— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, November 8, 2016) 


 
A criticism often levied at the company is that ViaSat-1 came up well short of original subscriber 
estimates. The satellite reached capacity constraints at under 700k subscribers less than 3 
years post-launch, rather than over 1m subscribers as originally guided by the company. The 
criticism is valid but rings hollow among bulls, partly because while the company did indeed fail 
to achieve targeted subscriber volumes, they were able to make up the revenue shortfall by 
increasing ARPU (i.e., they traded volume for price). Some bulls cite this trade-off as a strength 
of the company. It’s a clever piece of revisionist spin without understanding the true implications 
of what is now embedded in ARPU, and how it has serious implications going forward.  
 


Historical Subscriber Performance and ARPU Growth 
 


 
Source:  Company data, Kerrisdale estiamtes. 





In the summer of 2014, after several quarters of rapidly falling gross and net subscriber 


additions, ViaSat had to pivot. The company had not properly anticipated the level of data 


demand per subscriber and customers were fleeing because they had paid for what they

thought was terrestrial-like internet service, but instead found themselves running into onerous 


data caps and overages. Monthly churn was just shy of 3%, a horrendous level of performance. 


It implies turning over the company’s entire subscriber base every three years. To stop the 


bleeding, the company had no choice but to double the data caps without raising price. Below 


are screenshots from when the change took place:

The move paid off and stabilized subscriber trends at levels that continue to this day – but it 
created a new problem. The large increase in data allocated to each subscriber left the satellite 
without meaningful additional capacity. So how does a satellite broadband company grow 
revenue and achieve a targeted ROI without any actual broadband to sell? Unlike a terrestrial 
provider of bandwidth, ViaSat’s inventory is finite – it is the fundamental flaw in the business 
model versus terrestrial.  
  
Indeed, in the satellite internet business there’s pressure to maximize returns in initial years post 
launch because economic yields degrade over time. Capacity is finite, yet each household uses 
more bandwidth year after year. The satellite therefore reaches a point where there is no way to 
continue to deliver the same amount of speed to each customer. So speeds slow down, pricing 
power declines, subscriber levels begin to erode – therefore, the economic yield of a satellite 
declines. In trying to serve burgeoning consumer broadband demand, ViaSat has witnessed the 
point when yields decline occur earlier and earlier in the useable lifetime of a satellite. Thus, as 
the CEO once explained, “you got to make your money upfront.”7 
 
So, picture the board room of this supposedly innovative hybrid between Silicon Valley and the 
satellite industry trying to figure out how to demonstrate a viable business model in order to 
raise more cash for future satellites, when they are out of inventory after only 2.5 years. The 
answer: time-tested telecom bill-padding. Get customers to pay $29.99/mo. for VoIP, a low-
bandwidth voice application which rides over the internet connection. Remember that VoIP is 
provided for free by Google and for much lower prices than ViaSat by other providers. Charge 
$5.99 per month to have service restored and the right to speak to a customer representative in 
a timely manner (imagine how predatory that really is for a customer with limited options and a 
service that experiences periodic outages related to weather).

All telecom and cable operators collect fees and charge for add-ons, but embedded in ARPU for 
ViaSat is a significant amount of over-charging for products that are unsustainable as it tries to 
move upmarket. In the expanded addressable market ViaSat wishes to penetrate, there is 
plenty of competition and those operators will give away or heavily discount all of these 
services.  
 
We asked a veteran telecom consultant familiar with carrier billing practices about the level of 
fees and his shocked reply was, “So exactly how much are they able to charge for internet 
service?”  Good question – the company has never quantified the non-bandwidth contribution to 
ARPU; they’ve simply acknowledged it has increased materially.  
 
We spoke to a wholesaler of ViaSat services to gauge what the contribution of VoIP and other 
ancillary fees might be for the company. He described a sophisticated program the company 
uses to screen customers. In the areas where capacity still exists, the company targets premium 
customers with an estimated high receptivity to non-bandwidth add-ons and willingness to pay a 
higher installation fee. That is a good way to increase ARPU, but it is not a successful mass-
market strategy. According to the wholesaler, 30-35% of his rural customers take a VoIP 
bundle. The wholesaler’s company sells VoIP for $19/mo. as an add-on. When told ViaSat 
charges $29.99/mo., his response was “Yeah, they print money on VoIP.”  The market for VoIP 
and wired voice in general is in well-documented secular decline. The majority of all U.S.

households no longer have a landline voice connection due to wireless substitution.8  Charging 
$29.99/mo. for VoIP is over-earning on a dying low-bandwidth product.    
 
Based on the wholesaler’s comments, we conservatively assumed a 25% take rate for ViaSat 
VoIP and lay out our estimate of what currently comprises ARPU.  





The significance of these fees and add-ons should not be overlooked. The diminishing ability to 


charge extra for these services will eventually result in lower overall ARPU and margin attrition 


as highly profitable extras are included in basic access.  





This kind of ARPU erosion has taken place in the telecom industry for 30 years. Carriers charge 


early adopters for high-margin “convenience-oriented” features – voicemail, call-waiting, and 


email – that then erode under competitive pressure. In fact, it’s happened to ViaSat before, 


although one had to be paying close attention to notice. The only time in the last 16 quarters 


that ARPU declined slightly quarter-over-quarter (F3Q 2015), the company offered the following 


explanation: 





“The lower left chart shows blended consumer ARPU on a year-over-year and 


quarter-over-quarter basis. The decline in the non-recurring revenue component 


in this quarter led to total consumer ARPU being sequentially essentially flat.”

Non-recurring revenue is telecom code for activation charges, installation fees, and other one-
time add-on fees. After reviewing the disclaimers from the time, we found the company lowered 
the installation fee from $149.99 in F2Q15 to $99.99 in F3Q15.

It won’t take long to see how ARPU erosion will play out because ViaSat is already reacting to 
competition in the manner we are predicting. The company recently slashed prices on their 
highest plan by -33% while increasing data to match EchoStar’s newest plans (see HughesNet 
pricing plans below). Sure enough, EchoStar is including installation and a modem with built-in 
Wi-Fi in their plans.  
 
Despite all their talk of expanding the addressable market and taking share from terrestrial, the 
largest block of ViaSat’s customer acquisitions typically comes from trading subscribers back 
and forth with EchoStar’s HughesNet. Using its recently launched advanced satellite, EchoStar 
is aggressively marketing plans that mimic what ViaSat aims to offer nine months from now 
(assuming ViaSat-2 is operational by the end of 1Q18).

Consensus estimates call for ARPU continuing to increase +2-9% off of these unsustainable 
levels. It’s a forecast at odds with reality that is enabled by the company’s lack of disclosure. 
ViaSat will not have additional capacity for nine months and they’re confronting aggressive 
competition from EchoStar this second. The practices that helped grow ARPU to current levels 
only work when narrowing the target market to “premium” customers, not when trying to 
broaden addressability. Overcharging for non-core services is unsustainable and forecasts need 
to account for the inevitability that ARPU will decline.  
 
 
New Satellites are Losing Ground to the Competition 
 


“We feel if we can raise our speeds as fast or faster than other technologies, we 


feel like we have an enduring market.” 


 
— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, November 29, 2012) 


 
Held at the end of ViaSat-1’s first year in service, the 2012 ViaSat Analyst Day emphasized 
many of the competitive advantages enjoyed by the company at that time. CEO Mark Dankberg 
highlighted the “speed/value” advantage of ViaSat’s Exede-branded offering vs. competing 
technologies. The metric used to describe this advantage is a tortured one. “$ per Mbps per 
Month” is effectively the monthly bill divided into the speed delivered. It’s conceptually flawed 
because subscribers don’t just pay for the speed of data, they pay for an amount of it as well. 
ViaSat customers in 2012 only received a fraction of their typical desired capacity. But 
management didn’t want to draw attention to the onerous data caps of a measly 10GBs on the 
Analyst Day, and so the discussion around competition focused on one thing: speed.  
 


That said, in 2012 $50 a month for 12Mbps download speed ($4.17/Mbps/mo.) was an 


attractive, differentiated, speed/value proposition versus all of the alternatives (except fiber). It 


was orders of magnitude better than DSL and wireless. Speed, rather than capacity, formed the 


crux of ViaSat’s go-to-market strategy. Below, examine the screen capture of ViaSat’s main 


Exede-banded service from November 2012. Notice something missing?  There wasn’t a single 


mention of a data cap in their deceptive marketing for the first year of ViaSat-1. Emphasizing 


speed is what helped generate a large ramp in subscriber gross additions.

Below is a reproduction of data from a chart from the company’s 2012 Analyst Day that 
described its competitive speed/value advantage. We’ve inverted the depiction to show Mbps 
per $ per month for ease of comparison. ViaSat delivered significantly more speed per $ than its 
main terrestrial competitors. 
 


 
Now review the chart of the competitive landscape that will confront ViaSat-2 in early 2018. 
ViaSat-1’s sizable previous speed/value advantage against its main competitors – DSL, Cable, 
and wireless – has evaporated.  
 


2018 Competitive Landscape for ViaSat-2 





Source:  Kerrisdale estimates. ViaSat-2 conservatively assumes 50Mbps for $75 per month. Based on conversations 
with industry experts, this is likely better than the initial offer based on the estimated rated capacity of the satellite. 
Wireless assumes widely available 25Mbps LTE download speed at $70 per month. DSL assumes 25Mbps for $40 per 
month, Cable assumes 100Mbps for $60 per month.

As alluded to previously, evaluating broadband competition on speed alone is incomplete; one 
must factor in data consumption. In 2012, ViaSat sold plans in tiers of 7.5GB/15GB/25GB of 
data per month (if you read the fine print). This was at a time when average US household 
consumption was roughly 45GB per month.9 ViaSat’s current mid-tier offering is 25GB per 
month. ViaSat will increase data caps meaningfully with ViaSat-2 but even assuming that 
provisioning on a per subscriber basis triples, it still leaves them woefully uncompetitive.  
 
Based on data from Cisco and echoed by DSLReports, average U.S. household broadband 
consumption is currently a staggering 190GB per month. Terrestrial operators meet this demand 
with ease. If ViaSat tries to compete with terrestrial and increase the capacity provided to each 
customer, then the increased amount of gigabytes per month of data consumption will result in 
accommodating fewer people per satellite. It’s the same set of circumstances that led to 
downward revisions to subscriber forecasts for ViaSat-1.  
 
The company has claimed “virtually unlimited” data will be available with ViaSat-2.10  Once 
again, it’s important to read the fine print. Nothing is ever unlimited on a satellite. What “virtually 
unlimited” really means is the company will provision and sell data at a level they anticipate a 
typical consumer will not exceed (their track record is not stellar in that regard), and that unlike 
with ViaSat-1, they will no longer cut off customers once they hit their monthly allowance. ViaSat 
will however throttle the customer to speeds that will make the internet exceedingly slow and 
encourage subscribers to use “unlimited” data when the company can provide it – like at 4am – 
not when users may want it.  
 
A preview of these restrictions can be found in EchoStar’s newest offerings. EchoStar reduces 
speeds to 1-3 Mbps once the monthly plan data is reached (the highest of which is only 50GB, a 
quarter of current average consumption). ViaSat currently has plans that allow continued data 
usage beyond the monthly limit but throttled to 1-5 Mbps speeds until 5 p.m. From 5 p.m. to 2 
a.m., speeds drop “possibly below 1 Mbps.”   ViaSat warns customers that have an interest in 
using a lot of data in the evenings (i.e., nearly everyone who streams Netflix) that the plan “may 
not give you the best experience.” One can upgrade the amount of “priority data” before being 
hit with slower speeds but at a cost of roughly $10 per GB. 11   
 
So let’s assume one wanted to actually replicate a normal terrestrial experience with ViaSat-2 
technology and “virtually unlimited” price plans. Assuming a very generous $100 for 100 GB (it 
will probably be half that) still leaves the customer dealing with throttled speeds midway through 
the month. The customer can now begin setting her alarm clock for 2:00 a.m. to catch up on 
House of Cards or she can pay $5 more per GB (assumes half of the current incremental cost) 
to lift the restriction. Because she is still 90 GB short of what her household consumes per 
month, this would cost her an additional $450. Terrestrial providers don’t bother to advertise 
how much data your monthly bill includes – their customer base assumes data is unlimited. 
Even wireless customers have come to expect data should come without restrictive conditions.

“Virtually unlimited” from ViaSat is just the latest example of the games satellite providers play 
because of the limitations of their technology.  
 
Below we assume a more generous than likely improvement in data restrictions for ViaSat-2 
and the comparison still underscores how poorly positioned the company is when it comes to 
data capacity. Doubling or tripling speeds versus ViaSat-1 is immaterial when ViaSat-2 is still 
the only broadband technology that does not provide a level of data capacity that is in line with 
consumer habits.  
 


 
What about ViaSat-3 in 2020? It will be more of the same – the new constellation will continue 
to offer less than what consumers will demand, and trail terrestrial competitors. ViaSat-3 
represents a jump to 1 Tbps of capacity. Based on conversations with satellite experts and 
industry participants, ViaSat-3 will likely charge $75-$100 for standard speeds of 100Mbps and 
provision data at roughly 100-150GB per customer.12  In 2020, Cisco projects data consumption 
will be 278GB per household.  ViaSat will be selling the worst residential broadband solution 
money can buy. In the following charts we project the competitive positioning of ViaSat-1, 
ViaSat-2, and ViaSat-3 versus terrestrial.

ViaSat-2 Will Not Drive Meaningful Subscriber Growth 


 
The analyses above conservatively assume ViaSat delivers what they promise – something the 
company (and satellite broadband in general) does not do consistently. In the most recent FCC 
Measuring Broadband report, the commission found ViaSat to be the worst broadband provider 
in the nation when it comes to download speed as % of advertised. Even more concerning is the 
magnitude of year-over-year decline in observed median speeds. The latest FCC report found 
ViaSat’s median download speed was only 8.5Mbps in 2015, down -50% from 2 years prior.  
 
This decline in performance is due to a fundamental disadvantage of satellite technology in 
providing residential internet. In space, there are no inexpensive small cells, no new spectrum 
bands to deploy, no fiber or software upgrades. There is no way to meaningfully augment 
capacity to keep up with demand except to launch another satellite. Each individual satellite, 
therefore, always sees performance decline as subscribers are added to the satellite and more 
data is consumed by each subscriber.  
 
The more aggressive the subscriber forecast, the more severe the decline in speed will be for 
each subscriber. This is precisely why ViaSat subscribers who paid for 12 Mbps speed at 
launch began receiving only 8.5 Mbps 3 years later. Historically, terrestrial networks have also 
experienced declining performance as demand for bandwidth increases but according to 
industry sources, that no longer is a meaningful occurrence relative to prior times. Terrestrial 
operators have become proficient in adjusting network planning, investing in “hotspots” by 
upgrading software at the edge of the network, or using small cells – satellite technology can not 
take advantage of any of these paths to upgrading capacity.   


 2020 estimates:  ViaSat-2 assumes $.50 per GB based on $100 for 100 GB, DSL assumes $0.04 per GB based on $35 for 


1,000 GB, Cable assumes $0.03 per GB based on $70 for 2,000 GB, Fiber assumes $0.04 per GB based on $80 for 2,000 


GB, and Wireless assumes $.18 per GB based on $70 for 400 GB (unlimited fair use cap).

In formulating subscriber estimates for ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3, longs do not properly consider 


the inherent trade-off in performance that occurs as satellites fill up. It’s incorrect to assume that 


because ViaSat-1 and Wildblue have 700k subscribers, ViaSat-2 with double the capacity will 


be able to have 1.4m subscribers. Or that ViaSat-3 with 6x the capacity can have 4m 


subscribers. ViaSat-1 saw subscribers decline -2.4% sequentially last quarter, which translates 


to a subscriber decline of -10% annually. Its median speeds, as measured by the FCC’s 


Measuring Fixed Broadband reports, continue to materially decline. The median speeds of its 


terrestrial peers, in contrast, continue to materially increase.  





All of this means that ViaSat-2 is not providing capacity for new customers in more competitive 


markets – it’s providing just enough improvement in service to their existing customers so that 


these existing customers don’t switch at the first sight of a terrestrial alternative. ViaSat-2 is 


twice the capacity of ViaSat-1, which is precisely why it won’t drive significant subscriber growth 


because in the time it took ViaSat-2 to launch, the speed provided by primary competitors 


increased 20x and average data consumption increased 4x. Because consumer bandwidth 


demand continues to grow rapidly, and terrestrial alternatives have proven able to meet that 


demand growth and provide better and cheaper alternatives to satellites with each passing year, 


step-function increases in satellite capacity will continue to translate into relatively modest 


subscriber gains.  ViaSat-2 is not about growth, but simply a way for ViaSat to delay the death 


of its consumer home broadband business by a few more years.  





ViaSat could try to achieve subscriber growth by slashing price and offering a value service, but 
as we show later, ViaSat’s subscriber acquisition costs – let alone corporate and R&D expenses 
and capital investment requirements – are too high to make lower prices economic. Rather, 
ViaSat will likely do what we believe motivated the decision to bring all satellite R&D in-house:  
build a 2 Tbps ViaSat-4… then a 4 Tbps ViaSat-5… at 18-month intervals. If ViaSat tries to 
keep up with the competition, the company will remain on an unsustainable never-ending cash-

Reported EBITDA is Overstating Profitability While Investors Fund Increasing 


Technology Risk 





We are not the only ones who have serious concerns regarding ViaSat’s true profitability: 





“One of our concerns is that, while the company appears profitable (growing 


EBITDA), the growth has not been matched by profitability further down the P&L, 


or indeed in cash terms.” 





— Wilton Fry (RBC Capital Markets, January 25, 2017)   


 
Charts that describe impressive looking growth in EBITDA and cash flow from operations are a 


constant presence in quarterly earnings presentations. While technically accurate, neither of 


these metrics reliably depict the company’s true level of profitability or cash generation. For 


starters, investors must adjust the company’s reported EBITDA figure to account for significant 


amounts of equipment lease-derived revenue sources. But even more importantly, satellites 


cost money to build and have finite lives, so any true measure of profitability must account for 


the recurring nature of satellite capex in ViaSat’s business model.  





With respect to equipment lease revenue, a material amount of ViaSat’s revenue per customer 


within consumer broadband comes from installing and leasing customer premise equipment 


(CPE). CPE refers to hardware such as modems, routers, VoIP handsets, and satellite dishes. 


Precisely how much the company generates from leasing customer equipment rather than 


actual broadband services is unclear. Unlike telecom carrier peers, the company has delayed 


adoption of accounting standards and disclosure requirements (ASC 606) that would clearly 


delineate these sources of revenue and the impact that items such as installation fees have on 


reported ARPU.  


 
There are several concerning issues with the company’s non-bandwidth sources of revenue:   
 


1. The impact on reported EBITDA is highly distorted because equipment lease revenue is 
not offset by a commensurate level of expense. CPE expenses are not captured in cost 
of sales on the income statement. As per company filings, CPE costs are capitalized in 
investing activities on the cash flow statement. The only impact on the income statement 
is captured in depreciation expense. Therefore, what is captured in reported EBITDA is 
high levels of equipment lease revenue without an expense offset.    


2. ViaSat’s failure to adjust EBITDA for CPE expenses runs counter to industry best 
practices. When leases or installment plans undermine the validity of EBITDA as a proxy 
for cash profitability, telecom companies often provide disclosures so that the investment 
community can make an appropriate adjustment. Telecom analysts are aware that Sprint 
for example, has a large handset leasing program. Sprint discloses handset depreciation 
lease expense and this amount is then commonly deducted from reported EBITDA to 
form the basis of a lower “cash EBITDA” or “real EBITDA.”  To illustrate the point, here is 
an excerpt from a recent J.P. Morgan report on Sprint, “We model Sprint EBITDA of 
$11.04b in F2017…and $11.48bn in F2018…subtracting handset depreciation to get to a 
proxy for a “real” EBITDA number gets us to $7.26bn in F2017 and $7.77bn in F2018.

(emphasis added).”  Examine any detailed sell-side model for DISH and one will find 
EBITDA on a reported basis as well as EBITDA less an amount associated with 
capitalized CPE.  


3. ViaSat has withheld adequate disclosure of revenue sources as well as a host of other 
critical inputs needed to evaluate the health of the consumer broadband segment. 
ViaSat does not report gross adds, churn, subscriber acquisition costs, or retail service 
ARPU. Once adopted, new accounting standards will bring changes in revenue 
recognition and new guidelines for “collectability criteria” (i.e., churn), among a host of 
other reporting changes. How might ARPU change when an installation fee equivalent to 
3 months of a customer’s service plan is excluded?  How will Street models adapt to a 
true service ARPU that is materially lower than a figure distorted by non-bandwidth 
equipment charges?  How can one assess churn, a metric not even provided, when 
there is no meaningful disclosure regarding the terms by which a customer is deemed 
“uncollectible”?  For instance, unscrupulous telecoms in the past have chosen not to 
disconnect customers who’ve stopped paying their bills in order to reduce reported 
churn, and were able to do so because they were not held accountable to a standard for 
reporting customer departures / churn (just ask any Frontier investor if changes in 
customer churn policy can be material or not). These inputs are fundamental drivers of 
forecasts and their lack of disclosure represents significant risk the consumer segment is 
not properly modeled either on a historical or go-forward basis.  
 


We believe reported EBITDA should be adjusted for the impact of equipment lease revenue to 
derive “real EBITDA”.  After reviewing the company’s marketing plans, speaking with individuals 
familiar with product take-rates, and discussing our findings with an industry expert, we believe 
a conservative estimate of the ARPU associated with equipment leases alone is $15-$17 per 
month. This equates to over $120m in revenue on an annual basis. As of March 31, 2017, the 
company reported a total cost and accumulated depreciation of CPE units included in net PP&E 
of $272m. Assuming the midpoint of the company’s estimated useful life (4-5 years, which is 
above peers), annual CPE lease depreciation expense is roughly $60m. This translates to a -
$60m adjustment to reported EBITDA. Applied against reported FY17 EBITDA of $341m, this 
represents a reduction of -18% to arrive at a more representative $280m of “real” EBITDA.  
 
Not only is the level of distortion high, it is clearly rising – fueled by the company’s ongoing push 
to sell more commoditized equipment disguised as “value-added services.”  Take, for example, 
“Boost 25.”  The company provided a chart in a recent earnings presentation to highlight the 
service as a strength, but omitted any numbers on the Y-axis: 
 


Boosting EBITDA

The company has described Boost 25 as the single most popular value-added service. But what 
is Boost 25?  It sounds like the company is doubling bandwidth for that customer. As always 
with ViaSat, one needs to read the fine print. Boost 25 is really a $10 per month surcharge for a 
new modem. It’s another equipment lease. We don’t know how many Boost 25 subscribers 
there are – the entirety of the company’s disclosure on the subject is captured in the above 
chart. Based on how the company has described its popularity however, we are certain the 
product is contributing to an increasingly overstated level of EBITDA.  
 
Given the company’s capital-intensive satellite development activities and its eagerness to 
capitalize a significant percentage of its CPE expenses, it is hardly a surprise that depreciation 
and amortization is a very large expense. D&A expenses have grown rapidly, yet EBIT growth 
has been stagnant. ViaSat’s growing EBITDA has not meant growing free cash flow, and a large 
component of that EBITDA growth has come from ever-increasing D&A.    
 


 
We start with reported EBIT and then deduct the settlement payments received related to the 
Space Systems/Loral (SSL) patent infringement. From fiscal 2013 to fiscal 2016, EBIT from the 
company’s core operations increased by a total of $34m. Reported EBITDA however, (adjusted 
by the same SSL settlement) increased $119m. 71% of the increase in EBITDA was driven by 
adding-back higher levels of depreciation & amortization, which as just described, reflects 
capitalizing many of the costs needed to drive growth. This is perfectly acceptable GAAP 
accounting (for now) but it renders an unadjusted EBITDA figure completely unreliable from the 
perspective of trying to ascertain the company’s cash flow. 
 
The disconnect between the revenue ViaSat generates on the income statement and the true 
cost of those sales found on the cash flow statement is increasing. EBITDA will of course 
continue to increase if one doesn’t include the proper amount of costs incurred to actually 
generate revenue growth. The company is presenting to investors and analysts a manufactured 
and increasingly distorted EBITDA figure to prop up its valuation and hide the obvious flaws in 
its business model.  
 
What we believe is a reliable indication of the viability of the business model – or lack thereof – 
is the company’s consistent lack of free cash flow. Since 2012, ViaSat has issued $700m in high 
yield debt and $780m in equity to offset $1.1bn in cumulative cash burn. The most recent equity

round of $500m priced at $69/share will likely be exhausted within the next 18 months, requiring 
the company to return to the capital markets sometime in 2H 2017.  
 


 
We recognize that the company is in a period of investing for growth and don’t claim that the 
lack of FCF generation in and of itself is an indication of a low-quality business. A host of 
industries that do not generate FCF are rightfully judged to be fine businesses – MLPs, towers, 
fiber companies, et al. But these are businesses that do not carry the level of operational, 
technology, or competitive risk that ViaSat confronts in trying to provide consumer broadband 
from outer space to a shrinking addressable market. MLPs and towers have proven, long-lived 
assets that require minimal capital to augment. They do not have the significant risk of 
competitors regularly overbuilding a target market. ViaSat is caught trying to attain undefined 
scale, while requiring constant access to the markets, all amid unprecedented technological 
change. Investors are underwriting enormous risk which is not properly captured in the current 
stock price.  
 


Lack of Economic Returns 


 
Investors should ask themselves: can there really be a return on capital if replacement cycles 
are every 4 years?  Would cable be a good business if it had to build a new network every 4 
years to increase capacity? Cable technology standards and wireless 3G-4G-5G wireless cycles 
are roughly 8-10 years. If investors think cash will gush and returns will materialize once the 
pace of satellite launches slow, prepare to be disappointed. There is no end to this lack of 
returns within the investable horizon. The company has deliberately become more vertically 
integrated to build ever larger satellites at ever shorter intervals. The views of an individual 
familiar with ViaSat’s project development should concern those with DCFs where satellite costs 
and capex intensity decline meaningfully post ViaSat-3:

“I don’t see a break in the short term and Mark Dankberg doesn’t either. That’s 
really why he outfitted the Phoenix ViaSat team with a high bay where we can 
assemble, do final assembling, test – it’s large enough to work on 3 satellites all 
at once. So, certainly with ViaSat-3 and near-future ViaSat satellites, the plan is 
to compress the time between satellites. We talked about, you know, sort of like 
a year-and-a-half as a goal. That’s still a goal, I don’t think we’ll see that with 
ViaSat-3…but that’s kind of the goal they’re shooting at – have a payload ready 
every year to year and a half…  
 
You can have Boeing continue to assemble these payloads but, just the delay in 
communication between ViaSat folks and Boeing folks – you know, if you just 
eliminate that entire layer of communication in-house, you can turn around things 
much faster. That was one of the primary aspects – not only to protect intellectual 
property which was what Mark was primarily selling why we were doing things 
internal. But the other goal was to speed up the rate of turning out satellite 
payloads. I think you know, after suing Loral, I think any company that would get 
ViaSat business would be hyper-aware that ViaSat isn’t afraid to take you to 
court if you’re gonna give away the satellite secrets. So, that’s a good excuse for 
bringing it in house but that’s sort of like a red herring, it’s not really the real 
reason – the real reason is to speed things up in terms of turning out payloads.”  


 
Longs try and point to individual project IRRs to overcome the fact that corporate-level ROICs 
are non-existent. Recall however what really happened with ViaSat-1. IRRs for the satellite were 
achieved (allegedly) because of a pivot toward over-charging for non-bandwidth services in the 
wake of the company having an insufficient amount of data to provide to its customers. ViaSat-2 
will once again fall short of providing customers with enough data, but the circumstances that 
helped ARPU rise in the past cannot be duplicated. 
 
A mix shift to selling services directly to subscribers (retail) versus a wholesale model used by 
legacy WildBlue helped ARPU rise ~7-10% in the initial years post launch. When ViaSat first 
acquired WildBlue in 2009, wholesale distribution through DISH Network and NRTC (National 
Rural Telecommunications Cooperative) was WildBlue’s main sales channel. In 2011, EchoStar 
bought Hughes and in short order, DISH switched almost all satellite broadband sales to 
Hughes. By 2014, NRTC’s constituents ranked satellite internet infrastructure the area of 
development least worthy of focus:

As a result, ViaSat subscriber growth over the last several years has been driven by direct retail 
sales. ViaSat owns the customer relationship, incurs all the acquisition costs, and captures a 
much higher ARPU, including equipment leases. We estimate retail ARPU is ~$73 (we have to 
estimate because the company does not disclose retail versus wholesale ARPU). Based on 
numerous industry conversations, wholesale ARPU is approximately 50% of retail, less the 
terminal lease, so roughly $27-$30. Thus, a required mix shift to a retail-heavy model had a 
pronounced effect on increasing ARPU up until 2015. The shift is no longer a key driver of 
ARPU growth because ViaSat’s subscriber activity has been predominantly retail-focused for 
years. Any pickup in the wholesale channel with the launch of ViaSat-2 would dampen ARPU. 
Over the past 2 years, ARPU has risen a further 18% by selling products that can’t be charged 
for in an increasingly competitive environment. The core drivers of historical ARPU growth 
cannot be relied upon going forward and that leaves the company without levers should 
subscriber growth disappoint. What’s plan B when ViaSat-2 hits capacity constraints after only 
modest subscriber growth?  Double the price of EasyCare?   
 
We provide our own take of ViaSat-2’s project IRR in Appendix I, but the truth is that the 
exercise is purely theoretical. There are no true discrete IRRs; a satellite is part of a network. 
When the company describes the IRR for their current workhorse satellite, ViaSat-1, they 
exclude the invested capital that went into acquiring WildBlue’s retail subscriber base and 
related infrastructure. The IRR therefore captures a scenario as if $600m was spent on a 
satellite that appeared in the southern sky ready to sell high-margin Boost 25 and EasyCare all 
by itself. Cable Wi-Fi and wireless will continue to plunder ViaSat’s addressable market and 
erode the unit economics of each subscriber. Project IRRs will continue to decline.

The Unserved Rural Market  





“We assume these 23m rural Americans comprise ~9m households (based on 


the Census Bureau’s estimate of 2.5 persons per household) and a total 


addressable market of ~$7 billion in revenue ($3 billion in EBITDA) – nearly 10x 


greater than our 2017 Satellite Services EBITDA estimate for ViaSat.”

“I found that if I wasn’t getting [ViaSat] for free because I was an employee, I 


would not continue the service myself. There were a lot of times when the service 


was down or interrupted by weather. So, from a terrestrial user perspective, if 


you’re in a remote area, and that’s really one of the few options, you kinda have 


to go with what you have. But if you’re a metro or larger area that is being 


serviced by cable companies or more reliable internet service providers I would 


find it difficult for someone to really choose the ViaSat service.”

Because satellite-based residential internet would appeal only to those with limited options, 


analysts focus on rural households when sizing the addressable market. The approach is flawed 


as ViaSat’s current customer distribution is not as rural as one would think – for one, it follows 


the general population density of the U.S. – and the company’s clearly stated objective is to 


move upmarket with ViaSat-2, not further penetrate rural areas.  





 
To appreciate the market challenges confronting ViaSat, investors need to focus on areas that 
are suburban and on the fringe of metro areas. Nevertheless, we address the rural competitive 
landscape here as well.  
 
When sizing the rural opportunity, many analysts (such as the one quoted at the start of this 
section) rely on the 2016 FCC Broadband Progress Report estimate of 23m Americans that lack 
access to 25/3 Mbps download/upload speed. While a reasonable starting point for sizing the 
addressable market, it fails as a proper estimate because it conflates broadband availability, 
which is driven primarily by infrastructure costs and population density, with broadband 
adoption. Adoption of broadband is a function of a host of socio-economic factors.  
 
In numerous Pew Research and academic studies over the years, the most prevalent answer 
for why individuals do not subscribe to an internet service has nothing at all to do with lacking 
access.13 The most commonly cited reason is cost. Other reasons cited more frequently than 
lack of availability include:  irrelevance to a respondent’s daily life, lack of having a computer, 
lack of knowing how to use a computer, and sufficient access outside the home (libraries, cafes, 
etc). Unless ViaSat intends to dramatically lower price, give away computers and provide 
computing lessons, the true addressable market is not anywhere close to 23m rural Americans.

The lack of appreciation for the rate at which availability is improving is another critical error in 


sizing the market opportunity. Citing a report from 2016 in a vacuum is to treat the market as 


static when, in fact, it is witnessing meaningful change every year. The US Government has 


budgeted close to $2bn a year in subsidies for improving rural broadband access.14 ViaSat is 


the only internet service provider without additional capacity – even smaller, low-end DSL and 


cable providers are accelerating the deployment of technologies that significantly enhance the 


capabilities of wired networks. A year in the accounting lifetime of a satellite may not be much 


but in the competitive internet service business, it is an eternity. Compare the 2016 FCC 


Progress Report to the 2015 edition – the total population figure of 34m who lacked 25/3Mbps 


represented a -40% decrease year-over-year. The lack of availability in urban areas was 


chopped by over half.  





Conservatively, assuming an easing in the annual decline rate to -20% for rural households and 


-30% for urban, we estimate the number of rural homes without wired 25 Mbps availability will 


decline to 5m by the end of 2018.  





An evaluation of the addressable market must also consider rates of actual home broadband 


adoption at various speeds. According to the FCC, in 2014, the overall adoption rate of 25/3 


Mbps service was 40% in Urban Core Areas and 33% in Non-Urban Core Areas. Assuming 


adoption rates rise to 70% in non-urban areas trims the number of rural homes that may adopt 


25 Mbps in 2018E to roughly 3.5m homes.

One final piece to the exercise is to recognize that not all homes are created equal. To receive 


satellite internet, one needs a roof able to accommodate a satellite dish (97% of installations are 


to a roof) with clear line of sight to the southern sky.  That’s a meaningful requirement as 


according to the Housing Assistance Council, 30% of rural Americans live in substandard 


housing with leaky roofs or inadequate plumbing.15  It’s also significantly harder to consider 


installing a satellite dish when you don’t own your property, or live in an apartment complex, or 


live in a mobile home. 14% of rural homes are mounted on wheels. Reviewing housing data 


from the Housing Data Council indicates that conservatively, 15-20% of rural and urban homes 


are structurally unlikely to be ever served by satellite – even if ViaSat was giving it away for free. 


This lowers the addressable market of unserved rural homes to roughly 3m – a figure in line 


with and confirmed by an industry expert.

Bulls focus on the company having just 700k customers as a sign of low penetration. But one of 
the defining qualities of ViaSat’s subscriber base is its high rate of monthly churn (2.5-3%). It’s 
equivalent to ViaSat turning over its entire subscriber base every three years. To retain the 659k 
net customers it currently has, ViaSat had to burn through 1.2m gross customer additions over 
the past 5 years. We estimate EchoStar, a direct competitor to ViaSat, has recorded roughly 2m 
in gross adds to achieve its current 1.2m subscriber base. As a result, over 3m people in the 
last 5 years have been tainted by satellite’s degraded speed, spotty reliability and constraining 
usage caps.

sub ~5-7Mbps download speeds in September 2015. If the analysis were updated today that 


figure has already declined by half. It’s a trend consistent with the previously detailed -40% 


year-over-year decline in homes that lacked 25/3Mbps fixed line access. Assuming current 


levels of 20Mbps availability among the major DSL carriers continues to improve in a manner 


consistent with broader market trends, the number of DSL subscribers lacking access to 20 


Mbps declines to roughly 5m by the end of next year.  





Some bulls may still believe the company can take share among the dwindling last few million 


truly rural and/or slow-DSL homes that would find ViaSat speeds attractive. While ViaSat does 


have a compelling speed offering to go after this potential pool of customers, it’s important to 


remember many of these customers are paying 30-40% below the lowest plans offered by 


ViaSat. Price is a vital determinant of subscriber addressability. A former VP of Marketing at a 


cable company explains: 


 
“The reason we lose customers to DSL is, we may be $49 for 60Mbps and theirs 
is $39 for 3Mbps – and we’ll lose because they put zero value in speed above 
3Mbps… there’s a certain group of customers that DSL has hung onto the 
longest that don’t value speed.”

Not only is DSL considerably cheaper on a monthly access basis, things like customer service, 


anti-virus, and a Wi-Fi router come standard and subscription plans don’t require a 2-year 


contract. This is not a customer base that prioritizes higher speeds let alone paying for costly 


add-ons. Below are current terms offered by a large DSL provider, CenturyLink. ViaSat’s current 


subscriber base predominantly receives 12 Mbps download speed and the lowest priced tier is 


2.5x more expensive than what CenturyLink has available in all 50 states. 













































































 
Of ViaSat’s 659k customers, ~400k migrated as part of the company’s acquisition of WildBlue. 
WildBlue customers wanted the benefit of dramatically better speeds provided by the new 
satellite. ViaSat-1 represented a 10x improvement in service plans versus WildBlue. ViaSat has 
stated they believe migrations when ViaSat-2 is launched will be “less pronounced than in the

past.” The company is downplaying this potential impact under the guise of saying ViaSat-2 is 
not as significant an improvement over ViaSat-1 as ViaSat-1 was to WildBlue.  However, given 
the vastly improved competitive offerings available to a ViaSat customer now compared to when 
ViaSat-1 was launched, a customer that ViaSat does not proactively migrate is now far more 
susceptible to switching to more attractively priced DSL at the same exact speed and without 
any data caps. Furthermore, we suspect ViaSat downplays the potential impact of migrations 
because it knows the impact to margins would be negative. To facilitate a subscriber who 
wishes to move from ViaSat-1 service to ViaSat-2, the company will have to do a “truck roll.”  
This means the company will have to visit the customer premise of the subscriber and perform 
some combination of replacing old equipment and re-positioning the satellite dish to pick up the 
signal from the new satellite. That endeavor is costly. To recover the costs of the labor and 
equipment associated with the upgrade, ViaSat will have to charge the customer a fee of 
several hundred dollars. With the competitive alternatives available to that customer, this 
potential migrating subscriber will have leverage against paying that fee and many of the 
additional charges that have become embedded in ARPU. ViaSat will either have to absorb the 
cost of the migration or allow the subscriber to churn. Once again, to downplay the true 
competitive positioning of the consumer business, Dankberg has focused on the capabilities of 
ViaSat-2 in comparison to ViaSat-1 instead of the more relevant comparison: ViaSat-2 
compared to terrestrial.  
 
Despite all the talk about the opportunity to target DSL subscribers, ViaSat’s track record in 
getting DSL customers to switch has never been impressive. In a slide from their 2012 Analyst 
Day (and echoed in subsequent communications with regulators and investors), the company 
indicated 13% of their new customers came from DSL. Dankberg confusingly referenced this 
figure as a sign of success against terrestrial. It’s a misleading characterization. In 2012, DSL 
was a poorly positioned internet service and quickly losing its dominant 60% broadband market 
share to cable. That only 13% of new ViaSat customers came from DSL is not an achievement 
worth bragging about – it’s a sign of poor execution against the market incumbent with an 
inferior offering. Satellite was and still is an insignificant part of the residential broadband 
market. One must squint to see satellite’s contribution to the broadband market on a pie chart. 
And yet, 37% of ViaSat’s incoming customers came from the only other satellite internet 
provider, EchoStar. We asked a former satellite TV executive about this and his view was 37% 
may actually understate the level of switching because the statistic is dependent on customer 
self-reporting. Customers who switch back and forth in order to “game” promotions may choose 
not to disclose that they are a prior satellite internet customer.  
 
The truth is when it comes to competing against DSL, ViaSat added far fewer subscribers than 
the considerable technology and coverage advantages they used to enjoy 5 years ago would 
suggest. The company was far more successful simply trading satellite customers who had no 
alternative back and forth with EchoStar. Today, DSL, cable, and wireless have all significantly 
improved their speed/capacity/value proposition versus the last time ViaSat had new capacity. 
There is far less that sets ViaSat-2 apart from the competition than when ViaSat-1 entered the 
market.  Nothing about 25Mbps–75Mbps, data restrictions, extra charges for customer service, 
$149.99 installation fees, and mid-tier plans that start at $75 constitutes what a DSL customer is 
typically looking for: good value.

ViaSat Doesn’t Do Particularly Well Against DSL

It’s worth mentioning that the company’s current subscriber acquisition costs (SAC) and churn 


profile do not allow for generating incremental value at DSL-like price points. Below we provide 


a basic customer lifetime value analysis at a $28 retail ARPU. The analysis conservatively does 


not assign capex on an incremental basis and assumes $650 in SAC. We have generously 


assumed only 2.20% churn for this low-end customer. The company simply does not generate a 


decent NPV on an incremental subscriber basis at discounted price points. 


 
The primary reason Street and company expectations for ViaSat-2 peak gross additions are set 
at ~100-110k per quarter is because a comparable level of performance was achieved by 
ViaSat-1. But ViaSat-2 is entering a vastly different competitive landscape than ViaSat-1.

Remember what the broadband market looked like in 2012: 48.3m Americans (~19m homes) 
lacked access to a speed (6 Mbps) that was half of ViaSat’s base offering. Even with 
adjustments for rates of adoption and housing, the addressable market was significantly larger 
and less competitive than what will confront ViaSat-2. DSL was a 1Mbps service that charged 
$35 a month. Wireless as a possible home broadband solution was not even part of the 
conversation. ViaSat had technology that made sense at $50 for 12Mbps. Data caps were a 
problem but also poorly understood – a phenomenon the company has admitted resulted in the 
service being sold to people who were not a fit.  There was no other satellite provider that 
offered a similar level of performance. With all that, the company attracted 319k in gross adds in 
their peak year. The list of factors that were once in their favor have now all swung against 
them. ViaSat is not trying to move upmarket in residential broadband because they have an 
improving technology advantage; rather, the company is investing in expensive new satellites to 
retain existing customers in an attempt to outrun the shrinking number of Americans that would 
ever choose to receive the internet from outer space. But this truth is not a story the company 
can sell investors.  
 
 
Churn Expectations Bear No Resemblance to Historical Trends and Competitive Reality 
 


Avg. Quarterly Gross Adds vs. Churn

Red Stars represent Street estimates for the average quarterly gross adds for FY19E and monthly churn.  





 
The correlation between gross adds and churn is common across telecom providers, not just 
ViaSat. Often, when a company takes measures to boost adds, higher churn follows. Even 
when ViaSat did provide a differentiated level of speed/value, they failed to keep churn in check 
as gross subscriber additions increased (see the correlation among the blue diamonds in the 
above chart). When companies try to aggressively grow customer additions, they increase 
marketing, offer promotions/discounts, loosen credit standards, and, in the case of ViaSat, gloss 
over details like data caps. Catching customers like this (gross adds) is the easy part, keeping 
them (churn) is the challenge. With ViaSat, churn only fell after capacity limits on ViaSat-1 were 
met and the company stopped trying to add new customers.

Current Street estimates reflect unreal expectations set by the company and enabled by a lack 
of disclosure. Consensus forecasts call for a combination of gross adds returning to peak 
ViaSat-1 levels, when the company was aggressively trying to fill capacity – paired with a level 
of churn in line with the company’s recent operating performance which reflects a strategy of 
deliberately not trying to add new customers.  
 
ViaSat’s historical churn was particularly exacerbated by poor customer understanding of data 
caps. This is a structural challenge. As previously explained, ViaSat-2 will not offer much in the 
way of improved performance versus wired and wireless alternatives. There may not be a hard 
cap on data once ViaSat-2 is operational, but customers will be throttled to lower speeds well 
before many consume their desired monthly bandwidth. Thus, one of the primary sources of 
churn – the data caps – will still be a challenge. As the CEO once explained, there isn’t a lot that 
educating customers can really accomplish:   
 


“By far the biggest source of churn [is] people hitting the usage caps. Now, the 
usage caps are the way that we preserve the integrity of the speed. We try to be 
very up-front about ‘here is where they are and here is what they mean.’  But 
still a lot of people don’t understand them. I think that is just a fact of life. 
We’re not going to educate people.” [Emphasis added] 
 


— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, May 19, 2015) 
 
Furthermore, the company expects to increase gross adds and keep churn low while entering 
more competitive markets.  While more recently the company has guided to a rosier outlook for 
churn, a few years ago, further removed from ViaSat-2’s service date, the company held very 
different views: 
 


“We’d expect the churn rate for customers that are otherwise un-served to be 
lower than the churn rate for our customers that are in under-served category, 
which should be lower than customers who are classified as fully-served.”   
 


— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, May 16, 2013) 
 
ViaSat requires a minimum 2-year contract. Terrestrial competition often requires none (a 
Frontier Internet promotion states “Stay because you’re happy with our service, not because 
you have to.”)  The termination fee (captured in ARPU) is $270 if a customer is unsatisfied with 
service after 6 months. Policies like this suppress churn. The company can try to compete by 
removing contracts or lowering fees but these of course would result in higher churn and lower 
ARPU. 
 
 
International Opportunity Will Require Substantial Investment  
 
ViaSat-2 will bring increased terrestrial coverage to Central America, the Caribbean, and the 
northern fringe of South America. The 2nd ViaSat-3 class satellite will provide coverage over 
Europe and the Middle East. Bulls often cite attractive opportunities to reach underserved 
markets in these regions while ignoring the inherent costs and challenges. ViaSat has minimal 
resources outside the U.S. and will rely on partnerships and JVs to gain international access 
and defray investment costs. ViaSat is not negotiating from a position of strength and the 
lengths to which they may be required to go to secure distribution for ViaSat-3 class satellites 
internationally can be seen in their recently signed JV with Eutelsat.

In ViaSat’s bid to gain a foothold in Europe, they signed a deal regarded by many familiar with 
the company, industry observers and equity research analysts as convoluted and unfavorable. 
The JV agreement consists of two main entities:  Retail Services (51% owned by ViaSat) and 
Wholesale (Infrastructure) Services (51% owned by Eutelsat). A diagram of the agreement is 
provided below: 
 


ViaSat/Eutelsat JV 
 





Source:  Kerrisdale research, Eutelsat May 2017 and March 2015 investor presentations, Eutelsat and ViaSat press 


releases. 





 
In exchange for €132.5m, ViaSat acquired 49% of a wholesale satellite capacity entity whose 
primary asset is Eutelsat’s 6-year-old satellite, KA-SAT. ViaSat also now owns 51% of the retail 
broadband business served by KA-SAT, a unit with 190k customers, primarily in Western 
Europe. It is expected that the second ViaSat-3 satellite, aimed at Europe and the Middle East, 
will eventually serve as additional capacity for the wholesale business although terms of that 
part of the agreement are still being finalized. Eutelsat’s retail business operates under the 
Tooway brand, and offers a range of plans similar in nature to ViaSat’s operations in the U.S. 
though at sharply lower ARPUs of ~$30-35. After 6 years, subscriber levels have stalled at 
~190k despite an addressable market of 4m-14m households.16 Based on Eutelsat comments 
and industry checks, the retail business is currently capacity constrained in most western 
European markets. Most unsold capacity is currently in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean 
where ARPU is even lower.    
 
So, in sum, in exchange for €132.5m, ViaSat now owns 51% of a retail business that is not 
growing and 49% of a 6-year-old satellite that delivers 8 Mbps download speed and is capacity

constrained in most markets outside of Eastern Europe. Eutelsat can apply that €132.5m 
($148m) toward purchasing 50% of the second ViaSat-3 satellite and will own 51% of the 
economics of the wholesale entity to which it will be contributed. The total cost of a ViaSat-3 
satellite is ~$650m. In selling 49% of KA-SAT, a 90 Gbps satellite past its prime useful life, 
Eutelsat in effect received a massive discount toward half of a state-of-the-art 1 Tbps satellite. 
The remaining outlay may only be ~$170m ($325m, half of ViaSat-3’s total cost, less $148m 
that Eutelsat just received from selling KA-SAT). It’s a terrific deal for Eutelsat. 
 
What does ViaSat gain by all this? Access to Europe (particularly Eastern Europe it would 
appear) where they hope to learn about the market and improve upon Eutelsat’s flagging 
operations. The company does gain capacity on KA-SAT for aeronautical, a noteworthy win. But 
it’s all a very steep price to pay for what is ultimately market access and distribution. We asked 
someone familiar with ViaSat’s Eutelsat relationship his thoughts on the JV. He was surprised a 
deal was ever signed. He confirmed that ViaSat doesn’t know anything about retail operations in 
Europe. He thought that the idea that ViaSat could help Eutelsat with retail made little sense 
because “you need Europeans to sell.”   
 
A key takeaway is that ViaSat simply lacks critical infrastructure, relationships, investments, and 
experience outside the U.S. to effectively distribute capacity in foreign markets. ViaSat will have 
to rely on JVs and partnerships with large, incumbent satellite and telecom operators in markets 
in which it is unfamiliar – that is not a recipe for improving the company’s nonexistent returns. 
Management has stated that Europe is the 2nd best market outside of the U.S – one should 
expect the costs and challenges become only further magnified in Central America and Africa.

III. Technology is Fueling Capacity Gains Faster than Satellite 


Can Match 
 


“Our research together with compelling market data clearly indicates the 
cumulative impact of accelerated 4/5G mobile broadband deployment, nearly 400 
MHz of incremental spectrum across 5 bands, performance gains from carrier 
aggregation, massive advances in copper technology, newly-developed wireless 
backhaul capabilities combined with network infrastructure virtualization, and the 
cost efficiencies of industry consolidation, all point to a seemingly insurmountable 
competitive threat for legacy satellite providers.” 
 


— Bill Stueber (Managing Partner of Wireless Assets, May 16, 2013) 
 
 “What are our competitors going to do?  They’ve got to dig trenches, they’ve got 
to string wires if they’re wireless, there’s not a whole lot more spectrum, they’ve 
got to have way more towers...And we look at LTE or LTE advanced, given that 
there's not an enormous amount of more spectrum coming, the big metric is bits 
per second per hertz of spectrum, how much is that changing. Well it goes up by 
30% in the next 4 or 5 years. We can deal with that.” 
 


— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, November 29, 2012) 
 
 
LTE is Disrupting the Competitive Landscape 


 
Dankberg’s comments from 2012 proved to be a myopic assessment of the evolution of the 
broadband environment. A wide variety of technological innovations in the wireless world, 
including the proliferation of LTE, small cell technology, carrier aggregation and advanced 
MIMO techniques, have worked in concert to dramatically increase spectral efficiency, capacity, 
speeds and geographic distribution. The level of innovation across both wireless and wired 
networks has advanced such that satellite has no way of taking share while its historical rural 
market advantage, predicated on prohibitive infrastructure costs for competitors, is 
disappearing. 
 
This obsolescence risk is downplayed by the company and not captured in the trading value of 
shares. In 2015, Dankberg said he would create separation from LTE overlays. We believe he 
was correct, but not in the way his comment was intended. The separation is created by LTE 
leaving satellite behind.  
 
5 years ago, wireless was 10x slower and 6x less cost effective on a $ per GB consumed basis 
than satellite. With unlimited 4G LTE, wireless now delivers satellite equivalent speeds at a 
significant discount per GB consumed. 99.7% of the U.S. population has access to 4G LTE.17 
By 2020, wireless capacity will align with projected household demand, while satellite will be 
saddled with data limitations that cannot be resolved.

5G Technology is Incremental Threat 


 
One of the biggest misconceptions regarding the myriad of technological threats confronting 
ViaSat is the timing and nature of 5G. There is a tendency within the investment community to 
treat 5G as purely a technology standards setting process that will not be finalized until 2020. 
That is a reductive and inaccurate view. 5G represents the continued evolution of a core set of 
LTE building blocks which are transforming wireless technology right now.  
 
In many LTE markets across the country, wireless carriers have already achieved speeds 
greater than 25 Mbps, a 40-100% increase in just the past 6 months. Each of the 4 major mobile 
carriers is engaged in making 5G a reality well before formal “final” standards approval in 2020. 
AT&T will launch 1Gbps 5G trials in 20 metro areas while Verizon has already announced 11 – 
all before ViaSat-2 is operational. T-Mobile has made a commitment to offer nationwide mobile 
5G by the end of 2020. Sprint’s aggregation of 800 MHz, PCS and 2.5 GHz is a functional 
equivalent. 
 
Numerous component building blocks of 5G technologies are currently contributing to an 
exponential increase in spectral efficiency. The overall 5G standard performance benchmarks 
embedded into the target components of the final release include:   


• Spectral Efficiency increases up to 1,000x maximum   
(30 bits/Hz downlink and 15 bits/Hz uplink) 


• 4 ms latency (1 ms for Ultra Reliable devices) 
• Minimum real-world device network speeds of 100/50 Mbps  
• 1M user density for square kilometer 
• 20/10 Gbps downlink data rate per base station 


Current LTE Speeds

• Aggregated spectrum blocks of 100 Mhz 
 
Based on estimates from proprietary research data provider Wireless Assets, even moderate 
advancement toward final 5G standards dramatically impairs ViaSat’s competitive position 
relative to incrementally compounding wireless network speed growth over the next 5 years 
(see below). This chart depicts the projected maximum observable LTE speed using 
conservative estimates for deployment of 5G technologies:   


 
LTE Home Broadband 
 
Wireless carriers have already begun to launch home broadband with LTE. For potential or prior 
satellite subscribers who previously lacked choice or were underserved by terrestrial wireline, 
wireless home broadband is more than a potential option. In many cases it’s faster and makes 
more economic sense. Verizon offers LTE home broadband devices (pictured below) as either a 
stand-alone offering or part of an existing subscriber unlimited data plan. Subscribers can 
purchase equipment for less than the average ViaSat’s installation fee.  
 
Verizon’s data caps are set at a high 200GB, essentially designed to restrict abuse and 
bandwidth hogs. In contrast, ViaSat’s restrictions limit regular subscribers from using basic 
services like Hulu or Netflix, including customers who ultimately switch to the new ViaSat-2 in 
2018. What’s more, advancements in 5G are taking place at such a rate that wireless home 
broadband is on a near-term path toward terrestrial, fiber-like capabilities while satellite 
continues to fall behind.  


Projected LTE Speeds

1. Projections for LTE network speeds are derived from an array of technological advancements present in current carrier 
deployments including: 1) Carrier Aggregation (CA) which currently allows a carrier to join up to 5 spectrum blocks 
together for an increased overall bandwidth pipe, 2) Advanced MIMO (Multiple In, Multiple Out) which boosts data speed 
by increasing the number connection paths between the cell site and subscriber device, and 3) 256QAM (Quadrature 
Amplitude Modulation) which improves the bit rate of transmission.

Metro Fiber Hub Build-Outs Enable Coverage & Capacity Gains Well Beyond Just 
Wireline 
 
An outdated belief among ViaSat bulls is that carrier fiber rollouts are isolated to dense metro 
areas and therefore pose a limited threat to ViaSat’s more traditional suburban target markets. 
This is decade-old thinking. Fiber is not a high-cost, low return investment anymore. De-
emphasized by landline carriers two and a half years ago, metro fiber rollouts have returned in 
full swing because fiber doesn’t simply provide capacity to homes and businesses along the 
fiber optic route itself – it’s part of a broader ecosystem.  
 
Fiber is an umbilical cord that fuels step-function improvement across every broadband delivery 
model in a market – wireless, cable, Wi-Fi, and copper. Fiber need not be connected to each 
individual household – instead, dense fiber hubs can be connected to co-location facilities and 
distribution points that then allow other delivery models to provide faster speeds as a result of 
being connected to the fiber hub. Copper technologies enhanced by fiber such as VDSL and 
G.fast produce dramatically better speeds as a result of fiber deployment. In townships of just 
25,000-30,000 and in the fringes of metro areas, G.fast can upgrade lines to 25 Mbps on a 
5,000ft loop length. In more densely populated areas, speeds up to 1GB are achievable. G.fast 
costs $100-$150 per sub line and is mostly modulation software installed into network end 
points. 250x increases in copper downlink capacity are achievable with only 50% of the 
technical standard for G.fast deployments according to research from Wireless Assets.

On the wireless side, outside the urban core where an individual carrier perhaps does not have 
robust spectrum resources, carriers are utilizing a combination of licensed, “lightly-licensed”, 
and unlicensed spectrum bands (“LAA” and “LTE-U” in the diagrams) to improve coverage and 
service. As mentioned above, these LTE solutions are increasingly being deployed for home 
broadband fixed wireless solutions. Fiber is a critical component in enabling the backhauling of 
traffic from these wireless nodes in an efficient, cost-effective manner.   
 
Cable companies, traditionally bound by high-cost last mile solutions, already own dense, 
hybrid-fiber networks and stand to benefit from Wi-Fi and unlicensed spectrum integration with 
LTE/LTE-U. This approach allows them to extend beyond just the wired portions of their network 
to encompass nearly everyone within their footprints at speeds greater than 25 Mbps and with 
modest incremental cost. The 125m potential subscribers that live within Comcast’s footprint, 


Evolution of Fiber Coverage in a Population Center 
 
Below we illustrate how fiber is deployed in a population center and enables significant, incremental 
broadband delivery beyond just the route itself. In the top left quadrant, metro fiber is first brought to 
the city through what is known as a metro fiber hub. Note, we have shown an actual city, Memphis 
(the blue is the Mississippi River). In the top right, fiber is then connected to co-location facilities for 
wireline (the red and and yellow blocks that denote DSL and cable) and wireless networks (blue 
blocks) that are closest to the metro fiber hub. In the bottom left, fiber is then distributed through the 
balance of existing legacy networks. Finally, in the bottom right, more remote distribution points 
(ViaSat’s existing and stated target markets) receive the benefit of much greater speed and wireless 
licensed and unlicensed networks become lit. For Memphis, this would take place in an estimated 6-
18 months.

Metro fiber rollouts have implications beyond the most dense or urban locales historically 
associated with the fiber deployment itself. Remember, ViaSat is not particularly rural and in the 
company’s own presentations to the FCC, states its customers “are everywhere.”  The suburban 
fringe and neighborhoods that lie just outside of the “belt” that rings metropolitan areas are 
precisely where the combination of fiber, Wi-Fi, and unlicensed spectrum is disrupting the entire

IV. Company Description 
 


 ViaSat is a satellite operator that provides advanced digital satellite telecommunications 


and wireless signal processing equipment to residential consumers, airlines and the 


defense industry.  


 The company operates through three reporting segments: Satellite Services, 


Commercial Networks, and Government Systems. 


 We have focused in this report on the Consumer Broadband sub-segment of Satellite 


Services, the 2nd largest contributor to revenue and ~70% of EBITDA.  Residential 


internet represents ~70%+ of the capacity for ViaSat-1 and future satellites.  


 
Background 
 


 The company was founded in 1986 by current CEO Mark Dankberg, Mark Miller and 
Steve Hart. ViaSat’s roots are as a defense-oriented satellite communications hardware 
manufacturer. In 2008, the company entered the satellite services market when it 
announced a contract with Space Systems/Loral to build ViaSat-1, a 140Gbps satellite. 
The original plan was to lease ViaSat-1 capacity to WildBlue Communications, a 
provider of consumer broadband service and customer of ViaSat’s ground network 
equipment. When both WildBlue and eventual competitor, Hughes, decided not to lease 
capacity, ViaSat purchased WildBlue outright to secure adequate distribution for the new 
satellite. 


 ViaSat-1 was launched on October 19, 2011 and entered commercial service in January 
16, 2012. ViaSat owns one other satellite, WildBlue-1 and has prepaid, leased capacity 
on Anik F2, operated by Telesat. 


 ViaSat-2 will have 2x the capacity (~300Gbps) of ViaSat-1 and after nearly a year of 
delay was launched on June 1, 2017 with an estimated commercial service date 
sometime in 1Q18.

 ViaSat-3 (a planned constellation of 3 satellites, each with 1Tbps of capacity) will follow 
in late 2019/2020. The first of the class will serve the Americas, the second is targeted 
for EMEA, the final one is slated for Asia Pacific but plans remain in development. 
 


ViaSat Satellite Overview 
 





Source:  Kerrisdale estimates, company data.  


1. ViaSat-1 contention ratio based on Kerrisdale research and estimated 100 Kbps per subscriber provisioning. 
2. ViaSat-1 assumes 140 Gbps of rated capacity, less 15 GBps allocated for Barret Explore and 10 Gbps for inflight connectivity. 


ViaSat-2 and ViaSat-3 assumes ~75% of total capacity assigned to residential broadband, in line with published Street 
forecasts. 


 
Satellite Services 
 
Consumer Broadband  
 


 ViaSat provides satellite-based high-speed broadband and value-added services to 
consumers, enterprises, and commercial airlines primarily in the United States. 
Consumer broadband services are offered under the Exede and WildBlue brands. As of 
F3Q17, ViaSat serves 675k total consumer and small business subscribers    


 Consumer Broadband revenue accounts for ~85% of FY17E Satellite Services segment 
revenue (excluding Loral settlement payments) and 33% of FY17E total company 
revenue. Consumer Broadband Services EBITDA accounts for roughly 70% of total 
company EBITDA and drives 70-80% of consensus estimates for total EBITDA growth 
thru FY 2020.  


 ViaSat offers a range of base service plans:

Current Exede Service Plans

 Since hitting capacity limits in 2H14, overall subscriber growth has been nominal. The 
company has lost 20k customers over the last 2 quarters. With EchoStar recently 
launching new satellite capacity and marketing attractively priced plans at 2x the current 
speed offering of ViaSat, we expect losses to accelerate until ViaSat-2 is operational in 
1Q18.  
 


Historical and Projected Total Broadband Subscribers 
 





Source:  Kerrisdale estimates, company filings.  





 Average revenue per user (ARPU) has increased steadily since the launch of ViaSat-1. 
Initial increases were driven by a shift in mix from wholesale subscribers (est. $27
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 48 





ARPU) to a predominantly direct retail model (est. ~$70 ARPU). ARPU increases over 
the past 18 months have been driven by the sale of non-bandwidth related services, 
such as VoIP, “premium” customer care, various equipment fees and installation fees. 
These commoditized non-bandwidth offerings now constitute an estimated ~40% of retail 
ARPU and are subject to erosion in increasingly competitive markets. 
 


Historical and Projected ARPU

In-Flight Connectivity 
 


 ViaSat provides in-flight connectivity (IFC) to the commercial aviation market. It currently 
provides in-flight connectivity to 555 commercial aircraft in service for JetBlue, United 
and Virgin America. We estimate the sub-segment currently accounts for ~4% of total 
revenue.  


 ViaSat’s go-to-market strategy differs from industry leader, Gogo, in that broadband 
capacity is primarily sold wholesale to each airline, with a flat rate and data allocation per 
passenger. It is then up to the airline to brand, price and allocate the service to 
passengers (for example, JetBlue Fly-Fi and United Wi-Fi).  


 ViaSat has contracted to supply in-flight services for the new American Airlines Boeing 
737 MAX fleet as well as 500 existing aircraft for American Airlines. ViaSat and Eutelsat 
together introduced in-flight internet service in Europe with EL AL Israel Airlines and their 
joint venture has signed new European contracts with Finnair and SAS. 


 As part of its government systems segment, ViaSat was awarded an exclusive contract 
to provide in-flight services to Air Force One and other US government aircrafts. It now 
has deployed its government mobile broadband internet service on more than 400 VIP 
government aircraft. (recent industry rumors suggest this contract is at risk)  


 We view ViaSat’s competitive positioning in aviation as favorable and assume Average 
Revenue per Aircraft grows 5-7% p.a. and the IFC installed base grows from 555 aircraft 
to over 1,500 by FY2020E. Our FY2020E forecast of $223m in commercial aviation 
broadband service and product revenue is in line with consensus.  


 There are some notable longer-term risks, however. ViaSat provides wholesale capacity 
to 500 JetBlue and United Airlines aircraft through agreements signed with LiveTV
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC  |  1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor  |  New York, NY 10036  |  Tel: 212.792.7999  |  Fax: 212.531.6153 49 





(originally, a wholly-owned subsidiary of JetBlue). In March 2014, LiveTV was sold to 
Thales, a large, European defense and IFE-focused (In-Flight Entertainment) company. 
In September 2016, Thales signed North American capacity agreements with SES and 
Hughes’ EchoStar in a maneuver designed to possibly replace ViaSat as a supplier. 
ViaSat is at risk of losing a sizable portion of their current online aircraft upon expiration 
of its partnership in 2021. 
 


Commercial Networks  
 


 Commercial Networks develops and produces a variety of end-to-end satellite and 
wireless communication systems, including ground networking equipment, infrastructure 
and space-to-earth connectivity systems. The segment accounts for ~15% of total 
revenue and est. -$(105)m in FY17E EBITDA.  


 ViaSat’s Commercial Network’s business has found success in selling terminals for 
Australia’s next-generation broadband network operated by NBNCo and to airlines for its 
Exede-in-the-Air service. Product revenues in this segment are generated from selling to 
third parties. Main products include:  Ka-band ground terminals, maritime broadband 
terminals and modems, antenna systems, MSS terminals, payload and terminal 
development programs.  


 Topline performance has historically been characterized by the timing of particular 
infrastructure projects, such as the Australian National Broadband Network and the 
awarding of contracts to develop antennas for O3b. Historically, core operating margins 
have been negative to low-single digits. More recently, operating income has been 
significantly pressured by large increases in R&D associated with the payload 
development for ViaSat-3, FCC certification activity, as well as a change in accounting 
requiring certain R&D for the ViaSat-3 program to be expensed rather than capitalized, 
as it is not outsourced. 
 


Government Systems  
 


 Represents the single largest category by revenue (44%) with EBITDA margins of ~24%. 
Segment revenues are 70% product driven, with performance dependent on the 
awarding and timing of government contracts.  


 Main products and services include: 
o Providing military and government users with broadband and multimedia 


connectivity in key regions of the world (ViaSat leases capacity to provide 
coverage in Europe and the Middle East).   


o Government satellite communications systems – a wide array of portable, mobile 
and fixed broadband modems, terminals, networking equipment.  


o In-flight communication for Air Force One and approximately 400 other VIP 
aircraft.  


o Tactical data links systems include BATS-D handheld radio system and MIDS 
terminals for military fighter jets.  


 Visibility is limited in the segment. As with Commercial Networks and Aviation 
Broadband, we forecast financial performance in line with consensus.

V. Valuation 
 


The key driver of our $35 price target for ViaSat is our more conservative view of Consumer 
Broadband. All other segments are modeled in-line with published Street estimates. 
 
A discounted cash flow analysis is typically the preferred method to value satellite companies, 
but with ViaSat, the significantly negative cash flows that dominate the projection period results 
in placing an inordinate amount of value in the terminal value. We are not alone in this problem 
– a recent sell-side initiation report from April derived its entire enterprise value from the NPV of 
2025 terminal value and used an 8.5% WACC. We find this discount rate to be unreasonable 
given the high level of competitive, technological, and execution risk. The discount rate should 
also be materially higher in light of the fact that nearly the entirety of ViaSat’s valuation is based 
on cash flows beyond 2025 due to the negative free cash flow of the preceding years, which 
adds an additional layer of uncertainty to ViaSat’s valuation calculation for DCF purposes. 
 
We value ViaSat by assigning a 9.5x target multiple to our estimate of FY 2020E EBITDA 
adjusted for the level of overstatement due to equipment leases. The company currently trades 
at 10.3x FY 2020E consensus adjusted for expected cash burn. Current net debt is adjusted to 
reflect the anticipated cash burn over the next 4 years. We make no assumption for further 
equity issuance despite the historical tendency to fund cash burn through a 50/50 debt/equity 
mix.  
 
ViaSat’s Satellite Services peers trade at ~7.0x-8.5x 1Yr Fwd. EBITDA.

VI. Conclusion  
 


“I think when we get ViaSat-2, we'll be able to move upstream. The way I like to 
describe it is it's the bear in the woods story. Two guys are out in the woods and, 
all of a sudden, a bear appears. And one of them turns around and starts to run. 
The other guy says, well, you're never going to outrun that bear. And he said, 
well, I don't have to, I just had to outrun you, right? So think of the bear in the 
woods as bandwidth demand. Like, nobody is going to outrun the bear. Basically, 
the way we'll be successful is outrunning the other guys who are also trying to 
deal with that bear, right?” 
 


— Mark Dankberg (CEO of ViaSat, May 14, 2015) 
 
With every passing year, ViaSat falls further and further behind the “other guys” and closer and 
closer to the trailing bear. Dankberg talks at length about taking share against terrestrial 
competitors and expanding ViaSat’s addressable market, but the reality is that the technological 
landscape is worsening for them at an accelerated pace. It is abundantly clear that in the U.S., 
the company doesn’t have a viable way to keep up with other providers of home broadband 
internet. In 2012, they introduced a service that showed at least a few signs of providing a viable 
value proposition to a small segment of the American populace. 6 years later, they’ve dropped 
to the back of the pack. By 2020, they will likely be eaten by the bear. Until then, the company 
continues to burn cash, rely on secularly challenged products like VoIP to prop up subscriber 
metrics, promote an EBITDA metric that is distorted by leasing generic hardware, and at 
conferences typically talk as long as possible about aviation to avoid discussing what’s 
happening in its main business. Current valuations simply don’t reflect that 70% of EBITDA is 
attributable to a business that is destined to disappear for the most party in the near- to 
intermediate term. The price of shares reflects flawless execution of impossible subscriber 
growth and pipe dreams of global expansion. It won’t take long to see the key drivers of the 
consumer business begin to turn the wrong way; when they do, ViaSat shares will come 
crashing back to Earth.

Appendix I – ViaSat-2 IRR Analysis  
 


 Our analysis of ViaSat-2 returns a 9% IRR. 


 Key ViaSat-2 IRR Analysis Assumptions: 


o Our analysis deliberately follows the methodology of the only published Street 


IRR analysis for ViaSat-2. We assume the analyst received some guidance from 


the company and wish to limit our changes to the inputs as much as possible.  


o Our analysis conservatively uses the same length of time, assumes a higher 


contribution from Aviation, and yet results in a lower IRR based on 3 key aspects: 


1. A decline in retail and wholesale ARPU during the initial loading phase of 


the satellite to account for the high levels of non-core service revenues 


that are subject to competitive erosion.  


2. High churn associated with lower-priced plans 


3. Based on several conversations with satellite experts and former 
employees, there is $75m to $100m in ground network capex related to 


the building and upgrading of gateways that is not included in the 


company’s $600-$650m disclosed costs for the satellite.
