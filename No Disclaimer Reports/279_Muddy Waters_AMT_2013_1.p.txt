INTRODUCTION 
 
Investors seeking to own a REIT that is going to rapidly grow its AFFO and dividend for 
as far as the eye can see should not own AMT. 
 
American Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT) is a great story.  However, it is not a great 
company.  Investors think that because wireless data usage in the US is growing rapidly, 
AMT will continue to deliver strong domestic growth year after year.  The growth story 
is enhanced by AMT’s rapid expansion into emerging and frontier markets, supposedly 
positioned to capitalize on the oft-heralded newly moneyed middle classes of India, 
South America, and Africa.  REIT investors see a company with plenty of headroom to 
grow its dividend. 
 
The reality is disappointing. 
 
The best days of the tower business are now behind it.  Unlike traditional real estate, this 
model is susceptible to disruptive technologies.  These technologies are not theoretical – 
in fact, the single largest replacement for the cellular tower is a technology we have all 
used for years: Wi-Fi.  Mark our words, in five years you will be downloading data to 
your PDA or tablet in far greater quantities than today; however, the antennae to which 
you are connecting will seldom be on a cellular tower.  Although tower operators once 
drove efficiency, they have now become rent-seekers.  Carriers cannot afford this model, 
and towers will soon be the most expensive option of last resort. 
 
AMT could have conserved its cash and prepared for a slow growth future with 
compressing margins.  But that is not what it chose to do.  It has embarked on an asset 
binge, seemingly scouring the globe for the most challenging operating environments 
possible.  By borrowing money in US dollars and investing in high yielding countries, it 
is not running a business so much as a hedge fund with substantial execution risks.  
Despite making highly illiquid investments, our models show that its investments usually 
underperform local government bonds.  Germany is an exception – it outperforms 
German government bonds by 200 bps – 4% versus 2%.   
 
AMT pulls the wool over investors’ eyes by operating a de facto lending business 
overseas, often entering into transactions where it will overpay for towers in exchange for 
carriers overpaying rent.  AMT books the principal repayments as rental revenue.  This 
lending artificially boosts EBITDA margins, making the business look more profitable 
than it really is. It also ensures that the promised growth will never come – at least not 
organically.  The REIT-focused investors also do not appreciate how expensive it is to 
repatriate money from many of these countries, thereby making AMT’s international cash 
flow largely inaccessible.
‘Page 6 of 118	
  


There is a potentially unseemly underbelly to AMT’s overseas activities.  As we show in 
this report, there is approximately US$250 million missing from a transaction in which 
AMT bought towers in Brazil.  There are therefore material misstatements in AMT’s 
financials.  (We are providing our research on this matter to the SEC.)  We also note 
indications that there could have been similar problems with transactions years earlier.  
Regardless of what the explanations for these issues ultimately turn out to be, there 
certainly are reasons to question the ethics of senior management.  At the least, we note 
that chairman and CEO James Taiclet is an avid seller of AMT’s shares, disposing of 
approximately 90% of the stock he receives from option exercises.  He appears to be 
leaving investors holding the bag. 


Summary	
  
 
We rate American Tower Corp. (NYSE: AMT) a Strong Sell and value it at $44.57 per 
share, representing a downside of 40.3%.  AMT has serious challenges domestically and 
internationally that have not been factored into the stock price.  It has engaged in a value 
destroying investment binge overseas and we have identified a significant material 
misstatement in the Company’s accounts that could amount to fraud. 
 
There is an approximately US$250 million discrepancy between what AMT claims to 
have paid for the acquisition of towers in Brazil, and the actual selling price.  AMT 
claimed to have paid US$585.4 million for the towers, but the real price was close to 
US$300 million.  Our analysis is based on financial statements of the company AMT 
acquired, Central Bank of Brazil records, and six industry sources, including two who 
had direct knowledge of the closed transaction.  If AMT is aware of this discrepancy, it 
would amount to fraud.  We have provided our research to the SEC. 
 
There are reasons to question the ethics of AMT’s management.  In addition to Chairman 
and CEO James Taiclet having led the company during some of its admitted option 
backdating, other senior management shows a disturbing propensity to push the ethical 
envelope.  In addition, AMT’s audit committee chair is also the audit committee chair of 
NII Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: NIHD), which has been an AMT counterparty in the past.  
There is a disturbing discrepancy in the historical accounts for a series of tower sales and 
leasebacks between the two companies.  
 
AMT’s compensation incentivizes value destructive acquisitions by compensating 
management in part on tower growth, regardless of the quality of acquisitions.  While 
management’s performance benchmarks are adjusted for currency fluctuations, 
shareholders have no such protection.  Mr. Taiclet’s consistent sale of approximately 
90% of the shares he receives from option exercises suggests a lack of faith in the 
sustainability of AMT’s business – ironically, this is a view we share with him. 
 
AMT’s international business is in part a de facto lending business that artificially 
inflates revenue, EBITDA, and AFFO.  AMT effectively lends money to tower operators, 
and then books their principal repayments as rental revenue.  This line of business also 
makes it substantially harder for AMT to grow organically.  The only way to produce
‘Page 7 of 118	
  


growth is to “feed the beast” and make more and more (often value destructive) 
acquisitions.  This model of “growth” is impossible to sustain. 
 
AMT’s international business is also part carry trade and part levered directional currency 
bet.  AMT’s model is to fund in US dollars and invest in high yielding countries, where 
high local interest rates cause rent yields to be higher than in the US.  However, AMT 
often underperforms local government bonds.  Considering that AMT has substantial 
execution risk layered on top of the high local rates, and it is invested in illiquid assets, 
investors are faring poorly.  AMT does not hedge its exposure to the myriad emerging 
and frontier market currencies to which it is exposed, making it also a levered directional 
currency bet.  This bet has resoundingly gone south this year. 
 
AMT’s international IRRs are generally poor, and far below the cost of capital.   We 
obtained granular data on all of AMT’s operations and found that the international 
businesses have a much higher risk profile than the US operations.  We analyzed the 
IRRs for four countries: India, Brazil, Ghana, and Germany.  In the case of the first three, 
AMT’s IRRs are no greater than those of the local currency government bonds.  AMT is 
outperforming German government bonds, but is only generating a 4% IRR.   
 
While wireless data usage will grow, much of this growth will circumvent cellular 
towers.  Tower operators have gone from drivers of efficiency to rent-seekers, and 
carriers, with compressing margins, cannot afford the status quo.  Going forward we 
expect domestic growth to slow and international markets to remain volatile with 
increasing headwinds to growth.  Wi-Fi and more recently introduced technologies are 
making towers the most expensive option of last resort.  AMT faces rising ground rents in 
the US due to the ground rent market becoming more efficient due to the internet and the 
ubiquity of cellular phones. 
 
US tower industry growth has peaked, and we expect limited revenue per tenant growth 
and stagnant tenancy ratios.  Domestic sales growth has been driven by contractual 
escalators, and excess charges (“amendments”) that carriers pay to add network 
equipment.  Carriers do not like the pricing structure and its substance.  By using Wi-Fi 
and new generation antennae that combine multiple generations into smaller equipment 
and enable carriers to share network equipment (the logical evolution from sharing 
towers), tower companies will be marginal players in US carriers’ future network growth.  
History does not repeat itself, but it rhymes.  We have previously seen tower suffer due to 
technological changes (i.e., when paging companies became irrelevant many tower 
companies were forced into bankruptcy).  While we do not expect AMT to go bankrupt, 
we do not expect it to continue to post strong US growth numbers beginning in the near 
future. 
 
AMT’s REIT-focused investors will be disappointed by their inability to access AMT’s 
overseas cash flows.  Of all of the international operations, only Mexico is in the REIT 
structure.  All other regions are subject to corporate taxation.  Investors seem not to 
appreciate how expensive and difficult it would be for AMT to repatriate its overseas
‘Page 8 of 118	
  


cash flow.  Crown Castle, Inc. (NYSE: CCI) notably states that the REIT structure is 
incompatible with emerging market tower operations. 
 
AMT is operating in challenging markets, and without sufficient risk management.  Poor 
quality due diligence (i.e., only inspecting 10% of towers before closing purchases) has 
likely led to model-busting capital expenditures.  More stringent tower regulations are 
also expected to increase costs and negatively impact margins. Capricious governments 
are always a wild card that AMT faces in emerging and frontier markets. 
 
Wall Street is setting investors up for a fall in AMT.  We have reviewed five analyst 
models, and it is clear that they do not understand the company or know how to model it.  
They use widely varying assumptions, but (surprise!) seem to largely agree on the value.  
Investors should be particularly wary given that we are in a REIT bubble, as evidenced 
by investors’ day-to-day fortunes being tied to the words of Federal Reserve chairman 
Ben Bernanke.   


US$250 MILLION DISCREPANCY IN AMT’S US$585.4 MILLION 
TOWER ACQUISITION IN BRAZIL.  THE MATERIAL 
MISSTATEMENT COULD AMOUNT TO FRAUD. 
 
There is a US$250 million material misstatement in AMT’s accounting for a purportedly 
US$585.4 million tower acquisition in Brazil.  It is difficult to see how the Company 
would be unaware of this misstatement; and, if AMT is in fact aware of the discrepancy, 
it would amount to fraud.  AMT disclosed paying US$585.4 million for 666 towers in 
Brazil in 2011.  It is highly probable that the real consideration for the towers was only 
approximately US$335 million.  However, AMT’s accounts reflect the US$585.4 million 
purchase consideration.  We have provided our findings to the SEC, and we call upon 
AMT’s board to thoroughly and transparently investigate this transaction.   
 
This purchase was the only transaction that we scrutinized in detail, and given the 
cultural and control problems we believe are endemic to AMT (see infra), along with its 
substantial emerging and frontier market investments, we would not be surprised to learn 
of similar problems in other transactions.  As we discuss infra, we note a potentially 
similar, albeit smaller, discrepancy in a series of transactions with NII Holdings, Inc. 
(NASDAQ: NIHD).  AMT and NIHD have the same audit committee chair.

September 7, 2011, announcing the acquisition of a portfolio of properties held by various limited liability
‘Page 9 of 118	
  


US$420 million to US$585.4 million, purportedly starting with 565 sites and ultimately 
becoming 666 sites.  
 
On February 28, 2011, AMT announced that it was acquiring 100% of the shares of a 
company that owned 565 sites in Brazil for approximately US$420 million.2 The 
acquisition was to close on March 1, 2011 (the day after this filing), and achieve financial 
close on June 1, 2011.3  The per tower price would have been US$743,000, which also 
would have been by far the most AMT had ever paid for towers overseas. 
 
Barely two months later, AMT announced that on March 1, 2011 – literally the day after 
it filed its 2010 10-K that cited the aforementioned deal terms – AMT had closed the 
acquisition, but for a larger amount of towers and money.  In the new filing, AMT 
disclosed that on March 1, 2011, it had acquired 627 sites for approximately US$553 
million, which was a per tower valuation of US$882,000.4  On a conference call held the 
same day, AMT CEO and chairman James Taiclet explained that AMT upsized the deal 
by 62 towers after completing its due diligence, and that “There may be up to an 
additional 40 sites under construction that [AMT] will acquire over the next several 
months”.5  When AMT filed its 2011 10-K in 2012, we learned that the transaction had 
been purportedly upsized again to 666 towers for US$585.4 million.6  This works out to a 
per tower price of US$879,000.   
 
Muddy Waters became interested in this transaction at first because the per tower 
valuation was so high.  The price of US$879,000 is high even by US tower price 
standards, which is approximately US$656,000 in recent years.  The disparity is even 
greater when compared to other international transactions, which often have purchase 
prices inflated by AMT’s de facto lending business.  Below is a graph setting out AMT’s 
per tower purchase prices for international acquisitions.  Many of these transactions 
reflect the de facto lending business’s purchase price inflation effects.7  We would not be 
surprised if there are similar problems with other transactions – we researched in depth 
only one transaction and quickly saw a major problem that amounts to fraud, unless AMT 
can provide some exonerating explanation.

To identify the seller, we searched AMT’s Brazilian corporate documents through an 
online government portal, and saw that on March 3, 2011, AMT resolved to buy the 
shares of Site Sharing NE S.A.8   
 
We then obtained financial statements for Site Sharing NE and the parent from which it 
was spun out, Site Sharing do Brasil Empreendimentos em Telecomunicações S.A. (“Site 
Sharing Brazil”, and together with Site Sharing NE, “Site Sharing”).  It is common 
practice for privately-held companies in Brazil to file their financial statements publicly.9   
 


The	
  Problem	
  
 
Site Sharing’s financial statements and Central Bank of Brazil (“BCB”) records make 
clear that the consideration for Site Sharing NE was only approximately US$335 million, 
approximately US$250 million less than disclosed.  AMT’s initial PP&E allocation 
confirms the accuracy of Site Sharing’s financial statements.  Conversations with six 
industry sources, including people who had been shopped the transaction, and at least two 
people with direct knowledge of the closed transaction, all confirmed that the purchase 
price was in the US$300 million range.10

AMT discloses (to this day) that it paid 12x to 13x EBITDA for Site Sharing.  Giving 
AMT every benefit of the doubt,11 the EBITDA of Site Sharing should have been at least 
BRL 70 million, yet in the year ended December 31, 2010 it was no more than BRL 45.5 
million. 12  We are left wondering what Mr. Taiclet knew and did not know.  He made the 
following statements about the transaction on the May 3, 2011 conference call: 
 


James Taiclet: “The sites we acquired in Brazil are high performing towers and 
the multiple pay was in the range of 12x to 13x adjusted EBITDA.” 
… 
	
  
Philip Cusick, Macquarie: “This is Richard Choe for Phil.  Going into the Brazil 
deal, I guess it was upsized a little bit and you said you paid 12x to 13x cash flow.  
Was that because the incremental sites were higher or was this kind of looking 
back and kind of re-upping the price for the sites?...” 
	
  
James Taiclet, Executive Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President: 
“Richard, it's Jim Taiclet. Basically, what happened with our Brazil transaction is 
the purchase prices adjusted for the actual cash flows that were occurring up the 
towers new and existing in the deal. But the bulk of it was driven by the new 
towers that were completed and ready to transfer. So those both contributed…” 


 
The EBITDA AMT was implying for Site Sharing at that time was at least 53.5% higher 
than Site Sharing’s actual EBITDA.  We combined the income statements of Site Sharing 
NE with those of Site Sharing Brazil to analyze whether their EBITDA jibed with AMT’s 
disclosures.  Site Sharing NE was a subsidiary of Site Sharing Brazil.  Site Sharing NE 
SA was incorporated on March 3, 2008, likely in preparation for a sale of the towers.  
Site Sharing Brazil transferred all assets into Site Sharing NE by September 10, 2010.  
The transferred assets included up to 687 rooftop and tower sites.13  We combined the 
two sets of financials in order to calculate the maximum EBITDA that Site Sharing NE 
could have generated. 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
11 Mr. Taiclet said that the additional 40 sites AMT might acquire were under construction, so the implied 
EBITDA is based on the size of the transaction as it stood the day he discussed the valuation, and using an 
EBITDA multiple of 13x in order to give the Company the maximum benefit of the doubt. 
12 Based on the March 1, 2011 (deal closing date) rate 1.665 BRL.  Using the average rate of BRL 1.760 
during 2010 would have implied an EBITDA of BRL 74.9 million.  Using the rate of BRL 1.59 on May 3, 
2011, the implied EBITDA would have been BRL 67.6 million. 
13 There was a schedule of assets transferred, which gave the highest numbered tower as 687; however, 
fewer than 678 towers were actually listed in the schedule.

AMT’s initial purchase price allocation for the acquisition confirms Site Sharing’s 
combined financial statements.  AMT initially allocated US$33.2 million to PP&E.14  Per 
the Brazilian financial statements, the book value of Site Sharing’s combined PP&E as of 
December 31, 2010 was US$32.3 million (BRL 53.6 million).  It appears as though AMT 
initially allocated to PP&E based on Site Sharing’s PP&E carrying value, with the slight 
US$ difference due to currency fluctuations.  Thus, AMT’s disclosure confirms the 
Brazilian financial statements of Site Sharing Brazil and Site Sharing NE.  (Note that the 
EBITDA margin is so high because of Site Sharing’s abnormally high rents, which were 
apparently up to 3.0x market on some towers.) 
 
At 12.0x to 13.0x EBITDA, AMT would have paid US$327.6 million to US$354.9 
million, as shown below. 
 


 
 
Central Bank of Brazil (“BCB”) records make clear that the total consideration paid was 
only approximately US$335 million.  The Brazilian Real (BRL) is a controlled currency, 
and by law all exchanges into BRL must be registered with the BCB within 30 days of 
closing.  The BCB has made available records of all such forex transactions through 
December 2011 on its website.  AMT injected US$335.0 million into its Brazil subs in 
May 2011.  It had not injected any money in almost two years.  The last time it had 
injected money, it transferred US$46.0 million to fund a US$50.5 million tower 
acquisition.15,16  Previously, the largest amount AMT had ever injected into Brazil in one

month was only US$7.0 million, which was when its Brazil business was much younger 
and presumably free cash flow negative.17  
 
The graph below shows AMT’s USD injections to its Brazil subsidiaries by quarter 
between Q1 2006 and Q2 2011, and the deltas to acquisition consideration.   
 


 
 
AMT’s disclosures regarding the amounts and timing of money it purports to have paid 
make clear that its accounts contain material misstatements.  AMT purports to have 
(partially) paid the selling shareholders US$419.2 million in March 2011.  In its Q1 10-
Q, AMT stated: 
 


“On March 1, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of a 
company that owned 627 towers in Brazil for $553.2 million, of which $419.2 
million was paid using cash on hand in March 2011.”18 


 
Putting aside that AMT overstated the purchase price, it almost certainly would not have 
injected US$335 million into Brazil in May 2011 if the preceding statement were true.  It 
would have only owed needed to pay US$124.1 million to $166.1 million to complete the

USD Injections Consideration Delta

transaction.19  AMT made no other tower purchases in Brazil in 2011.  This amount is 
enormously more than AMT would have needed for its operations, particularly 
considering it appears to have been free cash flow positive in Brazil for at least two years, 
judging by the absence of other injections.   
 
The Q2 2011 disclosure is more egregious: 
 


“On March 1, 2011, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of a 
company that owned 650 communications sites in Brazil for $583.7 million, of 
which $543.3 million was paid using cash on hand during the six months ended 
June 30, 2011.”20 


 
Regarding the extremely remote chance that AMT paid an additional US$250 million to 
the selling shareholders offshore (and the Site Sharing financials are wrong, the six 
sources are all wrong, and the Q1 2011 US$419.2 million disclosure never happened), 
AMT would have been taking a significant risk.  Even though the parties could attempt to 
call such a payment something other than tower purchase consideration (e.g., consulting 
fees), AMT would be at risk of abetting the selling shareholders, who are Brazilian, in 
committing tax fraud.  This is not something that multinationals with approximately 
US$1 billion invested in Brazil would usually do. 
 
Going further into Fantasyland, if the reason AMT wanted US$335 million cash in Brazil 
in May 2011 had nothing to do with the Site Sharing NE purchase, AMT would have lost 
substantial money by converting the currency in May 2011 and leaving it on deposit.  
AMT executed its next Brazil transaction (i.e., its next major use of cash) on March 30, 
2012.21  In May 2011, the average exchange rate was 1.614, which was close to its all 
time high.  On March 30, 2012, the rate was 1.823, which would have been a loss of 
11.5%.  That alone would have been a US$41.0 million drawdown, which would be a 
firing offense in most companies that could afford to lose that kind of money without 
going out of business. 
 


Dodgy Valuation Firm 
 
Every now and then, we at Muddy Waters reminisce about projects past – especially 
when a current project bears a striking similarity to a previous one.  AMT gave us the 
opportunity to stroll down Memory Lane when we looked up information on the 
accounting firm AMT used to appraise Site Sharing NE.  This brought to mind the photos 
of the sham Sino-Forest customers that were purportedly purchasing US$400 million per 
year of product, while operating out of run down apartments in remote parts of China. 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
19 This range results from subtracting $419.2 million from both the $585.3 million AMT claims to have 
been obligated to pay, as well as from the $543.3 million AMT claims to have paid by the end of Q2 2011.

Something to Keep in Mind 
 
One bit of information that caught our attention, and might be relevant to the discrepancy 
are forum postings by someone calling himself Enki Ea.  Without further evidence, the 
following should be discounted, but kept in mind.  The posting, appearing in the 
comment section of articles or videos on numerous financial websites, including Zero 
Hedge, Max Keiser, and Bloomberg, is a posting titled “CRIME/TERROR/WEAPONS 
Bank in South America...” The post discusses a small Brazilian bank that purportedly is 
in the center of money laundering for narco-traffickers, corrupt Brazilian politicians, and 
even someone linked to Hezbollah.  The post then names seven individuals whom it 
alleges are the “main culprits”.  One of the individuals named is Flavio Guimaraes.24   
 
Flávio Ognibene Guimarães was the majority shareholder of Site Sharing Brazil via his 
company Ltda Sestri Empreendimentos e Participações Ltda.  Mr. Guimarães also owned 
shares in his own name in Site Sharing NE when it was sold to AMT.25  We contacted 
and spoke with the author of these posts to query whether he is referring to Mr. 
Guimarães of Site Sharing.  The poster, whose real identity we do not know, stated that 
he is familiar with Site Sharing Brazil, and that Site Sharing’s Mr. Guimarães is indeed 
the same individual to whom he is referring. 
 
We want to be clear that we have been unable to document these allegations by "Enki Ea" 
and have no indication at all that AMT has any involvement in any activities of Mr. 
Guimarães other than purchasing a company of which Mr. Guimarães was the controlling 
shareholder.  However, given the irregularities surrounding the purchase of this Brazilian 
subsidiary, we are of the definite view that any independent investigation or interested 
regulator should examine the involvement of Mr. Guimarães in the transaction. 


IS UNETHICAL (EVEN ILLEGAL) BEHAVIOR IN AMT’S 
CORPORATE DNA?  AT THE LEAST, WE SEE A CORPORATE 
CULTURE THAT REWARDS UNMANAGED RISKS. 
 
We perceive that AMT has at the least an unethical streak in its culture, with two or more 
current senior executives having had some role in illegal activity at AMT in the past.  
While investors might recall AMT’s option backdating scandal, the highly questionable 
(albeit not illegal) behavior of AMT’s EVP of International Operations / president of 
Latin America is surprising – particularly because he, a former CPA, was serving as 
AMT’s general counsel at the time of the backdating and unrelated behavior that netted 
him over US$10 million in backdoor compensation.  We also have questions surrounding 
the present dual role played by the chairwoman of AMT’s audit committee, Carolyn 
Katz, who also chairs the audit committee at NII Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: NIHD).  
NIHD is a potentially significant AMT counterparty, and there have been some troubling

discrepancies in the past between the way the two companies disclose their sides of past 
transactions with each other.  Industry sources speculate that AMT and NIHD are close to 
completing another transaction, which would likely range from US$500 million to US$1 
billion in value. 
 


AMT’s Poor Corporate Governance DNA 
 
In 2006, AMT settled a stock option backdating class action lawsuit for $14 million after 
admitting that it did in fact illegally backdate options.26  According to a 2006 Center for 
Financial Research and Analysis report, AMT was one of the more egregious backdater 
of options.27  Several senior AMT executives and board members departed in the wake of 
the scandal; others did not.   
 
The plaintiff with whom AMT settled alleged that the backdating continued into 2005.28  
Jim Taiclet became president of the Company in September, 2001; CEO in October, 
2003; and, chairman in February, 2004.  In addition to holding positions of authority 
during the time that AMT was backdating options, Mr. Taiclet was alleged in the class 
action complaint to have received backdated options.29  Yet, he remained at the 
Company.  We wonder why there was not a more thorough housecleaning; and, we 
wonder whether those who escaped relatively unscathed took away the wrong lessons 
from the episode.   
 
However, our concern is more acute with William “Hal” Hess, who had been AMT’s 
general counsel from 2002 until 2007.  This covers much of the period when the 
backdating occurred.  In addition to being an attorney, he previously practiced as a CPA.  
It would be hard to find somebody who would seem to know more about proper 
corporate governance than he.  Mr. Hess is now AMT’s executive vice president of 
international operations and president of Latin America, and is one of Mr. Taiclet’s five 
direct reports.30   
 
What really concerns us about Mr. Hess is that while he was general counsel, he earned 
profits of approximately US$11.3 million exercising options for stakes in two of AMT’s 
Latin American subsidiaries: ATC Mexico and ATC South America.  Fortune Magazine 
called this practice “backdoor options filtered through a subsidiary”.31  The gist of the 
episode was that Mr. Hess received options to purchase equity stakes in the two (non-
public) subsidiaries, and the Company was obligated to buy the shares back from him

27 In Re American Tower Corp. Securities Litigation, Case No. 06-CV-10933, U.S.D.C, D. Mass. (2006) 
28 In re American Tower Corp. Securities Litigation, Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint. 
29 Id., para. 40, 44, 45.  The Amended Complaint further alleges that one instance of the option backdating 
in which Taiclet received 125,000 options was timed to occur the day before the AMT purchase of 
approximately 535 towers from NII Holdings (NIHD) on December 10, 2002.  Id., para. 45-46.  We discuss 
inconsistencies in AMT's and NIHD's accounting for later sales of towers below in this report.

and AMT bought the shares back from him after very short holding periods, and at 
valuations far greater than what he had paid.   
 
Mr. Hess’s transactions were disclosed in footnotes to the proxy statements.  However, 
this type of arrangement had the effect of keeping Mr. Hess’s full compensation out of 
the compensation table portion of the proxy statement, which possibly caused a large 
number of shareholders to be unaware of his total compensation.  While all corporate 
executives owe a fiduciary duty to the shareholders, we find it particularly troubling 
when a general counsel engages in such aggressive practices.  General counsels are 
(theoretically) part of the controls that protect shareholders.   
 
We also have concerns regarding the overlapping board memberships of Carolyn Katz, 
who presently chairs the audit committees for both AMT and NIHD.  Ms. Katz joined 
AMT’s board and audit committee in 2004.32  She became chairwoman of AMT’s audit 
committee in 2007.33  Ms. Katz was also a defendant in the backdated options class 
action lawsuit discussed above, although the Amended Complaint appears to allege only 
that she colluded in the practice and not that she personally received backdated options.  
She has been a member of NIHD’s board since 2002,34 and has chaired NIHD’s audit 
committee since as early as 2004.35  The problem is that both NIHD and AMT carry on 
their balance sheets towers than AMT purchased in 2003 through 2008.36  Moreover, the 
two companies do not agree on the number of towers purchased, and in possible 
foreshadowing to the Site Sharing US$250 million discrepancy, AMT has consistently 
reported purchasing 34 more towers than NIHD reports selling.  This differential has 
translated into AMT booking consideration payments to NIHD that are higher than what 
NIHD has recognized by US$6 million to US$7 million.37 
 
AMT states that as of December 31, 2003, it had acquired 665 towers from NIHD for 
US$112.4 million.  During this same period NIHD reports it sold only 631 towers for 
US$106.4 million.38  Note that AMT claims to have acquired 34 more towers than NIHD 
acknowledges selling, and AMT claimed to pay US$6.0 million more than NIHD claims 
to have received.39  While US$6.0 million and 34 towers normally would not be a 
material amount for a company of AMT’s size, we strongly believe that in light of the 
US$250 million discrepancy in the Site Sharing transaction, the transactions with NIHD 
should be closely examined for possible impropriety – particularly to see whether there is 
a relationship to the Site Sharing consideration and possibly that of other transactions.

Also strangely, both companies are presently carrying these towers on their balance 
sheets.  We believe that NIHD’s accounting is erroneous in this instance, rather than 
AMT’s; however, Ms. Katz has been on both boards and audit committees around the 
time of the transactions and during the companies’ ongoing reporting.  We do not know 
how to interpret these facts, but we have yet to think of an explanation that gives us 
comfort. 
 
NIHD’s annual disclosures on this transaction repeatedly report this sale and leaseback as 
a financing transaction wherein NIHD maintains these tower assets on its balance sheet.  
The below excerpt is from NIHD’s 2004 10-K: 
 
 





 
 
To summarize the above disclosure: 
 


• NII accounts for the sale as a financing arrangement and did not recognize a gain 
or loss from the sale,40 


• The proceeds from the sale are treated as financing obligations repaid through 
monthly rents for 15 years,41 


• Tower rent payments are recognized as interest expenses and ground rent 
obligations would be represented as operational expenses,42 


• The tower assets remain on NII’s balance sheet43 
• NIHD recognizes co-location rents as other operating revenues a portion of which 


is recognized as “interest expenses”.44

NII has been disclosing its retention of the towers on its balance sheet every year since 
2002, and in subsequent years NII has expanded the level of detail and increased the 
thoroughness of the description.45  
 
If AMT has not yet finalized its expected purchase of approximately 4,500 towers in 
Brazil and Mexico from NIHD,46 we encourage the independent, disinterested directors 
to take a critical look at this transaction.47  Our industry contacts in Brazil informed us 
that NIHD has been informally shopping this portfolio as a sale and lease-back in an 
attempt to entice buyers to join the formal which bidding began in January.48  NIHD is in 
weak financial shape. 49 Apparently many potential bidders are reluctant to take the credit 
risk particularly given that there is a real chance NIHD will be acquired by another 
carrier and eventually consolidate infrastructure.  This tower sale would likely be in the 
range of US$500 million to US1.0 billion.  Not only should investors keep in mind the 
aforementioned overlapping board and reporting issues, but they should note that AMT’s 
compensation structure (not unlike pre-financial crisis banks) incentivizes AMT to make 
acquisitions, regardless of whether they create or destroy value. 
 


AMT’s Compensation Incentivizes Value Destruction; CCI is More Prudent 
 
Regardless of controls and culture, AMT’s compensation structure goes a long way 
toward explaining why it is destroying value through poor quality and risky international 
acquisitions.  Both Mr. Taiclet and Mr. Hess were compensated in part for growing the 
tower base through acquisitions.50  We understand that other AMT international 
managers are also incentivized to buy towers.  As we detail throughout this report, AMT 
places much more emphasis on quantity than quality.   
 
It is inappropriate that AMT adjusts management’s financial performance goals for 
currency fluctuations.51  As we detail infra, AMT’s international business model is part 
levered currency bet because it does not hedge its FX exposure.  If investors do not 
receive the benefit of hedging, neither should management.  This structure insulates 
management from the substantial risks AMT takes in currencies alone.

transactions, do not mistake our praise for this relatively more transparent disclosure by NII as expressing 
an opinion on the quality of its accounting.

We believe that the financial targets should however be adjusted to exclude the impact of 
AMT’s de facto lending business, in which it books loan repayments as revenue, thereby 
artificially boosting EBITDA margins and other operating metrics (see AMT’s De Facto 
Lending Business Explained). 
 
We are inclined to take a skeptical view of any company whose CEO sells substantially 
all of the shares he acquires from option exercises.  CEOs ideally think about the share 
price years down the road, and manage accordingly.  CEOs who are big sellers of shares 
tend to be overly-focused on the short-term.  In today’s world of lackluster growth, high 
leverage, and stretched valuations, trading the future for the present has more deleterious 
consequences than ever.  We have the impression that many of AMT’s emerging and 
frontier markets investments are driven more by a desire to have a “story” than a 
sustainable business.  (We have a similar opinion of AMT’s decision to convert to a 
REIT, which we see as being incompatible with its geographic scope).  The tower 
operators’ halcyon days are at an end, and AMT would have been far better served 
investing its cash in other ways. 
 
We see the specific causes of AMT’s overseas value destruction as being CEO and senior 
management compensation tied to international tower acquisitions, including sale and 
leaseback lending transactions,52 and CEO compensation tied to stock price 
performance.53  To exacerbate this, AMT CEO Jim Taiclet sells approximately 90% of 
the shares he receives from option exercises, as shown in the table below.  Substantially 
all buys are from option exercises. 
 


 
 
We make comparisons to Crown Castle International Corp. (NYSE: CCI) throughout this 
report because it is managed in a much more sustainable and prudent fashion than is 
AMT.  We note the following superior aspects of CCI’s corporate governance and 
compensation: 
 


• CCI separates the chairman and CEO positions. 
• CCI does not compensate senior management for tower acquisitions.

AMT’S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS IS A DE FACTO LENDING 
BUSINESS, AND ARTIFICIALLY BOOSTS AMT’S REVENUE, 
EBITDA, AND PROFIT, WHILE SHARPLY CURTAILING GROWTH 
PROSPECTS.   
 
AMT’s international business is part tower operator and part lender to its anchor tenants.  
This presents several significant issues.  Because AMT books these loan repayments (i.e. 
return legs of financial round trips) as rent revenue, the repayments artificially inflate 
AMT’s revenue, gross profit, EBITDA, and AFFO.  AMT guides investors to forecast 
annual international revenue growth of 10% to 12%; but, because rents from anchor 
tenants are often partly loan repayments, adding tenants to the towers generates relatively 
little growth.  Thus, AMT is forced to spend more money and make more loans in order 
to meet these expectations – in other words, it has to keep feeding the beast.  The biggest 
growth issue though is that when the initial leaseback terms end, the anchor tenants’ rents 
usually reset much lower, and growth becomes significantly negative.  AMT’s 
counterparties can be risky credits, and these de facto loans significantly increase 
counterparty risk.  These loans are part of the reason why AMT often generates IRRs 
lower than government bonds in three of the four markets we analyzed, and these loans 
serve only to exacerbate the value destruction.  There might be adverse tax effects of this 
business that further depress IRRs. 
 


AMT’s De Facto Lending Business Explained 
 
When AMT purchases a tower from a carrier and leases it back, both parties have the 
opportunity to structure the transaction in a way that improves the optics of their 
financials.  If AMT pays an amount above market for the tower in exchange for the 
carrier paying an above market rent, it confers the following (investor unfriendly) 
benefits on the parties: 
 


• The carrier shows more cash on its balance sheet. 
• The carrier’s liability is off balance sheet. 
• AMT shows more assets. 
• AMT engineers more revenue, and at a 100% pretax profit margin, thereby 


making its income metrics more impressive in the short-term. 
 
The typical monthly market rent in emerging markets is now about US$1,000 per tenant 
per tower.  (Industry sources state that carrier rents can be as low as US$300 per month 
where there is a single antenna and no ground space required.)  Market rents are what 
carriers pay to co-locate on a tower, or in the case of a new tower, to have a tower 
operator build to suit.  In sale and leasebacks, as well as build to suits, lease terms are 
usually 10 years.  The build to suit price of a tower in EM depends on several factors, but 
is often between US$100,000 to US$150,000.  In this price range, carriers are willing to 
build their own towers; or, they might prefer to have a tower operator build the tower, 
and lease it from the carrier for approximately US$1,000 per month.
‘Page 23 of 118	
  


 
If AMT is buying a tower from a carrier, two other major factors come into play: the age 
of the tower, and its construction quality.  Both of these will determine whether AMT 
needs to spend money, and how much, in order to co-locate tenants on the tower.   
 
Assume for the sake of simplicity that Carrier A owns a single tenant tower – in other 
words, it is the only tenant.  After making allowances for any maintenance cap ex, AMT 
determines that it is willing to pay US$100,000 for the tower with a market rent back of 
US$1,000 per month with CPI escalators.  If Carrier A realizes that AMT is a deep-
pocketed aggressive company with low funding costs, it might tell AMT that it wants 
$150,000 for the tower.  AMT might very well pay that inflated price, but in exchange it 
would receive inflated rent.   
 


How Lending Distorts AMT’s Income Statement 
 
Using the simple example above, assume that AMT and Carrier A agree that there are 
three options: 
 


• US$100,000 market purchase, 10-year market leaseback at US$1,000 per month. 
• US$125,000 purchase, 10-year leaseback at US$1,250 per month. 
• US$150,000 purchase, 10-year leaseback at US$1,500 per month. 


 
We will use a 3% annual rent and expense escalator, and will assume that monthly cash 
operating expenses are US$400.  As shown below, by increasing the price it pays for the 
tower, AMT increases its EBITDA margin from 60.0% to 73.3%. 
 


 
 
As shown in the table below, the IRR drops as AMT pays above market price, assuming 
that there is a linear relationship between overpayments and over-rents.  We explain how 
we calculate these IRRs below.  (We analyze AMT’s IRRs in four overseas markets infra, 
concluding that investments in all four should be significantly impaired, and that the 
investments return less than government bonds.) 
 


 
 
AMT can easily end up generating lower transaction IRRs when it lends money to the 
carriers.  The hypothetical above assumes:
‘Page 24 of 118	
  


• AMT is able to depreciate or amortize the entire amount of the asset purchase 
over 10 years.  This ensures that we are assuming these transactions are tax 
neutral.  In reality, AMT might be paying additional local tax due to these 
transactions (see Potentially Adverse Tax Treatment Due to Booking Principal 
Repayments As Revenue infra).   


• We assumed a local corporate tax rate of 25%.   
• Assumes no co-locations – we are only modeling the anchor tenant economics. 
• We assumed no maintenance cap ex or expenses other than US$400 per month, 


and we have allocated no corporate SG&A. 
• At the termination of the 10-year leases, Carrier A’s rent reverts to market, which 


we have assumed increased by 3% per year from the commencement of the lease. 
• To calculate terminal value, we assumed a WACC of 9.5% (which we believe is 


conservative, as we explain in Appendix A.5: Cost of Capital) and a long-term 
growth rate of 3%.  Neither of these assumptions affect whether IRR decreases 
through lending. 


 
One of the issues for investors trying to understand this business model is that rents do 
not necessarily move in a linear fashion with above market multiples.  There are 
qualitative factors that affect tower operators’ decision making process with respect to 
these negotiations with carriers, so it is very difficult for investors to understand what 
IRRs AMT generates on these transactions.  The Company has stated internal IRR 
hurdles, but as we detail infra in this report, AMT’s stated IRR hurdle rates are too low 
for the markets in which they operate, and our models show that AMT will likely not 
achieve its IRR hurdles for most of these markets. 
 


Lending Model is Inherently Lower Growth 
 
When AMT lends money to a carrier as part of a sale and leaseback, it creates two 
impediments to future growth.  First, co-locations do not move the needle as much as 
AMT would like investors to believe. Second, the carrier’s rent will most likely reset to 
market rates (i.e. significantly lower) at the end of the initial leaseback period.  
 
The table below shows the revenue CAGRs over 10 years with co-locating 0.1 tenants (at 
market) for the full year, beginning at the commencement of Year 2.   
 


10-Year Revenue CAGR 
     
Market 10.6% 
1.25x 
Market 9.4% 
1.5x 
Market 8.5% 


 
 
The leaseback agreements are generally 10 years.  When the lease ends, and the anchor 
tenant’s rent resets to market, the drag on growth is substantial.  The table below shows
‘Page 25 of 118	
  


the YOY changes in Year 11 revenue and EBITDA, assuming in Year 11, the tenants per 
tower ratio grows by 0.1 (to 2.0).   
 


 
 
AMT will likely respond to the foregoing by pointing out that its leasebacks provide for 
renewal rates at the above market rates.  We understand that it is rare that a carrier renews 
above market.  The carriers understand that they have repaid the loan, and are reluctant to 
pay more than market. 
 
Overseas, the leverage is firmly on the carriers’ side.  This is an important point for US 
investors to understand not only in the context of the de facto lending business, but in all 
aspects of the international business.  The third party tower operator came into being in 
the US right at the transition from analog to digital, and before the cell phone became 
ubiquitous.  The transition to independent operators happened quickly, and in their haste, 
the US carriers ceded too much leverage to the tower operators.  As we discuss infra, this 
pendulum is now finally swinging back the other way.  However, we believe that foreign 
carriers have learned valuable lessons at the expense of the US carriers about how to 
work with the tower operators and not lose the advantage.  Jay Brown of Crown Castle, 
Inc. (NYSE: CCI) hit the nail on the head when he talked about overseas moats: 
 


“…as we look at emerging markets, we just have not gotten comfortable that the 
moats around the business are anywhere close to as good as the U.S. and the 
credit quality of the tenants who are willing to co-locate or to sell their assets in 
those markets, at least up until this point has not been, to us, has not had the right 
risk reward ratio there.”54  
 


In practice when AMT’s overseas above market leases have come up for renewal, the 
carriers have usually negotiated the rents downward.  AMT might get some build to suit 
business in return for ignoring the specified renewal rate.  AMT cannot muscle the 
overseas carriers around – it has too few towers in these markets, and is dependent on a 
limited number of customers.  That factor is particularly acute with Telefónica and 
American Movil, which are its customers in multiple markets.  If push really came to 
shove, we have no doubt that the carriers would win, and we believe AMT knows that.  
Cellular phone service is a utility, and particularly given that most carriers in AMT’s 
markets are struggling, consumers and governments recognize that if costs are high,

consumers will end up paying out of their pockets.  As a foreign company with little 
political clout, AMT has to be very careful about threatening to take carrier equipment 
off the towers – few of its host governments would tolerate disruption of a public utility 
for the sake of AMT’s profits. 
 


How Prevalent is Lending? 
 
To illustrate how much of AMT’s international business consists of financing revenue 
(i.e. return of principal and interest), the below graphs by region of carrier sale and 
leaseback transactions make several points clear.   
 





 
Note: This graph excludes the Site Sharing acquisition. 


 
In Latin America, it appears as though the tower steel is generally worth approximately 
US$100,000 in more recent transactions.  Previously that number was about $50,000.  It 
appears as though at least five to six of the 12 to 13 carrier sale and leasebacks are 
financing deals,55 based on the premium over tower steel book values.  This observation 
is based on the assumptions that co-location rent revenue is not significant due to a 
combination of low tenancy ratios on the acquired towers and monthly rent rates that are 
much lower than those of the US.  Thus, we assume that transactions in which intangible 
assets approach (or exceed) 100% of the PP&E value are lending transactions.  
Depending on how diligently AMT allocates its intangible assets, significant goodwill 
and customer relationship intangibles might also be signs of lending transactions.

It appears as at least one of AMT’s three purchases in Africa could be a lending 
transaction, based on intangible assets to PP&E.  This transaction would be the Cell C 
sale and leaseback announced in November 2010. 
 


Lending Business’s Effect on EBITDA 
 
We conservatively estimate that a total of US$162 million of EBITDA is coming from 
such over market contracts (on average).  The present value of above market contracts is 
US$728 million based on our projections of tenant churn and utilizing a 10-year 
remaining life on the respective contracts.  Our analysis is subject to change based on 
changes in assumptions on churn, and length of contracts, among other factors. 
 


Potentially Adverse Tax Treatment due to Booking Principal Repayments as 
Revenue 
 
AMT can experience adverse tax consequences because it books the loan repayments as 
rental revenue.  (In contrast, banks only book interest payments as revenue.)  Avoiding 
net negative tax consequences requires a degree of care in structuring these transactions 
that we do not believe is generally present in AMT’s international acquisitions.  AMT’s 
use of a slightly rosy assumption about co-location lease ups could cause AMT to ignore 
the tax implications of treating principal repayment as revenue. 
 
AMT will owe income taxes on the principal repayments, if it is not able to depreciate or 
amortize an asset over a period of time no greater than that of the leaseback agreement.

• In Brazil, the entire tower asset would likely be recorded as PP&E (unless AMT 


is acquiring a concession, rather than fee simple ownership of the tower).  A new 
tower is depreciated over 25 years, and a used tower is depreciated either over 
half of its useful new life (i.e. 12.5 years) or over the residual of its useful life.  
Brazil therefore could provide for a serious mismatch between revenue and 
offsetting expenses.  Income is taxed at 25% for the corporate income tax and an 
additional 9% for the social contribution tax. 


• In Mexico, AMT may depreciate its tangible assets over 10 years, meaning that it 
is likely able to fully offset the income tax effect.  The corporate income tax in 
Mexico is currently 30%, but will be 29% in 2014 and 28% in 2015.   





Conclusion 
 
AMT’s de facto international lending business serves to mislead investors about AMT’s 
overseas profitability, while incentivizing AMT to enter into even more such transactions 
in order to feed the beast.  As we detail infra, AMT’s international business is often 
destroying value, and in some cases earning returns lower than those of local government 
bonds and usually below the required return for the market.  The de facto lending 
business exacerbates these problems. 


AMT’S INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS IS PART CARRY TRADE AND 
PART LEVERED DIRECTIONAL CURRENCY BET. 
 
AMT’s international business is also effectively part emerging / frontier market carry 
trade, and part levered directional currency bet.  AMT is largely funding in the US by 
borrowing US$8.85 billion, which is up from US$3.5 billion in 2002.  It invests this 
capital in streams of fixed cash flows in high interest rate countries.56  The high local 
interest rates are the primary determinants of AMT’s local IRRs.  (Problematically, AMT 
is generally underperforming local government bonds.)  
 
A standard carry trade is dependent on the foreign currency not depreciating (whether or 
not due to hedging).  As we discuss next, AMT is un-hedged and is earning its carry in 
volatile (and generally greatly depreciated) currencies.57  Beyond the currency risk, 
AMT’s business model layers on top significant risk, including counterparty risk and 
execution risk (i.e., inability to match performance to its models).  AMT’s international 
returns certainly do not compensate investors for the risks of these carry trades in 
emerging and frontier markets. As we note supra, AMT’s executive compensation targets 
are adjusted for currency fluctuations. 
 
	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
56 Germany is an exception to this, but we estimate AMT’s IRR in Germany at only 4.0%. 
57 AMT has US$427 million of local currency debt, which is approximately only 10% of its international 
balance long-lived assets.  It announced a multi-currency credit facility on July 1, 2013; however, because 
the rates are based on LIBOR rates, the facility

It is crucial for investors to understand that AMT does not hedge its currency exposure, 
which puts its investments and cash flows at risk.  AMT states that it does not hedge its 
currency exposure because hedges for these currencies are expensive.  We estimate that 
AMT has exposure to emerging and frontier market currencies of approximately US$4.2 
billion, or 36% of its long-lived asset base.  The chart below shows the performance since 
2010 of four of the EM currencies to which AMT has directional exposure, the Brazilian 
Real, Indian Rupee, Ghana Cedis, and the South African Rand – a hedge fund using 
leverage for this trade would have been unhappy.

It is clear from the table above that it is expensive to hedge all the currencies in which 
AMT does business, except for the EUR.  However, the hedging costs are functions of 
currency volatility.  The more expensive it is to hedge a given currency, the more likely it 
is that currency movements will impact asset valuations.  This is one more reason why 
the perception that AMT’s cash flow is stable is incorrect. 
 
AMT has a small amount of local currency debt that is a very partial offset to its 
exposures.  It has US$144 million in Colombia, out of US$351.8 million invested; and, 
US$90 million in South Africa, out of US$249.5 million invested.  On July 1, 2013, 
AMT announced that it had entered into a multi-currency credit facility with rates linked 
to LIBOR rates.  This facility appears not to hedge AMT’s currency exposures, save for 
that to EUR.  There are no LIBOR rates for any of AMT’s other currencies (beside 
dollars).  
 
AMT’s use of inflation-linked escalators in its overseas businesses is a poor hedge 
against currency fluctuations.  Further, we believe that AMT’s business in its largest 
overseas market by towers, India, operates with fixed escalators, rather than those linked 
to CPI.  Even though market practice in Brazil is to use inflation-linked escalators, 
AMT’s average rents have been dropping year-over-year since 2008, despite the country 
generally experiencing inflation approximating 6%. 
 
CPI escalators are poor substitutes for currency hedges because the movements are not 
highly inversely correlated.  This year, Brazil’s official CPI has been 6.2%.  However, 
the Brazilian Real has weakened 9.8%.  South Africa’s CPI has been 5.8% YTD, yet the 
Rand has weakened to 16.3%. In India, the relationship has actually been more direct, 
with CPI at 9.3% and the Rupee only weakening 9.1% YTD. 
 
Currencies do not necessarily move in an inverse correlation to inflation.  Currency 
movements are relative to one another, while CPI measures inflation in one market.  
(Albeit currency movements affect inflation and vice-versa.)  The factors determining the 
relative demand for currencies are highly complex, and beyond the scope of this report.  
Suffice to say, AMT largely funds in US dollars, AMT’s shareholders buy and sell 
AMT’s shares in US dollars, and receive dividends from AMT in US dollars.  CPI 
escalators overseas do not hedge these risks. 
 
AMT is likely not using inflation-linked escalators in India, which is its largest 
international market by towers and accounts for 32.9% of AMT’s international tower 
base.59  According to a competitor of AMT and an India-based analyst who covers 
another competitor, Bharti Infratel (BHIN:IN), it would be unusual for a tower operator 
to have inflation-linked escalators; rather, contracts usually provide fixed escalators of 
approximately 3%.  India’s CPI rose at 8.9% and 9.3% in 2011 and 2012, respectively.  
To the best of these individuals’ knowledge, AMT utilizes fixed escalators.  Our 
calculations below confirm our thesis that AMT is not using inflation-linked escalators in 
India.

Even though AMT should be using inflation-linked escalators in Brazil, which accounts 
for 13.8% of AMT’s international tower base, its average rents are declining in local 
currency terms.  Our calculations below illustrate the paradox. 
 





POOR INTERNATIONAL IRR AND NECESSARY IMPAIRMENTS 
 
Overstated International Growth and Value Destruction 
 


 
 
Much of the value that is associated with AMT arises from the excitement over ATL’s 
growth compared to other REITs. With growth in the US tower market slowing, the 
market is expecting the double digit growth to be coming from ATL’s international 
subsidiaries. We have investigated a number of ATL’s international operations and 
instead of finding double digit growth we found disappointing markets with significant 
headwinds, risks and overpriced acquisitions leading to substantial value destruction. 
This section will specifically address the issues in India, Brazil, Germany, and Ghana and 
demonstrate that AMT has destroyed at least US$1 billion of shareholder value.

We estimate that international entities generate a consolidated segment EBITDA of 
US$482 million as of the latest twelve month period ending March 31, 2013.  The market 
multiple for the Company as a whole is 21x EBITDA.  Our analysis shows the market 
trends, revenue growth, profitability, return on investment, and risk factors do not support 
anywhere near a 21x EBITDA multiple for the international business.  The cash flow 
generating capacity is just not there, and we caution “don’t believe everything you hear 
from management.” 
 


India	
  
 
“Relative to India, you have to be careful about what you read out of all the press and all 
the things that are going on in India. But stepping back, we view, as we've always viewed 
India, is a very, very important market, a market that fits nicely within a diversified 
portfolio in American Tower.” 	
  
Tom Bartlett,  ATL, CFO, EVP American Tower Corp at REITWeek®: NAREIT's 
Investor Forum Chicago June 6, 2013 	
  
 
“Only US investors would buy [Bharti Infratel, an Indian tower company going public] 
at this price.” 
Indian Telecom Analyst 
 
Mr. Bartlett is referring to the 2011 crisis and its aftermath in the Indian telecom industry. 
The revelations of the 2G scandal in 2011 brought deep uncertainty to the market, which 
was further rocked by the Supreme Court quashing 122 of the spectrum licenses. 
Vodafone’s bitter tax dispute with the Indian government also highlights the regulatory 
risk in India. Adding fuel to the fire, our sources have told us that the Indian government 
realized that it could raise more money by selling licenses to a large number of carriers, 
which has brought about intense competition to the telecom market. The pressure has 
been passed down to the tower companies, where AMT is now the only foreign player 
left in India.   
 
Nevertheless, despite all this news, India is seen by both management and analysts as a 
high growth market for ATL. As we discuss in the report, AMT is valued at such a high 
multiple due to the growth prospects of the international portfolio as the US growth is 
limited.
‘Page 33 of 118	
  


Company and Street estimates for the international portfolio are far too optimistic and it 
appears there is a significant disconnect between how these international markets are 
viewed from the US and how they are seen by locals, India being a prime example of 
this. This disconnect can even be seen by the stock price performance of Bharti Infratel 
(BHIN:IN), a pure play Indian tower company,  since its IPO in December 2012.  BHIN 
IPO’d at INR220 but it is now trading at INR157.05, a fall of 28.6%.  Local analysts 
strongly believed at the time that the stock was well overpriced because US investors 
pushed the IPO value up on the assumption that the Indian tower market would replicate 
the US tower market’s performance.  As is the case with AMT, US investors mistakenly 
assumed the tower model can flourish elsewhere without understanding the local issues.  
 
We also fundamentally disagree with Mr. Bartlett’s assertion that shareholders “have to 
be careful about what you read out of all the press and all the things that are going on in 
India”. We have performed deep due diligence in India and have found a market with 
significant head winds and regulatory uncertainty that will have a substantial impact on 
ATL’s future operations on the market. Shareholders should not take managements’ 
word, but should instead read and evaluate all the information in the local press and come 
to their own conclusions. 
 
Marten Pieters, MD & CEO of Vodafone India, said recently in an interview with The 
Times of India regarding the telecom market in India – “The worst is over for this 
industry. That doesn't mean that we are there and the future is rosy”.60 Mr. Pieters was 
referring to the carriers, however, based on the issues below it appears that the problems 
for the smaller tower companies are just starting. 
 
Revenue Growth is Not What It Seems and Is Well Below CPI 
 
ATL’s problems in India arose from its very first steps in the country. The contract 
escalators it negotiated with the telecom carriers were set at 3%, compared to CPI of 9%. 
At the time, AMT had hoped that the perceived substantial growth in the market would 
offset the loss from inflation, however, this growth never materialized. 


 
The revenue growth is also not what it seems. Approximately 35% of total India revenue 
is reimbursements from carriers for energy costs, this has been grossed up in the AMT 
10-Ks. AMT’s local accounts only show net revenue.  This revenue has no impact on the 
bottom line at all, however, it does assist AMT in masking its revenue growth because 
these reimbursements are growing at CPI well above the rent escalators of 3%. While 
shareholders might be seeing a significant growth in revenue, little of it is hitting the 
bottom line. 


 
India revenue increased from US$171 million in 2011 to US$182 million in 2012, an 
increase of only 6.5% which is far below the double digit growth that analysts were 
expecting. As per the above points we believe that some of this growth was in fact a 
growth in pass through revenue and did not hit the bottom line.

from-other-countries-marten-pieters-vodafone-india/articleshow/21060585.cms
‘Page 34 of 118	
  


 
The insubstantial rent escalators are also causing ATL’s margins to be squeezed because 
they are growing at CPI or higher, for example we understand from local sources that 
wages are growing at 15% per annum and there are significant security costs for many of 
the greenfield sites which are rising with every new tower build.  
 
Currency risk 
 
The below graph depicts the performance of the Indian Rupee against the US Dollar since 
AMT started investing in India. As can be seen the INR has deprecated significantly 
against the US Dollar and highlights the risk of investing in foreign jurisdictions without 
hedging the currency exchange which AMT has not.  





Whilst AMT has not taken an impairment of its intangible assets, there was nevertheless 
a decrease in long-lived assets in its Indian subsidiaries from US$807 million in 2010 to 
US$671 million in 2011,61 which may have been caused by currency fluctuations.  
 
As AMT has not hedged its currency risk we believe that this could cause further 
devaluation of revenue and assets in the future and will most likely lead to AMT 
performing below expectations. 
 
Competitive Pressures Limit Growth 


 
Indus Towers, the largest tower company in India, is a joint venture between India’s three 
largest carriers Bharti Airtel, Vodafone and Idea Cellular; and, is 42% owned by Bharti 
Infratel. Indus has first option on building new towers for each of these carriers. We 
believe that Indus will take up this option unless the tower is economically unviable, and 
this will limit AMT’s growth in new tower builds, or at least AMT will find that its

anchor tenants will be the smaller carriers with higher counterparty risk. With Indus and 
Bharti Infratel having substantial access to the three largest carriers (62% market share) it 
means that smaller tower companies, such as AMT, may be more reliant on smaller 
operators that have greater counterparty risk. 


 
We understand from local industry sources that there is talk the tower companies may 
also face increased competition from power transmission operators, such as Power Grid 
Corporation of India Limited, which might let its existing infrastructure be utilized by 
wireless telecommunications service providers for installation of their active 
telecommunications equipment. 


 
Another issue facing smaller tower companies is the lack of stringent zoning laws in 
India.  Tower companies are free to build towers close to a competitor’s tower, which has 
led to a large number of towers being situated in close proximity to each other. As a 
result, the carrier has stronger pricing power as it can move towers without a material 
effect on its network. Additionally, one can see a number of towers that have no tenants. 
We understand that some of these are AMT towers. 


 
There are also significant rent abatements in India, that come into effect when an 
additional tenant co-locates to a tower. We understand that a carrier can save up to 15% if 
there is one other tenant on the tower and this discount will increase with any additional 
tenants. This means that even when additional tenants co-locate to an AMT tower, there 
is a heavy discount on the rent, and revenue growth is not linear with tenant growth. 
  
We understand from Bharti Infratel’s management that it offers additional discounts on 
top of this rent abatement in order to attract more tenants.  We do not believe that ATL, 
with only 10,000 towers, can compete with Bharti and Indus, which own approximately 
150,000 towers between them.  


 
Regulatory issues 


 
The Indian Department of Telecommunications is expected to impose an annual 8% of 
revenue license fee on tower operators.62 In our discussion with local lawyers we 
understand that the fee is currently in abeyance and a date for its introduction is yet to be 
set. Nevertheless, this license fee is another cost that tower companies are going to be 
facing which they cannot pass on to customers. 


 
Tower companies including American Tower have recently been given notice by the 
National Green Tribunal that its towers may have been constructed in violation of 
stipulated guidelines.63 We understand from local lawyers that due to the gravity of the 
allegations and potential health hazard, the Tribunal has directed that there should be no 
construction of towers without following the mandatory provisions of law, and without

obtaining necessary permission from the competent authority. The hearings are currently 
in process and we are not able to assess the potential impact, however, this could be 
significant if the Tribunal require towers to be pulled down. 


 
The Indian government has recently approved the Telecom Regulatory Authority of 
India’s recent suggestions to reduce the carbon footprint of the telecom sector by 
mandating the reduction of dependence on diesel.64 We understand from local sources 
that Indus is expecting that it will cost INR1 million per 5KW tower to come in line with 
government expectations. Based on this and assuming that AMT have a 50:50 split 
between rural and urban towers, we believe that the India operation will have additional 
capital expenditures of approximately $128m over the next ten years. It should be noted 
that this expenditure will not improve ATL’s margins as energy costs are all passed 
through to carriers who will solely benefit from this expenditure. 


 
Carrier Effects on Growth and Pricing 


 
Carriers are suffering from margin squeezes and have been looking to decrease the rents 
they pay on towers. We have heard from a number of local industry experts that the rents 
in some of the contracts coming up for renegotiation are as low as half of what they use 
to be pre the 2011 crisis. This has not come through in ATL’s revenue yet as leases have 
not come up for renewal yet but once they do they will find significant pressures on rental 
prices received. 


 
Our local sources also insisted that cost saving pressures coming from carriers is one of 
the main threats facing tower companies in India. From 2007 to 2012, ARPUs in India 
have fallen at a 13% CAGR and there has been intense competition in a market that is 
oversaturated with carriers. These sources have informed us, that to combat falling 
margins carriers are starting to pressure tower companies to cut the costs that are passed 
through to them, fuel being the main component. We understand that carriers are willing 
to move equipment from their current towers to any tower that offers the greatest cost 
savings. In order to retain their tenants, tower companies will be forced to invest 
significant capital expenditure to achieve the required cost savings. Unfortunately for 
shareholders, these large expenditures will have little if any benefit on ATL’s margins. 


 
The smaller tower companies, including ATL, had been hoping to benefit from Reliance 
Industries’ 4G roll out on their towers, however, Reliance has recently made a deal with 
Reliance Communications to collocate on their towers only to the exclusion of any other 
tower company.65

idINDEE95603P20130607
‘Page 37 of 118	
  


 
We also understand that Reliance will be paying INR15k per month compared to AMT 
and Bharti Infratel’s INR30-35k per month, which demonstrates the effect of pricing 
pressure. 66 


 
It does not appear that the 3G roll out has had any substantial impact on revenues as has 
been the case with Bharti Infratel’s revenue per tenant per tower and as such we believe 
that the 3G roll out is unlikely to provide any significant benefit to ATL. 67  The high cost 
of using 3G data has seen a slower uptake than expected and this could also impact the 
4G roll out.68 If carriers decide to lower rates in order to increase the 3G take up then this 
could lead them to further squeeze tower companies. Some analysts also believe that the 
slowdown in the subscriber numbers and maturity of the 2G segment have put a question 
mark on some of the growth assumptions.69 


 
The Indian government sold license to too many carriers for the market size which has 
led to fierce competition with a number of carriers being loss making. As such it is 
expected that there will be further consolidation of carriers in the market, which will 
impact the number of tenants and could have a disproportionate effect on the smaller 
tower companies such as ATL. 
 
Turn for the Worst 
 
The tower market in Indian is in the worst shape in years.  The market peaked in late 
2010 / early 2011 and since then the market for tower companies has collapsed. We 
understand from India media sources that a local tower operator called TowerVision, 
which has a comparable portfolio to ATL, has been up for sale for some time with only 
AMT appearing to be a potential buyer.70  Based on a recent article, AMT value the 
transaction at US$50,000 to US$58,000 per tower,71 which compares to tower values of 
US$100,000 to US$120,000 at the peak of the market before 2011. This shows how far 
the market has fallen and indicates that ATL’s portfolio is also not as valuable as it once 
expected to become. Our industry contacts advise us that few tower operators are willing 
to pay up for Indian towers given the poor market conditions and increasing operating 
risks.

Threat of Low-Cost Towers 
 
Low cost towers may change the dynamics of the industry even further. Reliance 
Industries are said to have developed a tower that would cost merely US$2,000 and 
Chinese companies are said to have developed a tower to be used in India for 
US$10,000.72 This may put further pressure on tower operators to reduce prices and 
costs. 
 
Value Destruction 
 
As a result of the above, we performed a calculation to assess ATL’s investments in the 
country.  We estimate that AMT has made acquisitions totaling US$763 million and 
those investments are now worth US$399 million.  We believe the market conditions and 
the outlook for ATL’s business prospects will remain very weak and that AMT should be 
forced to impair its intangible assets and/or goodwill in India by US$364 million, or 48% 
of the combined acquisition prices . We project that ATL’s existing Indian investments 
will only generate an IRR of 7% which is equivalent to the Indian government bonds 
yield at 7%, and are rated BBB with negative outlook. 
 
We use a WACC of 15.5% India, and an exit multiple of 10x EBITDA.  Such discount 
rates might sound high to US investors, but, again, the Indian government 10-year bond 
yield is 7%, and inflation is at 9%.  The volatility of the India equity market is also high 
at 20%.    Equity market volatility is the potential percentage change in the price 
movement in the stock market index (up and down) and is somewhat of a proxy for the 
myriad risks a Western company takes when entering an emerging market. 
 
The table below summarizes the results of our analysis.  


 
 
Our View ATL’s Operations in India 
 
There appears to be a disconnect between how US investors are seeing growth in India 
and how local analysts view this and this is demonstrated by the Bharti Infratel stock 
performance. In light of all the reasons stated above, we believe that AMT face 
significant obstacles to its growth in revenue and EBITDA and a cash drain from further 
capital expenditure which will provide no benefit to the margins. We believe that at best, 
AMT will achieve a 6% CAGR in EBITDA which is hardly the growth driver that the

market is looking for in India and this includes the benefits  of the additional capital 
expenditures that are unlikely to provide a meaningful return to shareholders. As per Mr. 
Martens quote above, the worst is over for Indian carriers, however, based on research, 
we have found that expectations on the ground in India are far below the lofty 
expectations in Boston.  
 


Brazil	
  
 
"The strategy among our leadership team at the moment is to sort of consolidate and 
integrate and heavy up in the countries that we are at today. And so in Brazil, for 
example, Hal and his team accomplished 600 plus Tower acquisition. Grew the portfolio 
by over 1/3 in a country that we are already in this year"  
Jim Taiclet, JPMorgan Technology, Media and Telecom Conference 16-May-11  
 
We believe that AMT has placed such an extreme emphasis on growth that they went for 
quantity over quality and this is evident in acquisitions such as Vivo in 2012. AMT are 
also guilty of using flawed models to justify other acquisitions, as in the case of the Site 
Sharing acquisition in 2011. These mistakes have led AMT to overstating growth and 
destroying shareholder value in Brazil. ATL’s Brazil is really just a story of two 
acquisitions. 
 
Site Sharing 
 
Aside from the mystery of "the missing $250 million" discussed supra, we believe this 
acquisition is plagued with further issues, which will hamper further growth. From our 
discussions with local industry sources with firsthand knowledge of this transaction, 
AMT were far from happy with the outcome of this transaction but attempted to only 
show the positives to investors.  
 
Growth Based on Unsustainable Cash Flows 
 
The Site Sharing sites were leased to Oi and TIM at well above market rates, we have 
been informed by local sources that these were as high as 2.0x to 3.0x over market rents. 
It is unclear why these towers were at such a premium. However we understand that the 
deal was made between Site Sharing and Oi and TIM to build these towers on which they 
would be the only tenants and in return Site Sharing would be given disproportionately 
high rents. This most certainly benefited Site Sharing management when they sold it on 
to AMT for 12 to 13x cash flow. We believe this higher than market rents are 
contributing US$66 million to EBITDA. 
 
Unfortunately for shareholders, these cash flows are unsustainable.  We understand that 
on the acquisition of these sites there was only an average three to five years left on many 
of the leases. We understand from sources close to the transaction that these carriers are 
already strongly pushing to renegotiate their rent even prior to the termination of the 
contract. Oi and Tim are using their network size as leverage to bring down the cost of 
the Site Sharing portfolio in line with market rent.
‘Page 40 of 118	
  


 
Market rent abatements will mean that any additional tenants on the Site Sharing towers 
may not add any discernible revenue growth. Firstly, a new tenant would most definitely 
not be paying the over market rent that Oi or TIM are, otherwise they would find a 
different tower. A working example would be, if the anchor tenant was paying US$5,000 
and a new tenant was added paying US$2,000, then the anchor tenants rent would be 
reduced to US$3,500, so the additional tenant is adding little growth. We should also note 
that it would take at least five years for a new tenant to be added on to every tower.  
 
Based on the problematic Site Sharing portfolio, we believe that the above market rent 
that AMT is currently receiving, which amounts to 43% of operating revenue, is 
unsustainable and any average rent metrics based off this will be overstated.  
 
Infrastructure Sharing Is a Threat To Growth 
 
Earlier this year, four of Brazil's largest carriers announced infrastructure sharing 
agreements, which could severely impact the future growth of tower companies in 
Brazil73.  
 
Oi and TIM announced their agreement to share infrastructure (towers and equipment) 
for LTE networks in the 2.5 GHz spectrum band deployments. The move was approved 
earlier this year, on April 19, 2013, by ANATEL, The Brazilian Telecommunications 
Authority. ANATEL voted to allow Oi and TIM to share towers, transmission equipment 
and broadcast stations. ANATEL further stressed that its intention is to reduce costs for 
carriers so that benefits can feed through to the consumer.74 
 
Vivo and Claro announced in March of this year that they had signed a memorandum of 
understanding to share telecom infrastructure, such as cell sites, backbone and backhaul 
and even their 3G networks. CADE, Brazil antitrust regulator, has already approved 
this agreement75.  
 
Infrastructure sharing is expected to become an increasing trend and focal point for 
carriers across Latin America which are looking to deal with falling average revenues per 
user76 (“ARPU”) by cutting network costs.  
  
We have discussed this issue with multiple local industry sources, including ATL’s 
competitors and local tower infrastructure contractors and we are confident that this trend 
poses a major threat to tower companies in Brazil. Infrastructure sharing will hinder 
expected growth and hamper any expectation to benefit from the rollup of new networks.

With the new technology enabling antennas to handle multiple carriers signals this threat 
is now a reality. 
 
Poor Acquisitions Mean That Growth Will Require Significant Additional CapEx 
 
We understand from local sources that the poor condition and quality of the 1,692 towers 
acquired in the 2012 Vivo acquisitions, will require AMT to invest substantial capital 
expenditure to strengthen the towers so that they can add more tenants. From our due 
diligence of this acquisition,  we suspect that these towers were largely older towers that 
were constructed in the early stages of Brazil’s tower deployment, with a large 
percentage of these towers not having a permit (we note this a wider spread problem in 
Brazil), and many not even having site plans, which would have made it extremely 
difficult for AMT to determine whether the towers are able to support any additional 
tenants and plan their CapEx accordingly. Without this most basic information, AMT is 
having hard time signing new contracts with collocating tenants, without knowing which 
towers can actually support colocation. Thus, we believe this supports what heard from 
sources we deem reliable that AMT is not satisfied with this acquisition, having modeled 
it based on estimations that are not materializing. The post-acquisition work on each 
tower to assess it structural strength will also delay tenancy growth. 
 
Based on local knowledge we gathered, we estimate that the redevelopment of these sites 
will cost US$30,000 to US$40,000 per tower.  If only 50% of the Vivo towers are 
ultimately redeveloped to handle more than one tenant per tower, the result would be an 
additional capital expenditure of US$31 million.  Our expectation is that a larger number 
of the Brazilian towers will need to be redeveloped in order to add more tenants to towers 
and that the total cost will be approximately US$100 million.  If alternative energy 
regulations are implemented and/or carriers push more of the total cost of operating a 
tower onto tower companies, additional capital expenditures would be needed to remain 
competitive. 
 
Currency Risk 
 
The Brazilian Real has depreciated significantly against the US Dollar since AMT 
accelerated its  investments in Brazil.  The BRL has deprecated by over 30% in the last 2 
years, and 12% in the last 3 months. By not hedging the currency, AMT have taken a 
substantial currency risk on shareholders’ returns, and if indeed AMT benefited from the 
carry trade when it first entered the Brazilian market, it is no longer the case and we 
expect these devalued revenues to have an impact on ATL’s revenues going forward.
‘Page 42 of 118	
  


 
Value Destruction 
 
As a result of the above, we performed a calculation to assess ATL’s investments in the 
country.  We estimate that AMT has made acquisitions totaling US$988 million and 
those investments are now worth US$713 million.  The material overpayment for the 
Brazil assets relative to their profitability and risks lead us to believe that AMT should be 
forced to impair its intangible assets and/or goodwill by US$274 million, or 28% of the 
combined amounts paid for acquisitions. We project that ATL’s existing Brazil 
investments will only generate an IRR of 11%.  Brazil government bonds yield 11%, and 
are rated BBB with a negative outlook.  
 
We use a WACC of 17.5% for Brazil,  and an exit multiple of 8.0x EBITDA.  Such 
discount rates might sound high to US investors, but the Brazilian government 10-year 
bond yield is 11%, and inflation is at 6% .  The volatility of the Brazilian equity market is 
one of the highest in the world at 20%. Equity market volatility is the potential 
percentage change in the price movement in the stock market index (up and down) and is 
somewhat of a proxy for the myriad risks a Western company takes when entering an 
emerging market.
‘Page 43 of 118	
  


 
Our View of ATL’s Operations in Brazil 
 
AMT have shown little regard for shareholder value when investing in the Brazilian 
market, its two main investments appear to be classic cases of knee jerk acquisitions with 
no regard to potential risks and minimal due diligence. We are not surprised to hear from 
local sources that AMT are looking to potentially acquire a Brazil and Mexico tower 
portfolio from NII Holdings (NASDAQ: NIHD). Our industry contacts have advised us 
that few tower operators are willing to take credit risk on NIHD at anywhere near the 
current asking price. With substantial head winds from infrastructure sharing and carriers 
looking to cut costs, we do not believe that AMT should be gambling any more money in 
the market place based on their poor track record. 
 


Ghana	
  
 
Growth Ceiling 
 
We understand both from sources operating in Ghana and from an AT Kearny article on 
Tower Xchange77 that the tower companies in Ghana and Africa in general should only 
expect to achieve a maximum of two tenants per tower. 


 
This contention is based on the following: 


 
a. In Ghana there are three main carriers, AMT have a deal with the largest, 


MTN whilst the other two have deals with Eaton Towers and Helios 
Towers, which means there is less chance of collocation. 
 


b. We also understand that new tower companies are entering the Ghana 
market which is increasing competition and will lead to further dilution of 
tenants and potentially reducing prices of any additional tenants. 


 
c. We have also heard that all future expansion in Ghana is likely to be rural 


which will require extensive capital expenditure and will require the 
operation of linking towers in order to increase coverage and few tenants 
per tower. 


 
As a sale and leaseback transaction, the rent paid by MTN to AMT is above the market 
rent that AMT would receive from non-anchor tenants and so any additional tenants will 
be paying lower rent. 


 
Loss Making 
 
At this point in time, the Ghana joint venture is loss making. We understand from the 
MTN conference call that this loss is below the EBITDA line, nevertheless, after

investing in a US$517.7 million joint venture it is surprising that it is loss making. 
 
Cash Drain 


 
We understand from industry experts in Ghana that a significant amount of capital 
expenditure is required in Ghana. Whilst, they did not have direct information regarding 
ATL/MTN joint venture in Ghana, they have looked at newer tower portfolios and have 
found that at least 25% of towers built by local carriers were only strong enough for one 
carrier, another 15% needed refurbishment and a further 10% needed to be fully replaced. 
We believe that as the MTN’s tower portfolio is older, it is likely to minimally require 
this amount of capital expenditure. 
 
This raises questions over the level of due diligence that AMT have put into assessing 
their acquisitions, at a significant cost to shareholders. This cash drain also raises 
questions over the value of the transaction itself. 
 
Purchase Price Anomalies 


 
On December 6, 2010 AMT had entered into a definitive agreement with MTN in Ghana 
to form a joint venture to buy 1,876 towers for approximately $430m. Once the final 
tranche of towers were transferred on December 23, 2011, the joint venture paid $518m 
for 1,856 towers. No reason has been provided for the increase in purchase price. 


 
In MTN’s 2011 accounts, it seems that ATL’s share of the cost remained at US$219 
million but this only 42% of the final purchase price, it should be noted that the amount 
AMT paid does not appear in MTN’s 2012 accounts.  


 
This anomaly raises a number of questions, not least as to what is the true value of the 
assets? Why would MTN sell AMT 51% of the assets for just 42% of the value, it does 
not appear that they were desperate to do so as there would have been other bidders? 
Could this mean that the assets are overstated? 
 
Value Destruction  
 
As a result of the above, we performed a calculation to assess ATL’s investments in the 
country.  We estimate that AMT has made acquisitions totaling US$518 million and 
those investments are now worth US$246 million.  We believe the market conditions and 
the outlook for ATL’s business prospects in Ghana are uncertain given the extremely 
high inflation in the country, high government bond yields, high business risk and 
questionable joint venture structure.  Given the decline in value relative to the amount 
paid for acquisitions, we believe that AMT should be forced to impair its intangible 
assets and/or goodwill by US$272 million, or by 53% of the original acquisition price. 
 
We project that ATL’s existing Ghanaian investment will only generate an IRR of 11%.  
Ghanaian government bonds yield 17 %, and are rated B. We use a WACC of 25% in 
Ghana, and an exit multiple of 6.0x EBITDA.  Such discount rates might sound high to
‘Page 45 of 118	
  


US investors, but, again, the Ghana, again, the government 10-yeaer bond yield is 17 %, 
and inflation is at 11%.  The Ghana market is also very illiquid and the capital markets 
are still emerging. 
 


 
 
Our View ATL’s operations in Ghana 
 
The Ghanaian investment appears to be overvalued particularly when compared to their 
discounted cash flow model valuation and the unjustified increased purchase price. 
Unfortunately, the acquisition is another example of AMT not performing enough due 
diligence, at the outset it should have had a better handle on the purchase price and given 
guidance on the amount of capital expenditure that was require in order to increase its 
tenancy ratio. 
 


Germany	
  
 
AMT bought 2,031 towers in the end of 2012 from KPN/E-Plus for $500m, KPN have 
since claimed that these towers are not core assets. KPN’s 2012 financial statements seem 
to indicate the parties have signed a 15 year lease. E-Plus, the tenant on the towers, is the 
third largest mobile operator in Germany with a market share of 21% and is owned by 
Dutch KPN, which is considered a player in the low cost end of the cellular market.  
 
The German wireless market is saturated with a penetration rate of 140% for 3G and 47% 
for 4G. Germany has about 35,000 site locations with 70,000 base stations, ATL’s 
acquisition represents about 5.7% of the total German market. 
 
The sale by KPN was the first tower sale in Germany. Historically all the towers were 
owned by Telekom and when the market opened up for competition in the 1990’s other 
operators started to build their own towers, however, a significant proportion of tower 
space is leased from Telekom. E-Plus, as discounter, chose to build its own towers to 
save on the rental payments and we understand that they might have prioritized cost over 
quality. 
 
Low Growth Market  
 
We also understand from local sources that there is little collocation demand for rural 
towers in Germany as all operators have complete coverage and E-Plus is not deploying 
LTE in rural areas. As such and based on our discussions with local experts, there is very
‘Page 46 of 118	
  


limited growth for AMT in Germany. 
 
Threats of Carrier Consolidation  
 
A major risk for AMT is the possibility of a merger between E-Plus and Telefónica. This 
merger has been rumored many times before and KPN has also tried to sell E-Plus to 
raise funds to fight a takeover attempt by Carlos Slim.78 We note that there are other 
examples of KPN and Telefónica working together such as a network sharing pilot in the 
Netherlands.79  
 
A merger might happen in order to save on costs80 and would likely need to the 
decommissioning of sites as both companies have coverage of all of Germany and both 
companies use the same technology.  
 
Value Destruction 
 
As a result of the above, we performed a calculation to assess ATL’s investments in the 
country.  We estimate that AMT has made acquisitions totaling US$526 million and 
those investments are now worth US$419 million.  We believe the market conditions and 
the outlook for ATL’s business prospects in Germany are weak with increasing risks 
from carrier consolidation, a low quality tower portfolio, and stagnant new tenant growth 
prospects.  Given the decline in value relative to the amount paid for acquisitions, we 
believe that AMT should be forced to impair its intangible assets and/or goodwill by 
US$107 million, or by 20% of the original acquisition price.  We project that ATL’s 
existing German investments will only generate an IRR of 4%.  German government 
bonds yield 2%, and are rated AAA with stable outlook. We use a WACC of 7% in 
Germany , and an exit multiple of 14.0x EBITDA.

Our View of ATL’s Operations in Germany 
 
ATL’s assets in rural Germany have low growth prospects but yet there is a risk of carrier 
consolidation. There does not appear to be any apparent reason for this acquisition and it 
appears to be expansion for expansion sake. 


CELLULAR TOWERS ARE SOON TO BECOME THE MOST 
EXPENSIVE OPTION OF LAST RESORT; THE HALCYON DAYS 
ARE OVER. 
 
Fiber and Cell Towers: Is History Repeating Itself? 
 
In 1998, investors were bullish on fiber optic cable owners, because internet traffic was 
projected to grow 15x over the next five years.81  At the time, investors were drawn to the 
logical conclusion that a major increase in traffic meant the need for an equal amount of 
new fiber optic cable.   
 
Internet traffic met those expectations, but demand for fiber barely grew because 
improved laser transmission and copper-bonding technologies increased the data capacity 
of a single strand of fiber to the point where it and existing distribution could absorb the 
increase in demand without much need for additional fiber. 
 
A similar phenomenon is happening right now in the tower industry. AMT is scouring the 
globe, purchasing tower assets from other operators. Given the projected increase in 
global demand for mobile data, investors are lauding its efforts.82 But are towers the only 
way to relieve the congestion of global data traffic. Just as in the past, there are other 
technologies out there that can increase capacity of the existing tower network, including 
Wi-Fi, smart cells, sectorization, antenna tilting, and improvements in spectrum 
efficiency and spectrum sharing. Investors seeking to profit from data demand growth by 
owning AMT will be disappointed. 
 
Wireless History and Development 
 
The ideas used to develop the wireless network were adapted from traditional telephony. 
The equipment carriers developed included analog, mechanical devices meant to 
interface with the traditional analog public switched telephone network (PSTN). One of 
these strategies developed including overlaying a honeycomb shaped grid over a map of 
the region in which the carrier was implementing service. They placed a transmission 
tower at the center of each ‘cell’ in the grid, hence the term ‘cellular’. These towers 
relayed mobile user’s signals as the user travelled from one transmission area to another.

Since carriers built and operated their own networks, radio frequency engineers had 
precise information about their network’s capabilities and performance. Because the 
carrier controlled all aspects of their private network, these systems were termed 
Homogeneous networks.   
	
  


	
  
	
  
	
  
Carriers building private networks used electromagnetic spectrum purchased from 
government auctions to replace the copper wires of a fixed network.  Once their private 
networks were complete, carriers began offering consumers access by selling packages of 
voice minutes, and eventually access to SMS and data access packages.  The 
Telecommunications Act of 1996 introduced a new regulatory scheme where entrants 
could pay wholesale prices to access carrier networks. This legislation, in conjunction 
with the FCC final ruling on Docket 1650983 concerning private access to AT&T’s 
network, eliminated the carrier’s competitive advantage of a private network. Carriers 
responded by divesting themselves of assets, including through sale and leaseback of 
towers, and marketing arrangements with third party companies such as tower marketing 
companies. These transactions provided carriers with added liquidity and allowed them to 
focus on their core business.  Tower companies could market the towers to other carriers 
looking to expand or improve communications at a lower cost than carriers would pay to 
develop those assets themselves. Additional tenants greatly improved the economics for 
tower companies, giving them strong rents and margins. 
 
Carriers have since begun to invest in a next-generation network based on modern 
technology. This new network is digital, uses open communication protocols (Internet 
Protocol (IP)), and is designed for metro-based data consumption. These new 
‘heterogeneous’ networks are ad-hoc and unplanned compared to the first generation, but 
they succeed where it matters: they can meet consumer data demand.

Growing Data Demand Will Largely Bypass AMT 
 
The AMT bull case is that data demand is surging and AMT will benefit. However, the 
next generation data delivery network is here already, and makes towers optional and 
comparatively expensive. Wi-Fi data delivery already greatly exceeds cellular data 
delivery, and a new generation of equipment, network sharing, government regulation, 
and competitors will combine to marginalize tower operators, leaving their networks as 
the highest cost data delivery option of last resort. 
 
Myopic AMT Management Does Not Grasp the Challenges Ahead 
 
AMT CEO James Taiclet stated in 2012 that “95% of our towers are outside of urban and 
near-urban environments”.84 In its June 2013 overview, AMT stated it is "well positioned 
to capture incremental demand from network densification as a result of the rapid growth 
in wireless data consumption."85 However, only 10% of cell sites (including macro 
towers) handle almost 90% of cellular data traffic.86 We question how AMT’s towers can 
be positioned to capture incremental growth when, according to their President, CEO, 
and Chairman, the vast majority of their towers are not located where the people 
generating the increased demand are.  
 
Carrier Upgrade Completions Will Reduce AMT Amendment Revenue 
 
AMT generates revenue from its tower network by charging carriers rents. AMT charges 
for the amount of equipment carriers place on the tower, and for changes to the 
equipment already on the tower, a fee known as “amendments”. In the US, the tower 
industry has already captured much of the growth it will see from high-speed data 
network build outs; therefore, amendments will generate much less revenue than they 
have in recent years. Verizon’s (VZ) CEO has said that Verizon is 95% done with its 4G 
upgrades. AT&T (T), the other large domestic carrier, is midway through a 3-year 
upgrade announced in 2012.

Technology and network sharing will reduce amendment revenue 


 
 
Industry observers note that the development of wireless communications usually occurs 
in two phases. During the first “coverage” phase, carriers seek to establish a minimal 
amount of coverage in their service areas. This coverage is often described as “a mile 
wide and an inch deep”. During this phase of development, carriers are reluctant to share 
any network component, because coverage can be a product differentiator. During the 
second “capacity” phase, carriers focus on expanding the data delivery capacity of their 
networks and seek out opportunities to reduce costs by sharing some or all of their 
network.   
 
AMT vs. The Cloud 
 
The second “network densification” stage is focused on adding data delivery capacity and 
will largely bypass towers to a significant extent. Tower operators’ ability to generate 
amendment revenue by charging the same carrier for multiple generations of equipment 
on the same tower will decrease as new generation equipment with greater capabilities 
replaces older equipment, and carriers can remove old equipment from the towers. For 
example, equipment today is built with multiple chipsets to handle various voice and data 
technologies. This reduces the need for additional equipment, and allows carriers to 
consolidate by sharing network equipment, which is the next logical evolution of tower 
sharing. As software becomes more embedded in the network infrastructure, upgrades
‘Page 52 of 118	
  


and configuration changes will be handled via the “cloud” at the software and firmware 
level, and carriers will not have to replace equipment as often. 
Technological advancements reduce AMT’s tower utility  
 
JDS Uniphase estimates that network capacity can be increased by 1,000 times in the 
next ten years without adding much equipment to macro towers through a multiplier 
effect of adding spectrum, carrying voice over LTE (VoLTE), and relying on small cells. 
If carriers’ spectrum increases by three times, then LTE can multiply the spectral 
efficiency by another six times, and small cells can increase the spatial efficiency by 56x, 
creating a total gain of 1,000x.87 This gain can be achieved without much reliance on 
towers. 
 
We believe that Wi-Fi will increase the spectrum availability by more than three times 
and this combination of technologies greatly threatens rents of the towers themselves.  
 
Wi-Fi is a Grave Threat to AMT’s Business Model 
 
By nature of its ubiquity, improving Quality of Service (QoS), and very low total cost of 
ownership (TCO), Wi-Fi represents the single biggest threat to the tower industry. It is a 
mature technology with widespread adoption and as the Cisco VNI data meter shows, it 
is already used to deliver more data worldwide than the cellular network. Approximately 
80% of data traffic is from indoor users.88 As a communications technology, Wi-Fi has 
several major advantages over traditional cellular. First, and perhaps most important, Wi-
Fi is near-free for the carriers and it is unlicensed, meaning carriers can use it without 
having to pay license fees in the billions of dollars, and there is no authority to grant, 
revoke permission or regulate its usage.

Wi-Fi presently delivers more smartphone data than cellular. We direct interested readers 
to the Cisco VNI data meter website for additional regional and tablet data consumption 
graphs: http://www.ciscovni.com/data-meter/index.html. 
 
In addition to being free, Wi-Fi can deliver significantly more data than 4G. Depending 
on configuration, the recent version of Wi-Fi, “802.11ac” has a theoretical peak rate of 
1.3 GBPS while the 4G theoretical peak rate is 1 GBPS. Realistically speaking, radio 
interference, distance to antennae, ground speed, backhaul constraints and other factors 
limit both 4G and Wi-Fi, resulting in 4G data delivery rates in the 10-16 MBPS range and 
Wi-Fi delivery in the 331 MBPS89, an advantage of twenty times.

It is difficult to overstate the threat Wi-Fi and small cell pose to AMT’s economic model. 
Wi-Fi gives carriers and consumers a low cost alternative to the current mobile economic 
model. Although carriers have millions of subscribers, their margins are thin and eroding 
(as we explain in Carriers Under Pressure infra). This erosion is accelerated when 
subscribers switch to smart phones, because smart phone users generate an enormous 
amount of data traffic on the carrier’s private network. The carrier absorbs the cost of 
supporting this traffic.  
 
These costs provide a powerful incentive to the carrier to find alternative delivery 
networks, and they in turn encourage consumers to offload to a free network (i.e. Wi-Fi) 
for their data as soon as possible. Carriers have incentivized consumers by eliminating 
unlimited data plans and charging consumers for the data delivered. Consumers naturally 
prefer a free, faster, unmetered service more so than a paid, slower, metered service and 
respond to the incentive by getting off of the private carrier network and onto the free 
Wi-Fi network whenever possible.  
 
Carriers such as SK, Orange, and T-Mobile facilitate the transition to the Wi-Fi network 
by implementing SIM-based authentication, a technique that retains user-device 
information after the initial login so that so that users are ‘auto-magically’ logged in

again when they are in range of the network. 90 91 Smart phones simplify the process by 
notifying customers whenever they are in range of a free or previously accessed network.  
Carriers that originally invested in towers to support their network are now investing in 
Wi-Fi and small cells. To that end, AT&T now offers over 20,000 hotspots to its mobile 
subscribers and there are no usage fees.92  Boingo (WIFI) claims a global network of over 
700,000 hotspots available to consumers for US$8 per month.93 The next evolutionary 
step will be integration of Wi-Fi access and the core cellular networks.  


 
Additional technical developments include remote tilting antennas to minimize 
interference which have “the most direct impact on coverage and interference 
parameters”.94 A technique called “transrating” can reduce cellular network bandwidth 
requirements for streaming video by 30% to 50%.95  Local content caching is enabling 
carriers to manage video traffic better by enabling them to store high demand video (e.g., 
viral YouTube videos) at central locations, or cache video at the small cell itself.   
 
AMT would like investors to believe it is positioned to significantly benefit from the 
growth in data demand.  If AMT investors expect 15-20% growth they will be 
disappointed.  Wi-Fi traffic already exceeds cellular traffic. As technology evolves, 
cellular tower industry growth will slow considerably. We believe that tower companies’ 
halcyon days of 74%gross margins from US carriers are numbered. 96 We expect that 
few, if any, international markets will ever offer tower companies the economics that 
have been generated in the US.  (As we explain supra, ATL’s international gross margins 
are artificially inflated by its de facto lending business.)   
 
AMT is at a dangerous crossroads in its business: its customers’ margins are 
compressing, yet carriers have ample room on the balance sheet to invest in the high 
value, low cost alternatives being offered by existing vendors, as well as by newly-
formed companies. The data delivered over these alternate delivery routes already 
exceeds the data delivered on the cellular network, and their continued development and 
growth will leave AMT as the highest cost option of last resort going forward.  
 
Small Cells 
 
First generation radios were analog, bulky and could typically perform only a single 
function. Radios are now embedded with integrated circuits, making them more similar to 
modern computers than their predecessors. LightRadio (pictured below) is part of a new 
generation of palm-sized Wi-Fi equipment manufactured by Alcatel-Lucent (NYSE: 
ALU) that puts 2G, 3G, 4G and Wi-Fi functionality into a single antennae with its own 
base station equivalent hardware and software. It is inexpensive and small enough to

These devices are power efficient and can handle multiple spectrums simultaneously, 
enabling carriers to share network equipment – the next step in an evolution that began 
with sharing towers. Small cells are designed for, and excel at providing inexpensive 
additional capacity in metro areas. In metro areas carriers have advantages not available 
on towers such as access to previously built public infrastructure, including electrical 
power and data backhaul on fixed line networks, often controlled by the carriers. 
 
Multifunction small cell manufacturing is a growing industry segment. Others producing 
similar equipment include traditional manufacturers such as Ericsson, Nokia Siemens, 
Cisco, and Texas Instruments and young guns such as BelAir Networks, Ruckus 
Wireless, IP.Access, and SpiderCloud. Carriers deploying small cells include Verizon97 
and AT&T98 
 
In November 2012, the number of small cells deployed surpassed the number of macro 
cells deployed since inception, with an estimated 6.0 million small cells, compared to 5.9 
million macro cells.99 Small cells are cheap to buy, easy to deploy and offer carriers a 
high value mechanism to bring data access to data consumers in metro areas. Carriers and 
consumers are incentivized to use them because the data delivery cost and total cost of 
ownership (TCO) is lower than macro cells.

Network Sharing Is Caring 
 
Carriers have long understood if they could share infrastructure, they can reduce 
operating expense and increase profitability, which was the impetus for divesting tower 
assets in the first place. AMT may have sown the seeds of its own destruction with the 
initial success of its business model. Carriers are loath to allow tower companies to 
continue to reap outsize margins when theirs are compressing. Technology now makes it 
possible for carriers to share as much of their network as they want, and is swinging the 
balance of power back to carriers. Foreign governments in some of AMTs markets, such 
as Brazil and Colombia, are legislating network sharing because it maximizes scarce 
resources, minimizes environmental degradation, saves fuel, and is more efficient 
economically.   
 
Equipment sharing is a natural evolution from sharing towers.

A combination of carrier need and technological advances are enabling carriers to greatly 
consolidate their tower-based network equipment, share network equipment with one 
another (the next logical step after sharing towers), circumvent towers altogether through 
the use of small cells and Wi-Fi, and increase data capacity by one thousand times with 
minimal additional use of cell towers.

If You Can’t Beat ‘em, Join ‘em 
	
  
Carriers have begun to realize that they cannot service the data demands of their 
customers over cellular networks and have taken a “if you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em” 
approach. They have already begun deploying and promoting Wi-Fi networks as an 
alternative.  For example, AT&T and the NYC mayor’s office are collaborating to deliver 
free AT&T branded Wi-Fi to 26 parks around the five boroughs. Cities now offering free 
Wi-Fi stretch from Silicon Valley to Ponca City, Oklahoma to Ocean City, Maryland.101  
 
Carrier Checkbook Fatigue: Data Demand Creates Systemic Problems 
 


 
  Source: Unstring Insider: Feb, 2007 


 
The problem facing carriers is systemic: revenue growth is outpaced by the cost of 
delivering data and is increasing as smartphones and tablets penetrate the market. 
Competitive pressure and consumer contracts are revenue constraints that prevent carriers 
from raising rates to cover the increased cost of delivering data, thereby forcing the 
carrier to find alternative lower cost data delivery methods.

Carriers are responding by deleveraging and raising cash by selling underperforming 
assets, such as cell towers at emerging market bubble prices to willing buyers, such as 
AMT.  These deals usually take the form of sale and leaseback transactions wherein 
AMT purchases the towers from the carrier and the carrier agrees to pay rents to AMT for 
the length of the contract. The section of this report detailing AMT’s SiteSharing deal 
supra takes a look under the hood at such transactions. 
 
 
IP Based Softphones Threaten Carriers and Towers 
 
Softphones are software versions of phones. They have a telephone number, can make 
and receive calls, they have voicemail, and they can send and receive SMS messages. 
The main difference between a softphone and a standard phone is that a softphone is 
designed to run on VOIP (voice over internet protocol), a standard that is supported on 
any current device that can connect to the internet. Softphone pricing plans are a fraction 
of traditional mobile phone plans, and can be as low as $99 per year. Consumers living in 
cities with free Wi-Fi, or who have Wi-Fi at home and work, can skip the traditional 
cellular network altogether, circumventing the carriers (and AMT) in the process. As 
discussed infra in section Cable and Softphones Aligning to Offer Consumers a Cheaper 
Alternative, cable companies are creating alliances to promote Wi-Fi based softphone 
use. 
 
The softphone industry is large enough to threaten AMT. Microsoft Corp (Nasdaq: 
MSFT) spent $US 8.5 billion to acquire Skype in 2011102, and Vonage is a popular 
service. Google Voice is a free app offered by Google. A cursory look at the Google Play 
store reveals at least 45 other softphone applications. 
 
Spectrum: Why Buy the Cow When You Can Get the Milk For Free 
 
When carriers built the first generation of private wireless communication networks, they 
relied on governments to provide adequate spectrum to meet their needs. Governments

met the need by conducting auctions. In the US, those auctions lasted as many as 276 
rounds and resulted in fees as high as US 18.9 billion for a single band of spectrum.103 
This time around carriers have the luxury of being able to pick and choose from a variety 
of technologies that reduce their dependence on paid spectrum, while simultaneously 
increasing their ability to deliver increasing amounts of data to consumers.  
 
In some countries, such as Peru carriers are not paying the governments for spectrum 
they agreed to buy.104 In India, the government appears to have difficulties deciding on 
what spectrum allocation regime they want to implement after their recent allocation 
scandals, and in Brazil, as well as other countries including the US, the government 
mandates carriers provide coverage in unprofitable rural areas.105  


 
Carriers, sovereigns, and citizen consumers all desire ubiquitous, affordable high-speed 
mobile communications at the lowest cost possible. Wi-Fi enables this goal and the 
proliferation of Wi-Fi will continue to expose towers as the high cost data delivery option 
of last resort. 
 
If you Can Beat ‘Em, Beat ‘Em 
 
AMT’s margins are too attractive to go unnoticed. Aside from carriers looking to reduce 
their dependence on towers, cable companies have now set their sights on the tower 
industry and are leveraging their ‘Last mile’ advantage.  
 
A recent June 2013 Jeffries report estimates that cable operators actually carry more 
consumer wireless data on their networks than mobile carriers, yet cable generates $0 
directly attributable revenue from wireless. Jeffries also notes that the CableWiFi 
confederation has tripled its hotspot count to more than 150,000, from 50,000 in the 12 
months since the initiative launched, that technologies are being developed to facilitate 
authentication between contiguous hotspots for mobile users, and that all network gear 
being deployed today is enabled with this technology including devices such as the 
Samsung Galaxy S4. Jefferies expects all smartphones going forward to have the 
technology. 106 
 
Cable and Softphones Aligning to Offer Consumers a Cheaper Alternative 
 
Five cable companies including Cablevision, Comcast, Time Warner Cable, Cox 
Communications and Bright House Network founded the CableWiFi Alliance in May 
2012 to promote free outside-the-home Wi-Fi service to coalition customers. This will be 
accomplished by replacing existing home cable modems with a new free modem, which 
will broadcast two signals.

specific use of the customer while the other signal will broadcast and open, unsecured 
guest signal to be used by passersby.  
 
One of the primary intended uses of this free neighborhood network is support for a 
branded softphone application,107 Voice2Go, that would enable its customers to make 
free web-based phone calls and send SMS messages without it counting against their 
wireless account. 108 Since the network is Wi-Fi based, consumers can use other VOIP 
softphone apps such as Skype (acquired by MSFT in 2011 for $USD 8.5 billion), 
Vonage, or Google Voice. This development could significantly reduce the need for 
cellular or broadband data transmitted between macro cells, particularly in densely 
populated areas.  
 
VZ and SpectrumCo are awaiting FCC approval for Verizon’s purchase of 122 spectrum 
licenses for US 3.6 billion. Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA) CFO Michael Angelakis 
framed the move during the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference, “We 
don’t have to invest in building a wireless network. We aren’t going to acquire a wireless 
network. It’s quite a significant transaction. If you’re a Comcast customer, this means 
that you will eventually be able to purchase cable television, Internet service, home 
phone service, and cell phone service, all through your cable company." 109 If this sale is 
approved, investors may see a global wave of similar deals, all of which are bad for the 
tower industry and AMT investors. 
 
Wi-Fi is a free public technology that empowers competitors who seek to develop low 
cost high availability networks. Wi-Fi is a global threat to the private cellular network 
that AMT provides infrastructure for. AMT’s customers are collaborating with AMT’s 
competitors and using new technology to develop data delivery networks that reduce their 
TCO. AMT is myopic if they think that carriers and cable companies are going to allow 
them to keep generating fat margins without a fight.  


IMPEDIMENTS SPECIFIC TO US GROWTH 
 
We do not have a sanguine view of AMT’s US growth prospects, despite acknowledging 
that Americans are going to be using increasing amounts of data in coming years.  
Carriers will be focusing their network densification in areas in which AMT has 
relatively few towers.  AMT is also facing increasing cost pressure.  The ground rents 
under many of its sites are likely to double or triple in coming years.  AMT has been slow 
to react, and has instead directed its investments to often poorly-conceived emerging and 
frontier market investments.

Increasing Ground Rents and the “TriStar Effect” 
 
AMT has not been forthcoming about its exposure to ground rent increases, which we 
expect to materially impact AMT’s margins.  Most alarmingly, but in an opacity typical 
of AMT, it has not disclosed in its filings the litigation between it and TriStar Investors, 
Inc. (“TriStar”); nor, has AMT disclosed that because TriStar has gained control of the 
ground beneath over 650 of AMT’s higher yielding towers, AMT is likely faced with a 
choice to buy TriStar (likely for at least US$400 million to US$500 million) or lose 
annual revenue purported to be approximately US$77 million.110  Even though AMT 
expects to spend approximately $100 million per year going forward, it still leaves itself 
exposed to the problem.   
 
Many of the cellular towers have ground leases that are coming up for renewal in the 
coming years.  Typically ground leases gave tower owners (or their assignees) rights of 
up to 20, 25, or 30 years.   
 
When ground leases come up for renewal, landowners typically have significant amounts 
of leverage over AMT.  AMT does not actually own the tower steel for a significant 
portion of its portfolio – namely the towers it leases from Verizon (NYSE: VZ) and 
AT&T (NYSE: T).  The lease agreements for these portfolios, which cover at least 4,250 
of its towers (approximately 20% of the US portfolio),111 provide that if AMT is unable 
to renew a ground lease, then it loses it lease on the tower.   
 
Even in situations in which AMT owns the tower, the typical landowner has a substantial 
amount of leverage over the Company.  The cost to decommission and re-assemble a 
tower elsewhere generally runs 50% to 100% of the cost of a new tower, and must be 
incurred upfront.  Zoning restrictions are significant barriers to moving towers in many 
locations.  The zoning environment is far less permissive than it was when the towers 
were originally constructed – particularly due to concerns about landscape clutter and 
health concerns.  (As we discuss infra, even developing countries such as Chile, Peru, and 
Brazil are imposing tight zoning restrictions and even forcing AMT to move towers for 
health protection purposes.)  The other issue for AMT in trying to move towers is that it 
plays havoc with the carriers’ network coverage.  Carriers create coverage maps that 
attempt to minimize dead zones in between towers, but without causing them to spend 
inefficiently.   
 
AMT’s landlords are much more sophisticated than they used to be, and ever increasing 
numbers of them are seeking a greater share of the economic pie.  Over the past 15 years, 
the total cash flow from a typical tower has grown by more than 400%,112 while the 
typical landlord has seen its share of the tower cash flow fall from approximately 40% to 
less than 15%.113  The market for ground leases is becoming far more efficient than it 
used to be, caused in part by the ubiquity of cellular communications and the ability of

the internet to deliver market information.  There are numerous ground lease consulting 
firms and attorneys helping landlords renegotiate their leases on more favorable terms.  
Often these consultants receive a portion of the new economics, incentivizing them to be 
solid advocates for their clients when dealing with tower operators.   
 
We therefore conservatively expect AMT’s US ground rents to increase 4.5% annually 
for the next ten years, despite AMT’s expected spending of US$100 million per year 
buying easements or long-term lease renewals.  


THE REIT THAT CAN’T DO IT RIGHT – INTERNATIONAL AFFO 
IS INACCESSIBLE TO AMT SHAREHOLDERS 
 
We do not believe AMT’s international business is compatible with its REIT structure.  
There are numerous tax barriers to AMT paying dividends to shareholders from its 
international cash flows.  The myriad risks to these cash flows are incompatible with 
REIT investors’ desires for steady, predictable dividends.  Our impression is that REIT 
investors generally expect the underlying assets to hold their value, if not appreciate; 
however, towers have limited useable lives.  We view AMT’s conversion to a REIT as an 
attempt to ride a REIT bubble and produce a stock pop that will prove to be a short-term 
gain. We also wonder to what extend AMT could be out of compliance due to the site 
sharing discrepancy. 
 
Because AMT is doing business in various overseas jurisdictions, its international cash 
flows will effectively be inaccessible to AMT investors.  The main issue is that many of 
these jurisdictions impose substantial taxes on transfers of profits out of the country.  
There are of course ways to minimize the taxes, but taxes can still be substantial.  We 
researched statutory taxes that could be issues for AMT in attempting to repatriate profits 
to the US.  AMT’s structuring is extremely complex, and it is impossible for us to know 
the actual rates that will apply to it.  As a case in point, AMT has a SOFOM in Mexico – 
SOFOMs are non-bank lending institutions.  In any event, our research gives investors an 
idea of the issues associated with repatriating profits. 
 
In general, AMT has three ways of expatriating profits from its overseas operations.  
AMT can lend money from its offshore parent to its onshore operation, and make 
principal and interest payments to the parent.  AMT appears to have structured a number 
of parent loans between its Netherlands entities and its onshore operating companies.  
AMT can also charge its onshore companies for management services and intellectual 
property (i.e. trademarks) usage.  Finally, AMT’s entities can pay dividends to their 
parents. 
 
Interest payments on loans from parents can be deductible to the onshore subsidiary, but 
the interest charges are often subject to “transfer pricing” limitations, i.e., AMT cannot 
charge itself usurious interest rates.  There is also usually a country-specified limitation 
on how much debt its operating entities may incur.  Regardless, interest payments from
‘Page 63 of 118	
  


the onshore subsidiary to the parent are often subject to “withholding” tax.114  The 
following highlights some of the withholding taxes that could be applicable to interest 
and dividend payments to AMT’s parent companies from the operating entities. 
 


• In Mexico, withholding taxes on interest payments range from 4.9% to 40%.  
There are no withholding taxes on dividends. 


• In Colombia, withholding taxes on interest paid to foreign entities can range from 
14% to 33%.  Dividends to offshore shareholders are generally taxed at 25% to 
33%.  


• In Ghana, withholding taxes on interest paid is 10%.  The withholding tax on 
dividends to offshore shareholders is 15%. 


• In Germany, there is no withholding tax on interest.  Dividends to US 
shareholders are generally taxed at a total rate of 26.375%.  (We do not have the 
rate applicable to Dutch shareholders.) 


• In South Africa, there are no withholding taxes on interest.  The withholding tax 
on dividends is 15%, but can be recoverable under certain circumstances. 


• In India, withholding taxes on interest payments are generally 20%.115  There is 
no dividend withholding tax. 


• In Uganda, interest paid to foreign lenders is taxed at 15%.  Dividends are also 
taxed at 15%. 


 
At the risk of this report seeming to be a love letter to Jay Brown, we quote him 
regarding the incompatibility of the REIT structure with the risks of emerging and 
frontier market cash flows:116 
 


Brett Feldman, Deutsche Bank – Analyst: “Does that have anything to do with, as 
you noted, you see being a REIT as kind of the end game?  Do you feel like as a 
REIT you would be better off not having that exposure to international markets or 
particularly to emerging markets?  Is that part of it in terms of thinking about how 
investors will value your cash flows?” 
 
Jay Brown, Crown Castle International - SVP & CFO: “It is.  I think the point in 
time in which we are paying a dividend, I think our dividend payment will look 
very much like a bond payment. In essence you have got secured cash flows 
under long-term leases from very high-grade tenants in the US business…Today 
the public market doesn't seem to make a valuation difference between cash flows 
that are bought in a developing country or Verizon Wireless.  My own view and 
our firm view is that there is a big difference in terms of the credit quality of those 
cash flows, the sustainability of those cash flows, and predictability of those cash 
flows.” 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
114 Many foreign jurisdictions impose “withholding” taxes on interest and dividends, which are not 
refundable.  Thus “withholding” usually has a different meaning in international jurisdictions’ tax law than 
it does in the US. 
115 There is a 5% rate that can apply, but only to borrowings on or after July 1, 2012.

Traditional REITs generally invest in real estate assets that generally hold their values,117 
if not appreciate; however, many of AMT’s assets generally have usable lives of about 25 
years, if properly maintained.  We understand that properly maintained cellular towers 
will last 20 to 25 years in the cases of lattice and guyed towers, and 35 to 40 years in the 
case of monopoles.  During their useful lives, cellular towers will require maintenance 
cap ex that is a much higher percentage of their construction costs than is the case for 
traditional real estate assets.  Without land ownership, there is no terminal value of the 
asset.  We therefore suspect that many REIT investors who own AMT are unfamiliar 
with some of these dynamics. 


AMERICAN JAMES AND THE TOWER OF DOOM (AND OTHER 
TALES OF VALUE DESTRUCTION IN EMERGING MARKETS). 
 


“Urgh.” – former AMT executive when asked about AMT’s India investments. 
 


“We think there are a lot of risks associated with the emerging markets that are not 
maybe necessarily completely appreciated. The US has a fantastic environment of 
very high barriers to entry that we haven't seen in other countries. And then, as we 
think about some of the things like currency risk and taxes and the ultimate ability to 
take cash flow and distribute it out to the shareholders longer term, those become 
hurdles for us to get over in order to make an investment outside of the US.” – Jay 
Brown, Chief Financial Officer, Crown Castle International Corp.118	
  
 


Well said, Mr. Brown. 
 
AMT is destroying billions of investor dollars through its international (ad)ventures.  
This section is a discussion of both AMT’s practices and why the markets in which it is 
committing hundreds of millions of dollars at a time require care and diligence. 
 
AMT’s transaction-focused compensation has undoubtedly contributed to AMT putting 
the pedal to the metal – simultaneously growing by 8.0x, or approximately 27,800 towers 
in nine emerging and frontier markets in four years.  At the time that AMT stepped on the 
gas, it was doing only US$1.6 billion in revenue per year.  AMT did not have the 
infrastructure, processes, culture, and discipline necessary to simultaneously tackle nine 
emerging and frontier markets, making nine-figure investments at a clip. 
 
This frenzied pace of emerging and frontier market investment has translated into some 
surprisingly lax business practices.  For one, we believe that AMT’s typical on site due 
diligence is to only visit about 10% of the towers it plans to acquire.  Many of the towers 
in these markets lack structural and engineering documentation – engineers often lack the 
confidence in their work to keep permanent records.  The problem is that towers in

emerging / frontier markets are often built to widely varying standards, and thus have 
varying useable lives.  Further, some transactions in these markets turn out to require 
significant CapEx in order to extend their lives or permit colocations.  We suspect that 
this slapdash approach to due diligence has cost AMT some model-busting CapEx.  
 
AMT’s frequent and significant changes of its purchase price allocations supports our 
observation that it does not do much (i.e. sufficient) on site due diligence before closing 
acquisitions.  The below shows some of the larger changes AMT has recorded.

AMT exhibits a casual attitude toward its investments, seemingly feeling investments are 
justified because they are made at lower price to EBITDA multiples than its EV / 
EBITDA multiple.  While making such “accretive” investments appears to comport with 
business school teachings, it becomes highly problematic in the real world (i.e., dynamic 
market prices) with companies that trade at outsize multiples, such as AMT.  The issue of 
course with AMT using its own outsize multiple as a benchmark for acquisitions is that 
its outsize multiple implies AMT can grow rapidly and use its capital efficiently.  At the 
prices AMT is paying, it is using its capital inefficiently (i.e., often generating lower 
returns than local government bond yields – see Poor International IRR and Necessary 
Impairments), making its own multiple unsustainable and eventually putting its multiple 
inside of the multiples it has been paying for its acquisitions.  
 
AMT is putting good assumptions into its models in deciding how much to pay for a 
given portfolio.  This strikes us as a significant concern given the presence of a) AMT’s 
deal-centric culture and compensation, b) its low funding costs (which can encourage 
poor capital allocation decisions), c) domestic market headwinds, and d) the difficulty of 
operating in each of its emerging and frontier markets, let alone making forecasts 
regarding these markets. 
 
One example of how rushed AMT can be in acquiring towers is a December 2010 
transaction with Telefónica in Mexico.  The period approaching the holidays is an 
unusual time of year in Mexico to move quickly on a deal – most business greatly slows 
down at that time.  Yet, we have heard that this deal was proposed and agreed to in a very 
short time – possibly several days.  Telefónica apparently was going to sell the towers to 
another buyer, but became concerned that it would not close the deal by its goal of 
December 31st.  Industry sources stated that Telefónica then contacted AMT and offered
‘Page 67 of 118	
  


the towers if AMT could close quickly.  AMT did.  Mexico is typical of AMT’s pedal to 
the metal style. 
 


Mexico: An Amigo in Need is an Amigo Indeed – Sale and Leasebacks with 
Distressed Telecoms 
 
Grupo Iusacell is one of AMT’s first forays into emerging market sale and leasebacks, 
and  up until 2008 was the Company’s largest international customer.119  As opposed to 
being a case study in success, it has proved to be a case study in under-appreciated 
market risk in would-be opportunistic acquisitions.   
 
Grupo Iusacell was financially weak when AMT entered into a sale and leaseback 
transaction in 2002-2004 for US$30.6 million and 137 towers.120  Its weakness was 
reported publicly in 2004, should have been evident to management when they entered 
into the transaction,121 and did not improve after the liquidity injection.  Instead Grupo 
Iusacell twice filed for “Concurso Mercantil,” a restructuring similar to U.S. Chapter 11 
bankruptcy.   The first filing came in 2006,122 the same year as the closing of the sale and 
leaseback.  Grupo Iusacell returned to file for “Concurso Mercantil” again in 2010.123  
This time the situation was more serious.   
 
By the end of 2009, AMT’s net accounts receivable related to Grupo Iusacell stood at 
$28.2 million,124 and one Iusacell subsidiary had discontinued debt service payments.125   
In 2010, AMT and Grupo Iusacell negotiated new lease terms, which resulted in lease 
cancellations,126 restructuring of A/R into a five-year note, and redenomination of the 
transaction currency from dollars to pesos.127  The aggregate impact of the restructuring 
to AMT was a loss of US $33.6 million “of certain non-monetary assets and 
liabilities.”128  Despite such initiatives, Grupo Iusacell nearly entered formal bankruptcy 
in 2011 and was considered close to going under entirely.129  Despite having received a 
massive investment from a new investor in 2012, it may be again falling behind on its 
repayments of the debt restructured in 2010.130

AMT’s recent acquisition of 883 towers from Axtel for US$248.5 million is a much 
larger deal, but one which might be poised for a repeat.131  In Mexico, where market rents 
are generally close to US$1,000 per month per site or sometimes even much lower,132 
Axtel reports that is will be paying approximately US$1,888/month per site (US$20 
million per year).133  These premium rate payments add up, and like other poor-credit, 
cash strapped pay-day borrowers, the burden of the new obligations weighs on their 
ability to meet obligations and return to financial health.  As Fitch pointed out in its 
recent rating of Axtel, “although the sale and leaseback of the towers improved their 
liquidity, their lease adjusted leverage remains essentially the same.”134  While Axtel’s 
credit rating escaped from “C” to “BB-“, the real risk remained largely unchanged, or 
may have been partially off-loaded to its new creditor, AMT. 
 
These above market rates might be great for AMT's top-line and the acquisitions can 
show as being immediately accretive, but they come with risks that the average REIT 
investor probably fails to appreciate.  In the event of a default or a buyout by a larger 
competitor, the potential acquirers are few, and most are existing, large customers such as 
American Movil or Telefónica.  This creates consolidation risk wherein the buyer of the 
company will have significant leverage to renegotiate rents to the real market rate or may 
simply chose to decommission the equipment to reduce redundancy or “network 
overlap.” Either of these actions would transform an opportunistic accretive transaction 
into an under-performing or non-performing asset.   
 
There are reports of an imminent sale and lease back transaction of approximately 4,500 
towers in Mexico and Brazil that belong to financially distressed NII (NIHD).135   In 
April of 2013, NII’s CEO reported being close to a deal.136  Multiple industry insiders 
and analysts believe that AMT is the leading candidate for this portfolio.  In the event 
that NII and AMT Management were to work out terms for this deal, we believe that that 
there would be a significant consolidation risk, wherein premium above market rents that 
AMT often charges in exchange for a large cash purchase price would likely be rejected 
by an acquirer of NII.  Because of these issues, and the questionable overlapping audit 
committee chair with NIHD along with prior transaction discrepancies, we strongly

If Murphy (the optimist) met Heraclitus the Greek philosopher to discuss EM investment 
strategies, the two would certainly have a lively conversation.  The ongoing Greek debt 
crisis, revolutions in the Middle East, massive street protests in Brazil, multitude of 
multi-national scandals, and general boom and bust cycle of many emerging markets 
which have roiled markets is a reminder of their combined wisdom.  
 
In this volatile environment, emerging market investors need to remain vigilant to avoid a 
myriad of pitfalls.  The capricious nature of emerging market governments alone carry 
considerable political and regulatory risks and can impact the fortunes of Company’s and 
their investors seemingly at whim.  Management would like shareholders to believe that 
you can transplant a business model from the US into emerging markets and expect to hit 
a home run; however, emerging market economies are unpredictable and the diversity of 
the local political and sociological conditions in the Asian, African, and Latin American 
markets American Tower has chosen to enter each provide their own unique challenges 
which must be carefully managed.  Economic instability or inequality can quickly foment 
social unrest, turning a seemingly stable or high-growth market into a volatile 
environment with significant negative externalities that drag upon economies for years, 
impacting corporate profits, especially at foreign owned enterprises.    
 
Our review of the emerging markets which American Tower has entered (India, Ghana, 
Uganda, South Africa, Brazil, Mexico, Columbia, Chile, Peru) has revealed a multitude 
of operational risks with strong potential to negatively impact the Company’s long-term 
performance.  Some of the key risks along with links to articles or resources are provided 
below.  This is by no means an exhaustive list.  We hope that shareholders, and especially 
REIT investors unfamiliar with EM investments, will research the political, economic, 
legal, and regulatory environments in which AMT has chosen to operate and consider the 
caliber of management required to effectively manage risk and deliver sustainable value. 
 
Capricious	
  Regulators	
  
 
AMT is at risk of tower expropriation in Colombia.  In other case, governments might 
require AMT to relocate or decommission towers, incurring significant expenses. 
 
Claro and Telefónica Movistar’s twenty-year concessions will come to an end in March, 
2014.  Colombia’s “Contraloria,” a governmental comptroller charged with oversight of 
publically owned goods and assets, is asserting these concessions were awarded under a 
legal regime in place at the time of the contracts’ execution which obligated the carriers 
to return to the State all infrastructure, including not just the spectrum but also the towers 
and antennas at the end of the period.  While a 1998 law came onto the books which 
provided that only the spectrum itself would be returned, the Contraloria maintains that it
‘Page 70 of 118	
  


applies only to subsequent build outs, and does not affect the infrastructure already in 
existence.   At issue for AMT is the fate of 500 towers purchased from Telefónica 
Moviles Colombia for approximately US$72.8 million.  The “Contraloría General” 
(Comptroller Genera) has declared its intention to be vigilant and require the return of the 
infrastructure when the concessions are completed. The contentious case has become 
politicized, and is to be submitted to the Constitutional Court for a decision.137 
 
Bharti Airtel, India’s largest carrier and a customer of AMT, has sought Telecom 
Minister Kapil Sibal’s intervention on a penalty of Rs 650 crore (approx. US$100 
million) being imposed on the company by the Department of Telecom. The penalty is 
being imposed for offering long-distance services that allowed users to avoid national 
roaming charges.  By routing the call in Mumbai itself, Airtel bypassed the long distance 
network, which caused a revenue loss to the Government in the form of lower license 
fees from the long distance operations.  Barhti’s CEO expressed his extreme dismay 
reporting that, “The regulator found this service to be customer friendly and in 
compliance to the license conditions. While our service had passed the test of the 
regulator, the DoT is reportedly likely to impose penalty on us without any opportunity of 
personal hearing.”  Barhti’s CEO received no communication from the DoT on this case 
for over eight years and feared that the company would face a huge handicap if the 
penalty was imposed at this stage.138  


In the past few years, new laws in India, Brazil, Chile, and Colombia established set 
backs for cell phone towers from public buildings such as hospitals, clinics, schools, 
kindergartens and nursing homes, and in some areas regulate the number of towers or the 
heights of the towers to be constructed.139  The 2012 Chilean law was to be applied 
retroactively and requires telecom and tower operators to remove towers from sensitive 
areas. The Chilean regulations also provide that a carrier or towerco might be able to 
keep some towers in place or exceed maximum height restrictions if it agreed to 
compensate the local community with payments valued at 30% of the build cost of the 
towers.  American Tower made partial disclosure of this problem in its 2012 10-K, but 
only upon further inquiry from the SEC, revealed that 18 towers had already been 
identified as in violation and which may need to be fully impaired in the future.140    


More recently in Colombia, a ruling made by the Supreme Court required a tower 
managed by American Tower under its “use of economic rights” agreement with 
Telefónica is to be decommissioned and moved.141  An in-country legal expert indicated 
that the true significance of the case was that a new legal precedent has been established 
which is generating significant uncertainty around many other towers in AMT’s portfolio.

Even when not shaking down foreign investors, mercurial or poorly coordinated 
bureaucracies pose another operational risk.  In Brazil delays can be easily compounded 
due to what is described as “a complex web of permissions from local and federal 
authorities, often with long approval times [that] may mean that, when an investment  [in 
a base station] is signed off from an operator, it may take well over a year for a site to be 
made operational.”142 


Sovereign	
  Extortion	
  
 
Compounding carrier checkbook fatigue are instances of sovereign extortion.  In 
numerous counties in which American Tower operates, original spectrum licenses that its 
customers purchased are coming due for renewal, and cash hungry sovereigns expect 
carriers to pony up big for the privilege of providing service to their citizens.    
 
In January of 2013, Telefónica Peru, the market leader, finally concluded difficult 
negotiations over the renewal of its four licenses, which expired in May of 2011 and 
February of 2012.  The Peruvian government was seeking an investment of close to 
US$1.2 billion to provide coverage in rural areas, which the carriers avoid due to 
inadequate ROIs. As a result new infrastructure deployments planned in 2011, Telefónica 
delayed for over a year.143  As its customers get squeezed, corporate cost reduction 
initiatives will follow, putting “high-margin” cell phone tower lease rates and especially 
(post sale and lease-back) renewal terms under pressure.

India’s telecom scandal distressed the tower industry, resulting in the parent of a similarly 
sized competitor of AMT just filing for bankruptcy.144 


India’s 2008 2G spectrum auction scandal is a perfect example.145  The exposure of a 
massive bribery conspiracy resulted in 122 telecom licenses being revoked by the 
Supreme Court of India.146  This regulatory uncertainty contributed to market decline in 
subsequent years.  
 
In India and Africa landlords and even locally retained security guards have found 
additional ways to profit from their privileged access to a cell phone tower and its 
generator.  In these markets the problem of diesel fuel theft is a nagging and persistent.147   
Ironically, our towerco executive explained some landlords will “hold tower companies 
to ransom” seeking to have their relatives hired as the securities guards. 148

AMT has also engaged in transactions with a counter-party that has a record of 
questionable transactions, including allegedly defrauding his own company and 
shareholders. Ricardo Salinas and the Board of TV Azteca were changed by the SEC 
with engineering a scheme to conceal $109 million windfall profits earned through 
related party transactions.149,150  TV Azteca and Iusacell are both controlled by Salinas 
and remain significant customers in Mexico.  Prior to its 2009 default and 2010 debt 
restructuring with AMT, Iusacell was the Company’s largest international customer.151

  Defections	
  
 
As emerging market growth boomed and easy money flooded markets, competition in the 
capital-intensive tower co industry blossomed in Africa, India, and Brazil.  In Brazil, 
three of its competitors are former American Tower Executives. 
 
This both helped drive up tower prices while putting downward pressure on rents by 
providing carriers with multiple choices, after competing operators over built in urban 
areas, limiting opportunities for collocations.152  In such instances, tower companies face 
the options of buying out their competitors (which may inspire more start-ups to take 
their place) or losing additional revenue opportunities and lower IRR’s.   
 
Competition may also surface from former executives and employees who may use 
privileged information, knowledge, and know-how to start up new towerco’s and 
compete in the same markets.  For American Tower, this problem appears particularly 
acute in Latin America.  Numerous senior executives have left the company to launch 
competing businesses in the region including:  Eisenstein (co-founder and COO) as well 
as more recently Ray Ward (CEO, Brazil) and Alexandre Braga (VP, Managing Director, 
Brazil).153,154,155  Shareholders should take notice.  Such executive departures can indicate 
internal problems with management, strategy, or operations; weak non-compete 
agreements that do not protect senior executives from using “acquired customer 
relationships” for their own benefit; or both.

Macro-­‐Economic	
  Risks:	
  	
  Costs,	
  Costs,	
  and	
  More	
  Rising	
  Costs	
  
 
American Tower operates in countries that are prone to episodic inflationary spikes, 
currency volatility, and social upheaval.  These triple risks translate directly into costs.  In 
India inflation has increased to 9% and the Rupee has declined another 11% since 
May.156  Brazil’s inflation is again above 6% and its interest rates are at 9% or above 
while its currency has dropped 30% in the last three years and nearly 12% in the last 
three months (supra).  In response to high inflation and corruption massive street protests 
rocked Brazil through the month of June 2013.157  Even countries which recently have 
shown comparative recent stability such as Colombia present a patter of intermittent CPI 
spikes such as 8% in ‘08, over 20% in '98, and in excess of 30% in ’91.   EM investors 
must think carefully about the appropriate WACC and hurdle rates, especially when debt 
is being assumed to finance large transactions, as the Company has done both in USD 
and at times in local currency to finance its international acquisition binge  (supra).158   
 
CPI can help provide a good view of the macro economy, but as the particulars and 
quality of the official statistical metrics can vary from country to country, and may 
eliminate variable costs that impact real people, investors may be surprised when actual 
costs with a direct impact on their investment exceed their projections.  Telefónica (TEF) 
operates across Latin America reported that in 2012, that its personnel expenses for the 
region increased by 13.5% y-o-y (14.2% in organic terms).159  Since American Tower has 
followed Telefónica into many of these same markets and will be drawing from a similar 
labor pool, we expect that AMT should also encountering cost pressures for this item in 
its SG&A. 


Multinationals who utilize joint ventures as strategic investment may encounter 
partnership problems when business interests become misaligned.   For example, in the 
event that one Company does not wish to engage in an acquisition, to terminate the 
company, or possible even to repatriate funds, it may not be able to do so without the 
consent of the other.   In the case of American Tower we understand from industry 
insiders that AMT’s JV partners (Millicom and MTN) have sought to offload their rising 
operating costs into the JV.

EM Infrastructure May Be Targeted for Destruction by Maoist Rebels  
 
In March of 2013, Three cell phone towers belonging to American Movil, a customer of 
AMT, in the southern Andean region of Peru assaulted and destroyed.  Initial press 
reports indicates that this act was carried out by the Maoist guerilla group Sendero 
Luminos (Shining Path).160   


Q: HOW DO YOU KNOW WHEN WALL STREET IS SETTING 
INVESTORS UP FOR A FALL? A: WHEN ANALYSTS’ MODELS 
DISAGREE ON EVERYTHING, EXCEPT TARGET PRICE. 
 
Wall Street is conditioning investors to accept as Gospel the notion that the Company is 
going to grow its AFFO and dividend over the foreseeable future 15% and 20%, 
respectively.  The source of these prognostications is AMT’s management, but yet we 
note that Mr. Taiclet sells approximately 90% of the shares he receives from option 
exercises.  Analysts are taking the Company at its word.  We have analyzed five Street 
analysts’ models, and it is clear that analysts have not developed models that can test 
management’s assumptions.  The table below compares four of the analysts’ models 
across price, WACC, terminal growth, and average 2013 tenants per tower (domestic and 
international) in 2013.  (One analyst’s model did not give enough detail to compare it to 
the others.)  The analysts’ key assumptions vary significantly, but the one item on which 
they are most consistent is price.  
 


 
 
One issue is that two analysts assumed that the ending 2012 tenants per tower were 
materially greater than 2.0, when the 10-K makes clear that the global average is 2.0.161 
 
There are two major issues that have made AMT un-modelable.  First, the international 
business is completely opaque to the analysts.  This is not surprising, but it is troubling 
for investors who are counting on the international business for growth.  Second, AMT 
has not been nearly transparent enough for its domestic business.  It tells analysts “Just 
trust us” and model 6% to 8% annual US growth.

Can’t Model 6% to 8% Revenue Growth in the US Going Forward?  Just 
Take the Company’s Word for it. 
 
One of the critical information gaps in AMT’s domestic business is how AMT expects to 
continue to generate 6% to 8% topline growth.  AMT recently disclosed that it generated 
approximately 60% of its US revenue under master lease agreements (“MLAs”) with 
three carriers.162  The MLAs are umbrella agreements that serve as the framework for 
individual site leases.  The MLAs presently in effect have seven to eight years remaining 
until expiration.  The MLAs have annual rent “escalators” that increase rent about 3.5% 
per year.  The rent escalators under the currently effective MLAs provide for carriers to 
be able to add a certain amount of 4G equipment to the towers without additional 
changes. 
 
During the past several years, AMT has grown its domestic top line well in excess of the 
escalator amounts.  The difference largely comes from what AMT calls “amendments” to 
its individual site leases.  “Amendment” is a catch all term that covers a range of fees and 
charges that carriers pay when they add equipment to a tower.  Examples of fees that 
would be considered “amendments” are site lease modification application fees, 
structural integrity study fees, as well as increased rent from additional equipment.  We 
understand that there are a range of charges carriers must pay.  We also understand that 
carriers (perhaps unsurprisingly) are not fond of this pricing structure, and feel as though 
they are being nickel and dimed.   
 
The first problem for investors is that it is unclear what 4G network expansion carriers 
are paying for under the MLA escalators.  Without understanding this, how can investors 
make their own assumptions about AMT’s forward revenue growth?  Fortunately, the 
SEC’s Corporate Finance division was attune to this issue, and on March 18, 2013, it 
asked AMT why it has not these agreements as exhibits, as would seem to be required by 
Regulation S-K.163   
 
AMT disappointingly disagreed that Regulation S-K requires it to file the MLAs.  AMT 
concluded that the MLAs are not “material contracts”, and thus it does not need to 
disclose them.164  It therefore appears it will not do so.  AMT’s determination is suspect, 
given that a common sense test tells us these MLAs are material.   
 
Our opinion as to why AMT refuses to disclose the MLAs is that it views such 
transparency as an enemy – that if investors had access to more information, they would 
not be willing to pay anywhere near the current share price.  Thoughts about a company’s 
share price are likely seldom far from the mind of a CEO whose compensation is partly 
tied to stock price performance, and who also consistently exercises options, and then 
sells approximately 90% of the shares (see AMT’s Compensation Incentivizes Value

Destruction; CCI Is More Prudent supra).  It would be hard to justify withholding MLAs 
for “competitive reasons” in this industry – there does not appear to be any valuable 
intellectual property in this business model. 
 
We believe that the carriers will soon have most of the headroom they need under the 
MLAs to upgrade their networks for two reasons; therefore, amendments will generate 
much less revenue than they have in recent years.  First, the carriers have already 
completed the vast majority of their network upgrades that will take place on towers.  
VZ’s CEO has said that VZ is 95% done with its 4G upgrades.  Second, as explained 
supra carriers are now using alternatives to macro towers (including network equipment 
sharing), and these alternatives can have much lower lifetime costs to the carriers than 
does the tower model.  Both VZ and T will be densifying their networks largely with 
“small cells” (see Cellular Towers Are Soon To Become the Most Expensive Option of 
Last Resort; The Halcyon Days Are Over supra).  T-Mobile US, Inc. (NYSE: TMUS) is 
only 50% finished with its network upgrades, but it expects to only increasing network 
service spending 2% in 2013, after which it should be substantially done with its 4G 
upgrades.165  We see the days of carriers blowing through their built-in escalators as 
largely a phenomenon of the past.

APPENDIX A.1: VALUATION 
 
Based on the application of the discounted cash flow method, we estimate that the value 
of AMT stock is: 


$44.57 per share 
At the target share price, a shareholder is acquiring the Company at the following 
valuation metrics. 





Common stock should be valued based on discounting the expected future free cash flow 
by a factor that reflects the risks inherent in the business.  Because the shareholders have 
the lowest priority in the capital structure, the cost of capital should be at a level that is 
higher than prevailing risk free government bond rates (as well as corporate bonds rates), 
reflects the risks of declines in cash flow and dividend paying capacity, and when 
investing internationally, the risks associated with repatriating capital from a foreign 
currency back into US dollars (as well as a myriad of other regulatory risks we have 
identified).   
 
Equity investors, including REIT investors, are accepting risk that is much greater than 
the risk associated with debt, and an equity risk premium is appropriate in developing a 
discount rate to apply to future cash flows.  We have used a conservative 9.5% discount 
factor to apply to the unleveraged free cash flow.  This discount factor was based on a 
bottom up analysis of the discount rates for each of the countries in which the company 
operates, weighted by the free cash flow contribution from the respective region. 
 
The sensitivity table below provides a range of per share price estimates based on varying 
risk and long term growth outcomes.
‘Page 78 of 118	
  


 
 
As more fully discussed in Appendix A.6, applying a multiple to AFFO is not an 
appropriate valuation methodology for an alternative REIT such as American Tower.  
American Tower’s assets depreciate much faster than a traditional real estate asset, are 
subject to technology risks, require substantially more maintenance and refurbishment 
expenditures, have no other uses, and rarely have land ownership.  Therefore, we believe 
the best approach to arriving at a valuation of the enterprise and common stock is to 
discount the future cash flows by an appropriate discount rate. 
 
We have developed 10-year projections for each region in which the Company operates 
(see Appendices A.3, A.4, and A.5) in order to arrive at an estimate of the unleveraged 
free cash flow of the combined business.  Sources of information for our analysis 
included local tower company operators, local industry experts, local tax consultants, 
local tower construction companies, Wall Street research, 3rd party industry research, 
public SEC filings, local American Tower subsidiary financial statement filings (where 
available) and various other sources.  Our due diligence shows that the AMT growth 
story is overstated.  Cases in point include the M&A driven international expansion story 
we have discussed in much more detail throughout the report, and management’s misuse 
of capital (e.g., the missing US$250 million, poor returns on identified international 
acquisitions, and questionable lending transactions).  
 
We have developed a detailed bottom up financial model that utilizing the following 
drivers: 
 
Rental Income Sales 
 
Rental income sales represent AMT’s primary business, in which the Company leases 
space on its towers.  Our rental income sales estimate was based on detailed estimates of 
new tower additions, tenants per tower, average contractual rents per tower, contractual 
rent escalators, market rents, expiration of existing contracts, rent abatements, contract 
renegotiations, and for international assets, the mix between traditional fixed towers and 
rooftop structures.  Typically, US contracts have fixed price escalators while international 
contracts have floating CPI-based escalators.  Investors should pay close attention to rent 
abatement and market rents versus contractual rents.  Our analysis shows that the 
contractual rents are much higher than market rents in many regions.  Downward rent 
price pressures will partially offset new tower and tenant growth as well as existing price 
escalators.
‘Page 79 of 118	
  


 
Pass through Sales/Costs 
 
Pass through sales are costs associated with ground leases and / or fuel costs.  Typically, 
fuel costs are passed through in India and EMEA, while ground leases are passed through 
in Latin America.  Pass through costs do not have a cash flow impact on the business.  
Carriers reimburse the Company for such costs.  Pass through costs present a particularly 
high risk for tower companies because carriers are looking for ways to push costs onto 
tower companies.   This will force tower companies to invest more heavily into 
alternative energy and cost saving technologies. 
 
Direct COGS 
 
Direct cost of goods sold includes ground rent, monitoring, insurance, real estate taxes, 
utilities, site maintenance, and other costs.  We have projected direct COGS as a fixed 
cost per tower.  Per tower direct COGS were estimated to grow by the contractual 
escalator, which is typically inflation based.  The single largest operating cost is ground 
lease expense.  As we have discussed in the report, land aggregators and the market’s 
increasing awareness that tower companies will pay much higher prices to ensure they 
have the land will continue to put upward pressure on ground lease costs.  As ground 
leases expire, the costs will grow at a faster rate than inflation in the US market. 
 
Direct SG&A 
 
Direct SG&A costs include selling, general and administrative costs associated with the 
region, and exclude corporate level SG&A.  For purposes of our analysis, direct SG&A 
costs were estimated to be partially fixed and partially variable.  
 
Regional Segment EBITDA 
 
Regional Segment EBITDA was based on each country’s sales minus direct operating 
expenses.  We also factored in Year 1 foreign currency impacts to reflect the current view 
of currency rates relative to the most recent reporting period.  After Year 1, we have 
assumed a constant currency.  In the constant currency scenario, we estimated CPI 
escalators will be between 2%-3%, depending on the region.  
 
Regional Capital Expenditures 
 
We projected capital expenditures by region based on the number of new tower builds, 
the projected new tower cost, maintenance costs per tower, improvement costs per tower, 
and refurbishment costs per tower.  Our diligence included discussions with tower 
company manufacturers who have direct experience in AMT’s markets.  We assessed the 
quality of the towers and the ability to add tenants to existing towers, given the existing 
tower condition.  The Company will need to make significant improvements in many of 
its towers to meet tenant per tower projections.  We believe the Company really did not 
know what it was buying in some large transactions.
‘Page 80 of 118	
  


 
Consolidated Income Statement 
 
The Regional Segment EBITDA was rolled up into a consolidated Segment EBITDA 
estimate.  In the consolidated income statement, we included network services, and other 
revenues and expenses, such as employee stock options, corporate level SG&A, TV 
Azteca income, and certain other non cash expenses related to lease to arrive at a 
consolidated EBITDA estimate. 
 
Interest Expense 
 
For purposes of calculating interest expense, we assumed that the Company would pay 
down some debt.  But, the majority of debt was assumed to be rolled over into new debt 
upon maturity at comparable interest rates.  A sharp rise in interest rates poses a risk to 
equity investors as the Company currently has approximately US$8.4 billion of net debt 
on its balance sheet. 
 
Depreciation 
 
Depreciation was calculated using an 11-year life for existing assets and a 20-year life for 
new capital additions.   
 
Minority	
  Interest	
  
 
We have excluded non-wholly owned income and cash flows from our valuation.  Based 
on our analysis, we believe the Company consolidates approximately US$40 million to 
US$50 million of non-wholly owned EBITDA. 
 
Capital expenditure‬‬‬� 
 
Capital expenditures were based on regional direct capital expenditures estimates, plus 
corporate level capital expenditures.  We have estimated new tower capital expenditures, 
maintenance and improvements, redevelopment, ground lease purchases, and other 
corporate level capital expenditures. 
 
Foreign Currency Gains and Losses 
 
Foreign currency gains and losses relate to the currency impact on intercompany loans 
and certain cash balances.  Given the substantial declines in the foreign currencies in 
which the Company operates, we expect significant losses on intercompany loan and cash 
balances.  However, because we do not have the required information to project the dollar 
amount of the expected losses, we highlight that if these losses come to fruition over the 
next year, all else being equal, the net income and other cash flow metrics in our 
projections would be lower by the amount of the loss (and vice versa).‬ � 
 
Changes in Operating Assets and Liabilities
‘Page 81 of 118	
  


 
Operating assets and liabilities includes certain current assets and current liabilities.  
Excluded assets and liabilities encompass interest bearing obligations, and cash.  We 
have projected operating assets and liabilities as a percentage of sales.  Over the 10-year 
period, we have assumed that this ratio remains relatively constant.
‘Page 82 of 118	
  


 
Other Contingent Obligations 
 
Other contingent obligations include buyout options for the Verizon sale / leaseback and 
SBC sale / leaseback portfolios that have a combined cost of US$1.2 billion.  The 
Company also has US$25 million in earn outs that come due.  Although the company 
discloses a US$1.5 billion obligation for tower asset retirements, we have not factored 
this cost into our numbers.  We have also not factored in the potential purchase of 
TriStar, which owns the land under approximately 650 of the Company’s towers.  We 
estimate that the Company would pay US$400 million to US$500 million to acquire 
TriStar.  It is also important to note, that some contracts have provisions that allow for the 
carrier to take over the tower if the land under the tower is lost by American Tower. 
 
Discount Rate 
 
As more fully discussed in Appendix A.2, we estimate that a 9.5% risk factor is 
appropriate for AMT. 
 
Long Term Growth 
 
We have assumed a long term growth rate in unleveraged free cash flow of 3% per year 
after year 10. 
 
Other Factors 
 


• We have included only organic tower growth.   
• We have included interest income from the TV Azteca loan and assumed that the 


loan will be repaid in Year 9 of the projections. 
• We have not included potential dilution from ESO issuance.

APPENDIX A.5: COST OF CAPITAL 
 
We developed discount rates utilizing three primary approaches to estimate the required return on 
capital. 
 
Damodaran Methodology 
 
For our first approach, we consulted the research and published work of NYU professor Aswath 
Damodaran. Prof. Damodaran is widely recognized as one the foremost authorities on corporate finance 
and equity valuation.  His research has been featured prominently in CFA Institute materials regarding 
international investing and calculation of cost of capital and hurdle rates. Prof. Damodaran has 
developed a formula that takes into account home market equity risk premium and then adding a 
premium based on the risks of the foreign market. The foreign market risks are priced as a function of 
local currency interest rates plus adjustments for local equity and credit market volatility.   
As we have discussed, investing in emerging markets carries substantial risks.  Not all of those risks are 
going to be appropriately priced purely by interest rates or local equity risk premium.  In many emerging 
markets various political or other crises have emerged which manifest themselves in rapidly changing 
assets price markets.  Therefore, any sophisticated analysis must actually incorporate the volatility of 
financial assets in the local market. Standard CAPM assumptions are basic things that are simply untrue 
in many foreign markets such as perfect markets, diversified investor portfolios, and information 
symmetry 
 
In order to adjust for the myriad of risks of foreign markets, Prof Damodaran has developed the 
following formula that a home country investor should use when investing abroad: 
 


Country Total Equity Risk Premium = (Equity Risk Premium for Mature Market such as 
SPX) + ((Sovereign 10YR CDS – US 10YR CDS) * (Country Equity Vol / Country 


Yield Vol)) 
 
This allows for the “roller coaster behavior” that EM capital markets display.  The returns to compensate 
for ever-changing risks in foreign markets should be a function of the volatility. Using professor 
Damodaran’s formula, we get the following costs of capital: 
 


 
 
We should note a couple of important points in the above table.  10-year bond yields in local currency 
were unavailable for Ghana, and so we priced the 3 year Ghanaian vs. US rates. In addition, there was
‘Page 109 of 118	
  


not enough historical data to calculate the volatility of Ugandan 10-year bond yields.  Some of these 
numbers look high, but just yourself what you would demand to invest in a Ugandan project in local 
currency relative to developed markets?  
 
CAPM Methodology 
 
The second method we used was the more standard CAPM model.  This model has certain problems 
mentioned earlier, but it is important to consider in addition to the Damodaran model. The Capital Asset 
Pricing Model is probably the most widely used when it comes to calculating WACC.  The CAPM 
incorporates interest rates, spreads, tax rates and the theoretical equity return demanded by market 
participants. Any financial industry professional is probably more familiar with this model than they 
care to admit.  
 


 
 
The above table contains certain assumptions.  Because the Company does not fund locally in each 
market, we used proxies or the company’s credit spread in dollars in order to determine cost of debt in 
the local market. This means using America Movil in Mexico as they are the largest carrier, Bharti 
Infratel in India since it is a direct comp, and MTN in South Africa.  The equity risk premium numbers 
come from historical analysis and Bloomberg. It is a weakness of CAPM to understate ERP when 
looking at high interest rate local markets coupled with low equity index returns.  
 
Hurdle Rate Methodology 
 
The Company operates in three primary regional areas: developed, emerging, and frontier markets.  
Based on discussions with local tower company operators, and international investors, we believe 
companies that are considering an investment in a region, the following IRR hurdle rates are used: 
 


• Developed Market – 7% - 10% 
• Emerging Markets – 10% - 17% 
• Frontier Markets – 17% - 25%
‘Page 110 of 118	
  


 
 
 
 
Selected Cost of Capital 
 
We selected discount rates that we believe reflect the risks associated with operating in the respective 
countries.  The appropriate discount rate to use for American Tower is 9.5%.  We have utilized the 
discount rates in the below table for discounting regional cash flows.

APPENDIX A.6: AFFO 
 
What is AFFO? 
 
AMT has, in its conference calls, stressed the growth in Adjusted Funds From Operations (“AFFO”) as 
one of its most important metrics, and this appears to have been followed by ATL’s telecom analysts. 
There appears to be some confusion by both AMT and its telecom analysts regarding what AFFO is. 
Tom Bartlett, ATL’s CFO, appears to believe that AFFO is defined by the National Association of Real 
Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) and that ATL’s formulation of AFFO aligns identically to the 
definitions NAREIT has outlined.166 ATL’s analysts also believe that ATL’s reported AFFO number 
allows them to compare AMT to that of REITs.167 However, NAREIT does not define AFFO and 
emphasizes in its 2002 White Paper that there is no definition of AFFO (emphasis added): 
 


“Although there is some considerable overlap among analysts as to what might be appropriate 
adjustments to Funds From Operations that would make it a better measure of dividend paying 
capacity, NAREIT believes that there is not adequate consensus among preparers and users of 
the REIT financial statements to allow agreement on a single definition of Funds (Cash) 
Available for Distribution or AFFO. Further, NAREIT does not believe that there is a single 
measure of distributable cash that is consistently applicable to all REITs.”168 


 
Nevertheless, NAREIT provides a possible disclosure that can be used to develop AFFO in its National 
Policy Bulletin in February 2004:169 
 


 
However, we researched a large number of REITs to identity the “comparable AFFO” metric, but few of 
them had the same formulation as ATL; and, many of them only report a Funds From Operation 
(“FFO”) figure. 
 
We believe that the confusion about AFFO arose because the analysts following AMT are almost 
exclusive telecom specialists, rather than REIT specialists. Additionally, the issue may just be trying fit 
a square peg into a round hole.  AMT is not a traditional REIT; however, the market appears to be

basing its valuation on other traditional REITs, with little reference to the substantial differences 
between them.  
 
ATL’s AFFO number is not based on an industry standard, and any comparison to more traditional 
REITs is of little value to shareholders, unless further adjustments are made. Again, AMT is a non-
traditional REIT and one should be wary of forcing a square peg into a round hole in order to value the 
company. 
 
What is more to the point is that ATL’s 2012 FFO calculation was not in line with the NAREIT 
definition at all, and it was only brought into line with the NAREIT definition in Q1 2013. The change 
in ATL’s definition of AFFO from 2012 to 2013, unsurprisingly lead to a boost in AFFO. In the 8-K for 
Q1 2012, AFFO was calculated as being $296m, in Q1 2013 this is restated to $326m.  
 
The Formulation 
 
In analyzing ATL’s AFFO calculation we have found a series of add backs and exclusions that seem to 
overstate the AFFO, which we detail below: 
 
Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization vs. Recurring Capital Expenditure 
 
The main reason for NAREIT establishing FFO as a supplemental measure was because GAAP net 
income does not sufficiently represent a REIT’s earnings, particularly as regards depreciation: 
 


“Historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate 
assets diminishes predictably over time. Since real estate values instead have historically risen 
or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors have considered presentations of 
operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient 
by themselves.”170 


 
As above, depreciation accounting does not reflect a REIT’s true business because the values of a 
REIT’s assets are not diminishing predictably over time, but rather move with the market. However, we 
do not believe the same can be said for tower companies.  
 
There are two elements to a tower company’s real estate assets, the tower itself and the ground lease 
underneath the tower.  
 
We understand that, even with maintenance, a tower usually has a useful life of 25 to 30 years before it 
needs to be replaced.  Its value diminishes over time, and is not market driven; therefore, depreciation is 
a relatively fair measure. For the ground leases, while some of these may be owned by the tower 
company, a large proportion are leased on a long-term basis generally for five years with three 
additional options to renew.  The tower company’s right over these ground leases therefore diminishes 
in value over time as it approaches the renewal date.  
 
In light of the foregoing, a proportion of a tower company’s real estate does not rise and fall with the 
market, as per NAREIT’s definition, but diminishes over time in line, to a large extent, with 
depreciation.  It can therefore be argued that adding back the full amount of depreciation is over valuing 
ATL’s operations, because these are not apartment buildings that will rise and fall with market value.

‘Page 114 of 118	
  


Towers are assets with finite lives that will need replacing or renewing at a cash cost, and so should not 
be added back to the AFFO. 
 
Additionally, AMT is taking a doubt benefit in its AFFO. While it adds back the full depreciation cost to 
the AFFO, assuming the value of their property does not diminish, it fails to account for cash outflows 
that allow these assets to retain their value, such as cost of ground lease purchases, extensions, and 
maintenance capital expenditure. 
 
AMT should not be adding back the full amount of its real estate depreciation into its AFFO calculation, 
however, if it does then it should at least deduct the cash cost of maintaining the value of these assets - 
namely the cost to purchase and extend ground leases and maintenance CapEx. 
 
The cost to extend or purchase a ground lease, while non-recurring for each individual lease, is 
nevertheless a recurring cost to ATL, which has thousands such leases on its books. 
 
This would amount to a deduction from AFFO of US$125 million in 2013.171 
 
Stock Based Compensation 
 
While this has no cash effect in the period it is expensed in the Income Statement, it is nevertheless a 
real cost to shareholders in the future. Additionally, adding this back and comparing the AFFO to many 
REITs, which pay salaries in cash with no future expense to shareholders, will overstate the value of 
AMT compared to its competitors.  Not adding this back to AFFO would reduce it by US$65 million in 
2013. 
 
Non-Real Estate Depreciation and Amortization 
 
NAREIT states that this should not be included in FFO, and because it is a non-cash item it seems 
reasonable for AMT to remove this from its AFFO; however, traditional REITs usually have limited 
non-real estate depreciation of 1.2% of total depreciation, whereas ATL’s is much more significant, 
approximately 12%. Even though non-real estate depreciation is a non-cash item, if comparing to more 
traditional REITs that will not bear such an additional cost of replacement in the future, this add back 
overstates the value of AMT as a comparator. 
 
Redevelopment CapEx and Start-up CapEx 
 
AMT is taking a double benefit. First, it wishes to increase its tenancy ratio, which leads to organic 
growth.  However, a number of the towers, particularly in the emerging markets, were only built to 
handle one tenant and need redevelopment CapEx to handle additional tenants.  Because the 
redevelopment CapEx is a recurring capital expenditure, and it is related to the organic growth, this 
should be deducted from the AFFO. 
 
Start-up CapEx was deducted from the AFFO in 2012, however, for Q1 2013, AMT was decided that 
this should no longer be deducted from AFFO.172 No reason was given for it no longer being deducted, 
because this is most likely additional maintenance work on towers in Emerging Markets, this is a 
recurring cash outflow and should be deducted from the AFFO.

In total these items would decrease AFFO by US$150 million in 2013.173 
  
Repatriation of Cash 
 
AMT has openly stated that it is not seeking to repatriate cash from its foreign subsidiaries; however, as 
the international segment grows and AMT has to convert more of its Taxable REIT Subsidiaries into 
Qualified REIT Subsidiaries in order to satisfy the REIT tests, it will need to start paying dividends from 
its cash abroad. Shareholders should, therefore, be aware that there will be significant costs and taxes 
incurred in repatriating this cash, which are not accounted for in the AFFO.   
 
Conclusion 
 
AFFO has become the metric of choice in comparing AMT with other REITs, however, it cannot be 
stressed enough that, as per NAREIT, there is no one methodology of calculating AFFO and rarely will 
one be comparing apples to apples. In light of this, valuations based on ATL’s AFFO compared to those 
of traditional REITs are misleading and inaccurate. Additionally, ATL’s current AFFO methodology 
does not truly reflect the Company’s cash position, and not enough cash outflows have been accounted 
for.
