Spruce Point Issues 
Follow-up Report on Caesarstone


3


• Since Spruce Point’s initial report on Caesarstone (Nasdaq: CSTE or “the Company”), which highlighted many fundamental 
issues facing the Company, along with potential accounting irregularities:


• Two key Board members have resigned for nebulous reasons pertaining to Board governance matters
• A 5% shareholder completely exited its position
• No stock buyback or insiders purchases have been made
• CSTE has not reiterated its guidance, and something seems amiss in the story 


• In our opinion, many of the open questions remain inadequately addressed, or completely ignored, by the Company and its 
group of supporting analysts. Spruce Point’s follow-up report reiterates open questions and delves deeper into the issues we 
believe are facing Caesarstone. 


• This report will highlight additional potential accounting issues which are related to capital expenditures:


• Caesarstone’s U.S. facility is vastly more expensive than peer manufacturing facilities around the world, is over budget 
by $30m (30% above initial estimates of $100m), and the Company does not appear to be offering specific details on the 
exact cost drivers of the project. The current project cost amounts to ~10% of its market cap 


• Furthermore, this follow-up report will explore management’s history at Tefron (OTCBB TFRFF), a formerly NYSE listed public 
company, that failed under the leadership of CSTE’s current CEO Yosef (“Yos”) Shiran: 


• A detailed behavioral analysis suggests that an eerily similar timeline and playbook of events may be unfolding at CSTE. 
Most notably, we find that Tefron also faced consistent issues of misguiding its capex costs


• Its CEO Yos Shiran unloaded Tefron stock at peak prices before margins ultimately collapsed, admissions that Tefron 
could not adequately compete on price, and before directors would resign with one director openly questioning 
management’s budgeting process 


• Tefron’s stock ultimately fell >85% from its high before being delisted on the NYSE. A nearly identical sequence of events 
appears to be currently unfolding at Caesarstone
New Concerns Raised About Capex Spending, 
Increased Risk of Potential Acct’g Fraud


4


U.S. Plant Expansion 30% Over Budget (initially $100m, now $130m) and Substantially Higher Cost Than Peers
• CSTE’s U.S. expansion project was announced in late 2013 and its cost, initially estimated at $100m, increased by $15m to $115m in 


Q2’14. Its cost estimate was raised another $15m to $130m in Q1’15 ahead of its sales guidance reduction 
• On a per sqft basis, the plant expansion is ~60% more than Cambria’s expansion in Minnesota and ~45% more expensive than its own 


Bar-Lev expansion from 2004–2007. LG is also upgrading capacity in Georgia for a total of just $90m for two production lines
• CSTE has been baiting investors about its U.S. growth story and plant expansion since 2013, and now the plant is practically idled with 


limited production. We also don’t believe that CSTE is offering investors any detailed breakdown of its plant construction costs
• It makes no economic sense to us that CSTE invested 10% of its market cap in a plant asset with no definitive time table to full production


Heightened Risk of Potential Accounting Irregularities From Overstatement of Earnings Due to Cost Capitalization
• CSTE’s motivation to raise its capex cost estimate of the U.S. facility by $30 million could be to capitalize operating costs to its balance 


sheet, and thereby overstate earnings. CSTE does not disclose how much costs have been capitalized
• CSTE’s PP&E accounts have increased by more than its reported capex through the cash flow statement by ~$10m in 2013-14
• CSTE has given a variety of nebulous excuses for the $30m cost increase. Its most recent explanation was that it needs to fine tune its 


equipment, improve environmental conditions, and add a new showroom. We are skeptical of these explanations, especially in light of 
our request to the Georgia Environmental Dept that found no outstanding environmental issues


• There are precedent examples of companies having committed fraud by repeated capex line increases and overcapitalization of normal 
operating expenses to inflate EPS and hide sales shortfalls. For example, on September 8, 2008 the SEC charged American Italian Pasta 
(Nasdaq: AIPC) with accounting fraud. Is CSTE following a similar playbook?


CSTE Doesn’t Even Own Its U.S. Facility, The Project Has Been 100% Pledged, and is Behind Production Schedule 
• Buried in its 20-F, CSTE disclosed a transaction whereby the Bryan Country Economic Authority granted CSTE tax breaks for locating within 


the county. There is very limited disclosure about this financing
• We filed a Georgia Open Records Request (GORA) to unseal the documents and found that in December 2014, CSTE structured a $100m 


credit facility @ 6% interest cost ($35m verified draw-down as of 12/31/14). The transaction is supposedly non-cash, and structured 
similar to a sale/leaseback to provide tax incentives subject to investment and hiring goals. Importantly, CSTE has pledged the entire 
project to Bryan County which means it does not currently have title to its facility yet derives economic benefits from it


• Given that CSTE is experiencing slackening demand, and at risk of not meeting its goals (note only 107 people hired as of 5/27/15 vs. 180 
required), it may not be able to reclaim ownership of its facility, which could potentially leave investors with a big tax bill and little asset 
value recovery in the case of bankruptcy
Additional Concerns About Management’s 
History, Downgrading Price Target


5


Management’s History at Tefron, A Failed Israeli Garment Manufacturer, Provides Insight Into How The Dominos May Fall
• CSTE’s CEO and General Counsel and VP of Business Development worked at Tefron, a former NYSE listed public company, which collapsed 


from bad execution and mismanagement according to reports. Tefron’s auditor is CSTE’s current auditor
• Tefron was promoting a period of rapid sales and margin expansion along with a unique Italian manufacturing technology.  CEO Shiran 


liquidated stock before its margins collapsed. Later Tefron admitted to investors its manufacturing technology faced problems, and it could
not compete with lower cost foreign producers


• Our analysis suggests that Tefron consistently misguided investors about its capex estimates every single year by an average of 137% 
per year from 2003 – 2010! Is it just a coincidence that CSTE has raised its capex estimate twice in under one year?


• In 2009, after CEO Shiran resigned, but while Michal Baumwald was still with Tefron, Director Micha Korman resigned and questioned 
management’s budgeting process and communication with the Board. His warning appears prescient in light of Tefron’s rapid decline and 
ultimate delisting from the NYSE


• Ironically, two Caesarstone directors, Ram Belinkov and Avner Naveh, resigned from its Board in late September. SEC filings have given a 
nebulous explanation for each director’s resignation, but this suggest differences of opinion over governance and Board matters


Downgrading Price Target on Weakening Fundamentals and Heightened Risk of Potential Accounting Irregularities
• A majority of our initial concerns have not been adequately addressed, most notably, how can CSTE maintain its perception of being a 


premium product with inconsistent quartz content messaging to consumers (88%?, 90%?, 93%?), and maintain prices with cheaper 
imports being offered at up to 25% lower price points?


• Recent North America import data shows the largest monthly decline in history of CSTE’s products and amplifies our concerns that its 
2016 sales and EPS expectations are at risk of disappointing. With its U.S. facility reportedly producing immaterial amounts of products, 
CSTE is dependent on imports from Israel. Thus, we believe the import data is a highly reliable indicator of future revenue and earnings 
shortfalls. Further, CSTE’s inventory growth is now outpacing revenue growth by the widest margin since 2011 


• CSTE still trades at 2.1x and 7.5x 2016E inflated Wall St. sales and EBITDA estimates (unlikely to be achieved) on the belief sales will grow 
18% next year and margins can be maintained.  Yet, our findings suggest that its sales may be stagnant and its EBITDA may be overstated 
by up to $30 million in the event it has over-capitalized its cost overrun to its balance sheet. In our view, it is trading at closer to 2.3x and 
9.5x forward sales and EBITDA. It is also important to consider that since CSTE’s capex may be artificially high, it should be evaluated on a 
free cash flow basis (CFO – capex). Free cash flow has been flat/negative for 5 out of the last 6 quarters. 


• We lower our price target to ~$8.50 - $23.00/share on a 6x – 8x 2016 EBITDA (lower/realistic multiple) and assume just 5% revenue 
growth. We also factor in $34m of potential silicosis liabilities which analysts models’ ignore. A recent TV documentary in Israel 
highlighting the severity of the “Caesarstone silicosis epidemic” underscores the risk to shareholders of adverse legal judgments
Open Questions For Management


6


Product Quality and “Premium” Branding
a. Why is a 93% quartz being advertised by CSTE and its distributors when our lab tests suggest the true quartz content is 88-89%?
b. Should CSTE consider clarifying what is considered a “Premium” quartz countertop?
c. How does CSTE maintain its “Premium” branding while continuing to lower R&D spend and headcount?
d. If the product is “Premium” why sell it as a generic product at a discount retailer like IKEA?  


Market and Sales Growth
a. What is CSTE’s plan with its new U.S. production facility given it is not materially producing and the market is being flooded with 


cheap imports from China, India, Vietnam, Russia and other countries?
b. Why does CSTE not disclose unit slab sales and average pricing per slab by product line?
c. How has CSTE historically grown sales at a 20%+ growth rate with flat U.S. TEU import data according to our source


Margin Contraction
a. Why did CSTE not cut its 2015E EBITDA range last quarter and instead maintain it by slowing the ramp of production at the new


facility? Is CSTE implicitly telling investors that its sales demand no longer remains robust?
b. If the Kibbutz were not a substantial owner of CSTE, would its agreements with them increase or decrease its operating costs 


and what would be the margin impact?  Why did a Kibbutz board member resign?
c. Why did CSTE say that its raw material price for quartz went up just 4% in the face of evidence from its own supply contracts


that the annual impact was approximately double? 
d. Why did CSTE request a 5 year confidentiality period for its recent quartz supply contracts?  
e. How much more will CSTE bear from importing costs from places like Turkey to its U.S. production facility in Georgia?


Currency Effects
a. Why did CSTE change its functional currency to the US$ and why doesn’t it discuss in more detail the impact on its margins?
b. Why does CSTE include currency effects in the Net Finance Expense income statement line item rather than reporting it as an 


Other Expense line item?
Anomalous Capital Expenditures


a. Why is CSTE’s capex estimate for its U.S. facility 30% above its initial estimate, 60% more than comparable peer plants on a per 
sqft basis, and 45% more expensive than its Bar-Lev facility?


b. Why did CSTE give limited details about its Bryan Country financing and tax arrangement and why did it agree to pledge the 
entire project?


c. Why doesn’t CSTE disclose the exact amount of costs capitalized on its balance sheet during the construction period?

Comparison Between Caesarstone and 
China Integrated Energy, A Company We 
Exposed That Became Delisted


8


Date China Integrated Energy - 2011 Caesarstone - 2015


Listing/Ticker Nasdaq: CBEH Nasdaq: CSTE


Questionable 
Auditor


Sherb & Co. is based in the U.S. although CBEH was 
China-based. Sherb &Co. received significant PCAOB 


warning comments in 2011


Kost Forer Gabbay & Kasierer
Based in Israel, and also received PCAOB audit 


quality citations of concern


Growth Story Raised money from U.S. investors to build a novel
and technologically advanced plant to produce 


biodiesel with prickly ash in China


Raised money from U.S. investors to build a technologically 
advanced quartz manufacturing facility in Georgia to tap U.S. 


“potential” demand for its products


Questionable 
Capex Costs


CBEH’s capital expenditure efficiency was so vastly 
superior to any other reported biodiesel provider 


we analyzed. CBEH had abnormally low capex costs 
on a per gallon basis


Georgia plant is significantly more expensive on a price per 
sqft basis than globally located plants in the U.S., Canada, 


and Spain with not enough detail from the Company to 
critically analyze


Plant Utilization Main plant was not being utilized at all, but 
staged for investors


U.S. plant is operating, but significantly below potential 
utilization at the moment


Gross Margins Stable and consistent margins in a cyclical and
commoditized business


Fairly stable gross margins even as quartz prices have risen, 
and pricing has gotten more competitive. Gross margins are 


high relative to U.S. listed building product peers


R&D Spending Reported no spending on R&D, so it was difficult to 
believe that it had invented any advantage in a 


production process


Claims “World Class Manufacturing and R&D Capabilities” 
yet R&D margin has fallen significantly in the past few years 


to just 0.6% of sales


Difference 
between SEC / 
Foreign Financials


CBEH’s SAIC Chinese financials showed a substantial 
departure from SEC filings


Australian and Singapore foreign filings show significantly 
lower gross margins, explained as due to transfer pricing


Many similarities between our investigative research that exposed China Integrated Energy in 2011 and Caesarstone.

Analyst Rebuttals Weak, Our Key 
Questions Remain Outstanding:


9


Our Key Concern Our Key Evidence Company and Analyst Rebuttal


Product may not contain 
93% quartz as advertised


Independent
Lab Test


Analysts and Company say: the product contains “up to 93%” and an “optimal” amount
We say: Not a single sample in our test hit 90% and CSTE allows its distributors to market 
93% creating the appearance of misrepresentation to consumers. 


Margins May Be Overstated 
Due to Quartz Prices 
Rising +20%


Company’s Own Quartz 
Supply Contracts


Analysts and Company say: But the 20% increase was over 2yrs and is only one supplier 
contract accounting for 30% of supply
We say:  Yes, but that’s still a 9.5% p.a. increase, more than double the 4.0% increase the 
company said. How could 20% over 2 years be 4% p.a.?  ~67% of CSTE’s quartz supply 
comes from Turkey and it’s likely all suppliers increased prices by a similar percentage


Price Compression 
Leading to 
Margin Erosion 


Channel checks 
and Price Quotes


Analysts say: CSTE’s products are unique, and better marketed Company says: Nothing
We say: Margin compression highly likely;  a 25%+ pricing differential likely cannot be 
maintained. If FX didn’t move over the last few yrs, would margins still be down? 
Uniqueness comes down to design, CSTE’s designs can be replicated by competitors. 
Marketing only goes so far and will need to inc. in the future as more competition enters


Market Share May Be  
Eroding From More 
Competition


Independent 
Panjiva Import Data


Analysts and Company say: Trust Freedonia’s paid-for research (which CSTE contributed 
to). CSTE has been capacity constrained so hasn’t been able to grow imports
We say: Our data is factual and objective. Import tonnage has been flat since late 2013 
even though the Bar-Lev came fully online Q2’14. Meanwhile, foreign imports to the U.S. 
are rising. CSTE is no longer capacity constrained


Growing Liabilities to 
Silicosis Disease; Lawsuits 


Company Citations in 
Israel Health and Medical 


Associations


Analysts say: Cannot be refuted, the details are buried in the company’s 20-F
We say:  CSTE’s balance sheet may not be able to sustain adverse judgments; these 
liabilities could impair its equity value. Analysts don’t factor in potential liabilities into 
their valuations. The problem is serious enough that a TV program was aired in Israel 


Beware of 
CSTE’s Auditor


PCAOB Citations for 
Deficient Audits


Analysts and Company say: Don’t worry, there is no evidence CSTE’s audit was bad, 
financial results and accounting are perfectly fine
We say: We never said CSTE was the subject of the PCAOB audit. Let’s investigate other 
irregularities and its auditor’s past with Tefron!

A Tale of Two Georgia Countertop 
Facilities: LG vs. Caesarstone


12


According to LG, it spent ~$50m for its initial plant in 2011, and will spend an additional $40m to add a second line which 


will be completed in June 2016. The all-in cost for LG’s facilities and line equipment is $90m or $40m (30%) less than CSTE’s 


project! Also CSTE reports needing to hire 50 extra full time employees by year end to run a plant with 2 production lines. 


CSTE does not disclose a detailed account of its capex spending, so it is difficult to understand the variance.

Why Is CSTE’s U.S. Plant Expansion 
30% Over-Budget?


13


• Project 30% over Budget:  CSTE told investors it estimated its initial U.S. expansion plan to cost $75m, with an additional $30m for 
a 2nd Line (Approximately $100m total cost). The cost estimate was raised to $115m in Q2’2014, and again to $130m in Q1’2015 
(the last increase came before the sales guidance cut in Q2’15)


• This high cost overrun has been attributed to a variety of factors from management. The first explanation on August 7, 2014 during 
Q2 earnings:


“The Company has decided to increase its investment in its US facility to approximately $115 million, compared to its earlier estimate
of approximately $100 million, mostly to accommodate improvements in operations, including upgraded machinery for higher 


manufacturing capacity. In addition to this investment, the Company intends to start initial steps towards establishing its second 
building in Richmond Hill to accommodate additional manufacturing capacity in the future as needed to satisfy potential demand.”


• Coincidentally, while increasing its capex estimate by $15m in Q2’14, CSTE also raised its sales guidance range for 2014 by an 
identical amount:


“Following a strong second quarter and to reflect an improvement in both inventory and manufacturing throughput, the Company 
today increased its revenue guidance for the full year of 2014 to a new range of $435 to $445 million as compared to its prior range of 
$420 million to $430 million”


• The second increase during Q1’15 earnings on May 5, 2015 from $115m to $130m was explained in more vague terms in the press 
release as “expected capital expenditure related to the first and second lines” and by the CEO on the conference call:


“With regards to the increase, it is actually a combination of a few things. There are some improvement-related investments that got 
into the project. We invested additional money to improve our environmental footprint that is extremely important. So that played 
another segment role, but there was also some partial deviation from original budget that [wasn’t budget]. So the mix of those things.”


• We attempted to verify CSTE’s claim that environmental issues may have necessitated an increase of $15m to the project. We filed
a Georgia Open Records Act request with the Georgia State Environmental Protection Division to obtain any records of env’t 
disputes, sanctions, assessments or letters of correspondence with CSTE. Our request turned up nothing of significance

Two Production Lines Estimated $60 - $80m Everything Else: $50 - $70m?


Source: Omega Construction Website


• Based on conversations with an industry expert, a 
new Breton production line costs $30 - $40m 


• Note: LG’s recently announced line addition and 
building facility expansion is estimated to cost $40m 
in Georgia just 5 hours away

Could CSTE Be Capitalizing Costs To The 
Income Statement to Overstate Earnings?


15


One possible explanation for CSTE’s repeated increase in its U.S. plant construction is 


that it could provide it an ability to capitalize operating costs on the balance sheet, 


thereby inflating its earnings. CSTE doesn’t disclose the $ amount of capitalized costs


Source: CSTE Annual Report 20-F, page F-20


“Costs recorded prior to a production line 
completion are reflected as construction in 
progress, which are recorded to Land, 
building and machinery assets at the date 
purchase. Construction in progress includes 
direct expenditures for the construction of 
the production line and is stated at cost. 
Capitalized costs include costs incurred 
under the construction contract: advisory, 
consulting and direct internal costs 
(including labor) and operating costs 
incurred during the construction and 
installation phase.”

Capex Fraud Case Study: 
American Italian Pasta (Nasdaq: AIPC)


17Source: SEC Fraud Complaint


On September 8, 2008 the SEC charged the executives at American Italian Pasta (Nasdaq: AIPC) with accounting 


fraud. According to the SEC's complaints, the fraudulent accounting and other errors arising from inadequate 


internal controls, resulted in the overstatement of AIPC's pre-tax income for the relevant period by approximately 


$59 million, or 66%. A central aspect of the fraud was capitalization of manufacturing expenses. 


From FY 2002 through the Q2’2004, AIPC fraudulently capitalized over $10 million to manufacturing assets
• AIPC had significant capital projects which typically involved additions of new pasta production lines in its manufacturing plants. The line 


installations generally were contracted to third parties under the direction of AIPC’s engineering department. When installation of a new 
line was completed, AIPC’s engineering department “commissioned” the line through a series of test runs and equipment adjustments. 
During the commissioning phase, the line produced saleable pasta in quantities that steadily increased


• Following AIPC’s IPO in 1997, AIPC did not have adequate systems for measuring the internal plant labor and other costs used on capital 
projects. Instead of implementing a suitable system, AIPC adopted a practice of capitalizing without support internal labor and other 
costs used on the projects. Under this practice, internal costs capitalized were not identified specifically and segregated from ordinary 
operating expenses and AIPC lacked compensating internal controls. 


AIPC’s senior executives fraudulently inflated capitalization to long-lived manufacturing assets in at least three ways. 
1. First, prior to FY 2002, senior executives instituted a practice of incorporating capitalization estimates into AIPC’s annual budgets. 


Thereafter, month after month, through at least FY 2003, AIPC booked, contrary to GAAP, capitalization based on its budget instead of 
on an adequate review of actual events. During FY 2002 and 2003, to reduce reported manufacturing costs, AIPC increased the amount 
of capitalization improperly booked based on its budgets


2. Second, from FY 2002 through the Q1’2004, AIPC fraudulently capitalized normal manufacturing expenses that exceeded the original 
manufacturing budget. AIPC measured spending in excess of the manufacturing budget on a plant-wide basis, rather than with respect 
to individual pasta production lines. AIPC regularly capitalized, contrary to GAAP, these plant-wide variances to the budget without 
performing adequate analysis to determine whether they related to capital projects. Further, AIPC often capitalized the variances even 
when available information indicated they were unrelated to capital projects. 


3. Third, at Profit Achievement Task Force and other meetings during FY 2002 and 2003, senior AIPC executives agreed to book specific 
amounts of additional capitalization to offset the profit impact of sales shortfalls. Contrary to GAAP, these amounts were booked 
without adequate justification and in some cases the additional costs were capitalized improperly to assets that were fully operational.

CSTE’s Unusual Financing Structure 
With Bryan County


18


“In December 2014, we entered into a bond purchase loan agreement and were 
issued a taxable revenue bond on December 1, 2014, and executed a corresponding 
lease agreement, pursuant to which the Development Authority of Bryan County, an 
instrumentality of the State of Georgia and a public corporation (“DABC”), has 
acquired legal title of our facility in Richmond Hill, in the State of Georgia, USA, 
and in consideration leased such facilities back to us. In addition, the facility was 
pledged by DABC in favor of us and DABC has committed to re-convey title to the 
facility to us upon the maturity of the bond or at any time at our request, upon our 
payment of $100 to DABC. Therefore, we consider such facilities to be owned by 
us. This arrangement was structured to grant us property tax abatement for ten 
years at 100% and additional five years at 50%, subject to our satisfying certain 
qualifying conditions with respect to headcount, average salaries paid to our 
employees and the total capital investment amount in our U.S plant.”


CSTE appears to have buried the following disclosure deep in the footnotes of its 20-F Annual 


Report. Notice that it did not reveal the size of the loan agreement or key terms but described it 


as a “lease” agreement. Although DABC has title to the facility, yet CSTE believes it owns its 


facilities and can claim property tax abatement.

Community Investment Goals Caesarstone Plant Opens in South Bryan


May 27, 2015


The first event Chris Carr attended as the head of the Georgia Department 
of Economic Development was the November 2013 groundbreaking for 
Caesarstone’s manufacturing plant in South Bryan.  Carr returned 
Wednesday as Caesarstone celebrated the grand opening of its plant in 
Belfast Commerce Centre.   “To see this wonderful facility, there is definitely 
a ‘wow’ factor here,” he said. “I wasn’t going to miss this for anything in the 
world.” The manufacturing plant is the first in the United States for 
Caesarstone, an Israeli company that produces quartz countertops. 
Caesarstone also is the first industry to build in Belfast Commerce Centre. 
The site south of Richmond Hill was chosen for the plant after Caesarstone 
spent about a year evaluating approximately 75 sites in several states, 
Development Authority of Bryan County CEO Anna Chafin said. Local leaders 
touted the proximity to the Port of Savannah and interstates, available 
workforce and “superior quality of life that’s offered in Richmond Hill and 
the Savannah area,” Chafin said.


“We have found Georgia, Bryan County — specifically, Richmond Hill — is 
the best place for us,” Caesarstone CEO Yos Shiran said.  “I think they really 
fell in love with the community, just as all of us have,” Bryan County 
Commissioners Chairman Jimmy Burnsed said in a video that was played for 
the local and state officials and Caesarstone employees gathered for the 
celebration.


The first production line is up and running, and 107 people are employed 
at the South Bryan plant, according to Shiran. A second line is expected to 
be added by the end of this year, he said, which will bring about 80 more 
workers.


Bryan County News Article


CSTE must hit hiring goals for its U.S. plant to receive tax incentives. According to CSTE, the plant is operational but producing 
immaterial amount of products, yet CSTE wants to add additional capacity by Q4’15 and hire more workers. What will these 
workers do at an idle facility?

Fundamental Challenges and 
Issues Remain
Update: Latest Import Data Signaling 
Massive Slowdown...


22


Source: Panjiva


Warning: Largest 
Monthly Drop 


Ever Recorded!


Warning: Why Didn’t CSTE cut 
guidance during this large 


2 month decline? Instead CSTE raised 
sales and capex guidance by an 


identical amount of $15m


In our initial report, we argued that U.S. imports of Caesarstone were a reliable barometer of the 


company’s quantity of slabs sold and financial performance. Caesarstone did not refute our data source or 


interpretation. We observe that the Company has had a dramatic slow down of imports into the U.S. in 


August, the largest one-month decline ever recorded and is not making up for this decline with any 


material domestic U.S. production. CSTE will face tough YoY comps in the coming quarter.

A Second Look At The Quartz Supply 
Agreements, From the Volume Perspective


24
Source: SEC exhibit filings, received under Freedom of Information Request


Notice total quantities 
of quartz ordered rose 
26% From 2012-2014 


(12.2% p.a), while 
reported COGS rose 
23.5% p.a. and Sales 


rose 22.8% p.a. over the 
same period!


Previously, we pointed out that quartz price rose by approximately double the 4% rate reported by CSTE. 


However, looking at the quantities purchased is also insightful.  Quantities purchased grew at almost half the 


rate of reported sales and COGS from 2012-2014.
Reminder: Growth Story Is Cracked, Sales 
and Margins To Remain Challenged 


25


Sales Growth Unlikely to Accelerate Margins Remain Questionable


• CSTE’s sales growth rate has declined markedly and 


we believe it will continue to decline:


• 2012-2013: sales growth: 20%


• 2013-2014: sales growth: 25%


• 2015E: sales growth (per guidance): 12%


• CSTE’s Q2’15 sales guidance reduction from 


$515-$525m to $495-$505m is the canary in the coal mine 


signaling further disappointments


• Disappointment comes despite the added Ikea distribution 


deals from 2013 and access to the DIY market


• 2016E (consensus estimate) of 18% sales growth is 


optimistic considering that:


• The Chinese Yuan devaluation just made Chinese 


imports even cheaper


• Canadian and Australian currencies remain under 


pressure (36% of sales in these countries) 


• CSTE is not levered to the multifamily housing which 


is a big driver of the U.S. housing cycle


• Import data of slabs remain under pressure


• New “super premium” category led by Dekton is 


being created and being marketed through the DIY 


channels like Home Depot


• Questions about product quality and customer 


complaints remain


• Despite cutting its sales guidance, CSTE maintained its EBITDA 


range of $123 – 129m (25.2% margin at the midpoint)


• Maintaining its EBITDA margin seems difficult in light of the 


following:


• In its SEC filing, CSTE indicated it expected quartz prices to go 


up in 2015 by a similar amount from 2014. Based on our public 


access of its key quartz supply agreement, this would imply 


another 9.5% increase in 2015. (CSTE has not indicated it has 


long-term supply agreements for its new U.S. facility)


• There is evidence of increased price competition in the quartz 


countertop market from new entrants at price points of 25% 


less. Dealer quotes support our claim of pricing pressures


• R&D expense and margins are already razor thin. Any further 


cuts to R&D could sacrifice further product innovation and 


future competitiveness


• On the Q2’15 call CSTE explains it will get an EBITDA benefit by 


lowering U.S. plant start up expense from $11m to just $1.5m as a 


result of “less pressure to ramp up.” We interpret this to mean they 


see weak customer demand


• As illustrated, if margins are evaluated on a constant currency basis, 


CSTE margins could be up to 7% less


• CSTE’s Sales and Marketing margins have fallen sharply. If they 


don’t spend more on marketing, sales growth will decline, and if they 


do market more, EBITDA margins will be impacted lower


• Open question remains about the degree of benefit from the 


related-party deals with the Kibbutz

Why Are Directors Fleeing?


26


Ram Belinkov Resigns Avner Naveh Resigns


• In a 6-K filing late on September 17th, CSTE disclosed 
that Mr. Ram Belinkov resigned from CSTE’s Board 
over a difference of opinion over matters related to 
board governance and the decision to grant the CEO 
stock options


• As an independent Director, his resignation put CSTE 
out of compliance with the Nasdaq rule requiring a 
Board consisting of a majority of Independent 
Directors


• It is noteworthy that he left the Israel Ministry of 
Finance in 2009 where he was a Budget Director over 
a difference of opinion in a budget deal 


• Combine this with the fact that he is involved as a 
Board member with other public companies (Kafrit, 
Melisron), suggests he can afford to be picky with 
which companies he’s involved with


• A quote from his former boss, Finance Ministry 
Accountant-General Shuki Oren said, “He (Belinkov) is 
an honest and courageous guy who stands up for his 
principles”


• Late on Friday, September 25th after market close, CSTE 
filed another 6-K announcing that Mr. Avner Naveh 
resigned from the Board  


• Mr. Naveh informed the Board that he was resigning due 
to a difference of opinion over matters related to the 
Board’s work and material resolutions


• However, CSTE issued a press release giving the 
appearance that his resignation was primarily to regain 
compliance with the majority Independent Director rule. 
The press release did not mention any difference of 
opinion over Board matters


• We also observe that Mr. Naveh serves as Board member 
on other public companies including Ashtrom Properties 
Ltd and Zur Shamir Holdings Ltd

Analysts Have, And We Believe Will Continue 
To Be, Wrong on CSTE’s Share Price


27


Stifel Nicolaus:  February 26, 2015 - Buy $70 Price Target 


“CSTE remains the same story today as it was when the Company IPO’d in March 2012”


“Margins have been and will continue to be buffeted by currency headwinds and the U.S. Plant expansion scheduled for 2015, 
but excluding these factors, margins are growing.”


“We think the rare combination in building products of high growth and high returns on capital will continue for the next 
several years as quartz penetrates the kitchen countertop market further and CSTE takes advantage of its superior brand, 
product quality and distribution to grow its share”


Stifel Nicolaus: May 6, 2015 – Buy $70 Price Target


“We have no fears that the building inventory portends an issue but actually the contrary as it suggests the company is slowly 
getting into a better service condition that should further improve once the U.S. capacity comes on line”


“A minor disappointment was the news of an increase in the capital spending for the two lines being closer to $130 million 
from the previous $115 million (originally, we thought each line might be as low as $50 million of capital spending). There may 
be somewhat of an offset with better speeds or quality but clearly the capital being deployed is somewhat higher than previous 
expectations.”


Stifel Nicolaus: June 17, 2015 - Buy $70 Price Target 


“A compound growth rate of 30% in calendars 2015 and 2016 seems attainable and then 2017-2018 at 25% growth would put 
the company close to $500 million in the U.S. marketplace. We think more than half of this growth comes from the overall 
penetration of quartz in the U.S. marketplace and the other 30-40% will come from share gains”


It pays to critically assess any analyst who endorses a stock and review his or her accuracy!

with facilities, manpower, management and infrastructure in China. It also provides us with an existing sales and distribution channel 
through a leading brand. We see significant long-term potential in this joint venture."

following his exercise of 150,000 options to acquire shares.


8/8/2006 Q2’2006 Earnings
(Hint of Issues 


and reasons why 
Tefron Could 
Disappoint)


"Most significantly, the increase in our revenues compared with the comparable period of last year was across all of our product lines and 
was accompanied by an improvement in both our gross and operating margins. Our swimwear product line performed stronger than we 
had expected in the first half of the year. As we move beyond the summer, we expect sales of swimwear to significantly subside in the 
third quarter and to increase again in the fourth quarter of 2006, due to the seasonality of the swimwear business.“
"To date, the (Israel) conflict, which has mainly affected the northern part of the country, has had a limited effect on our ongoing business 
and operations which are primarily located in northern Israel. However, there is a possibility that the ongoing conflict will not allow us 
to fully increase production to meet the growing demand we are seeing in our active-wear product line, which is beyond our original 
plans for the third quarter. We believe that we will achieve our previously announced target for 2006 of mid-teen percentage growth in 
revenues and profitability levels higher than those of 2005, at around the levels seen in the fourth quarter of 2005."

2/20/2007 Q4 and FY 
2006 


Earnings


"Active-wear sales were below our initial expectations for 2006 due to a shift in timing of product flows by Nike. We anticipate a temporary decline in 
active-wear sales in the first half of 2007, and a strengthening of active-wear sales in the second half of 2007 as Nike introduces its next generation of 
performance apparel. We believe our relationship with Nike is strong, and it remains a central part of our strategy driving our long-term growth in the 
active wear.“
“Overall, in the first half of 2007 we expect to see a slight decline in revenue as compared to the first half of last year due to the anticipated decline in active-
wear revenue. Additionally, we expect a temporary reduction in operating margins in the first half of the year as compared with the first half of last year, 
given the ongoing weakness of the dollar versus the Israeli shekel, as well as pricing pressure in older collections of our intimate apparel product line”


4/23/2007 Director 
Wolfson 
Resigns, 


Sells Stock


“Arie Wolfson has resigned from the board of directors of the company. Mr. Wolfson owned shares of Tefron through his shareholding in Macpell Industries 
Ltd., a company publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, where he also served as an officer. On April 19, 2007, Macpell announced that it had sold all 
of the 2,852,810 shares it held in Tefron. Accordingly, the shareholders agreement between Norfet, Macpell and Arwol was terminated.” (Note: Wolfson
elected to Board at same time Kost Forer & Gabbay of E&Y appointed auditor according to a press release)


5/7/2007 Q1’2007 
Earnings


"We continue to believe that revenues for the year will be higher than those of 2006 as a result of the expected growth in active-wear sales in the second 
half of the year. We expect our second quarter revenues to decline in approximately 12% compared to the second quarter of 2006 due to the anticipated 
temporary reduction in active-wear sales. We also expect a strengthening pressure on our operating margins given the ongoing weakening of the US 
Dollar versus the Shekel and the pricing reduction in older collections of our intimate apparel product line. To mitigate these effects we intend to 
continue to transfer labor intensive production processes offshore


7/5/2007 Mid 
Quarter 
Earnings 
Guidance 


Cut


“Tefron expects, based on preliminary data, second quarter revenues of approximately $40.5 million, representing an approximately 19% decrease from 
second quarter 2006 revenues of $49.7 million. The expected decrease is due mainly to lower than anticipated active-wear and intimate apparel sales. 
Tefron expects that third quarter revenues will further decline due to a delay in active-wear orders, as well as the seasonal reduction in sales of its 
swimwear product line”

and 
Q3’2007 
Earnings


“Tefron also announced that its contemplated joint venture in China with Langsha Knitting Co. Ltd. and Itochu Corporation has been terminated due to 
lack of progress with the Chinese partner.”
"The third quarter, in which we reported lower revenues and an operating loss, was a tough one for Tefron.... With regard to the fourth quarter, we now 
expect active-wear sales to remain at similar levels seen over the last few quarters. A large portion of these sales will be derived from our Cut & Sew 
division's 'new generation' Nike products, which have a relatively lower profitability than those of the Seamless active-wear products. However, we have 
started manufacturing seamless products for the 'new generation' which will mostly be shipped next year, and we are very excited with the prospects of this 
project. These products are technologically advanced, and they have created short-term manufacturing challenges for us...”

• Tefron IPO’ed and was listed on the NYSE in 1997. An article in Fortune from 2000 entitled “This Entrepreneur is Changing Underwear” 


highlighted some of the stock’s selling points such as fast revenue growth and marquee customers such as Victoria Secret, Calvin Klein 


and Target. The article also highlighted the upside from a patent application for a seamless bra that it called “revolutionary”


• Tefron would make numerous acquisitions and investments to expand in the U.S. such as Alba Waldenstein (Tefron USA, 1999), Macro


Clothing (2003), Sports Innovation Division (2004) and Excelsior (2008) 


• Margins would peak in 2006, which coincided with a well time stock offering by major investors, including the CEO Yos Shiran. Gross 


margin expansion was cited due to “mix of higher margin products and improvements in operating efficiencies”


• Sales plunged starting in 2007 as major customer orders ceased, and Tefron admitted that it had manufacturing issues and a cost 


structure was too high in relation to its competitors


• It is noteworthy that Tefron consistently misguided its expectations for capital expenditures each year from 2003 – 2010.

Tefron’s Failure Attributed to Poor 
Management, Quality Control Issues


37


Poor Management, Quality Control, and Execution Blamed For Tefron Failure


Source: Israeli Globe Article


Tefron moves seamlessly towards profit


January 1, 2012


Amit Meridor, CEO of the seamless clothing manufacturer, tells "Globes" that Tefron is well on the road to recovery.


A few minutes before we begin the interview with Amit Meridor, Tefron Ltd. (Bulletin Board: TFRFF; TASE:TFR) CEO for the 


last two years, we get a glimpse of a small display of clothing produced by Tefron, which helps us understand what separates 


it from other Israeli textile companies, what destroyed it three years ago, and what helped it recover over this past year.


Tefron went through the greatest crisis in its history three years ago. Poor management, which was exacerbated by 


the credit crisis, nearly drove the company to the brink of insolvency. Revenue fell, losses piled up, and the bank 


debt remained the same. 


"Tefron's main problem was execution, similar to many other Israel start-ups," Tefron CEO Meridor, 50, says, "Tefron 


developed and manufactured products, but crashed due to quality control and delivery problems. In 2009, for 


example, we paid $9 million in late fees for merchandise that failed to reach customers in the US on time. This was the 


company's sickness, a problem that has existed from the start. Last year, we only paid a few hundred thousand dollars in late


fees, which is a significant change. Tefron is finally doing what it promised to do, and is very cautious in its commitments.

Wall St. Analysts expect 18% revenue 
growth next year, but we believe it to 
be optimistic. We estimate revenue 
growth will be ~5%. Based on dealer 
conversations, we believe CSTE has 
tried to historically increase prices 2-3% 
annually. We believe they get modest 
1-2% volume growth in line with world 
GDP. In our opinion, EBITDA might be 
overstated by up to $30m from over 
capitalization of expenses


Wall St. Analysts fail to adjust CSTE’s 
valuation for the likelihood of a large 
payout due to silicosis liabilities. If we 
take management’s estimate for $56m 
of liability from the class action lawsuit 
(less $20m insurance coverage), we 
assume $34m of incremental liabilities


Given our grave concerns about the integrity of Caesarstone’s financials, management’s past results 


at Tefron, recent director resignations, weak US import data, and declining FX rates (Australian and 


Canadian Dollar), we are downgrading our price target.
