FAB Universal: Glaring Contradictions In Its 2013 10-K

Summary


On July 16th, 2014, FAB Universal (FU) will make an oral appeal to the NYSE’s April
28th, 2014 delisting decision.


Presumably FAB will try to explain how its secret $16.3 million Chinese bond offering
was not a sufficiently bad corporate governance-lapse to merit a delisting.


FAB will also have to explain how its decision to downgrade its auditor somehow
made sense given its admitted lack of internal control over its Chinese subsidiaries.


In today’s report, I analyze and expose contradictions in FAB’s new description of its
media kiosk business and question why FAB’s former auditor was unable to perform
cash balance confirmations.


On July 16th, 2014, FAB Universal (NYSEMKT:FU) will make an oral appeal to the
NYSE's April 28th, 2014, delisting decision. Presumably, FAB will try to explain how its
secret $16.3 million Chinese bond offering was not a sufficiently bad corporate
governance-lapse to merit a delisting. FAB will also have to explain how its decision to
downgrade its auditor somehow made sense given its admitted lack of internal control
over its Chinese subsidiaries. On top of all this, FAB will have to convince the NYSE that
its contradictory disclosures in its belatedly filed 2013 10-K finally paint a true picture of
FAB's Chinese business. In today's report, I analyze and expose contradictions in FAB's
new description of its media kiosk business and question why FAB's former auditor was
unable to perform cash balance confirmations


Is FAB a Provider and Operator of Media Kiosks or a Seller of Technology
Licenses?


In Note 1 to FAB's 2012 audited financials in its 2012 10-K FAB described its core Chinese
business as follows:

"[FAB]'s products and services are primarily distributed through its flagship stores,
wholesale services, proprietary 'FAB' kiosks, and online virtual stores. FAB kiosks,
located in high-traffic areas of office buildings, shopping malls, retail stores and
airports, are self-service terminals that provide a range of entertainment and
consumer applications."


"FAB Media was incorporated as a private enterprise in the PRC in April 2008 with a
registered capital of RMB 1 million. FAB Media is primarily engaged in operating and
providing proprietary multimedia kiosks for music downloads, information exchange
and advertising." (Page 49)


FAB claimed to be responsible for the placement and location of the media kiosks, which
FAB refers to as "our Kiosks" in the following risk factor related to FAB's business
disclosed in the 2012 10-K:


"Our failure to maintain existing relationships or obtain new relationships that
allow us to place our Kiosks in desirable locations would harm our business
and prospects."


"Our ability to generate revenues from Kiosks depends largely upon our ability to
provide licensees networks of Kiosks in desirable locations throughout major urban
areas in China. This, in turn, requires that we develop and maintain business
relationships with real estate developers, landlords, property managers,
hypermarkets, retailers, and other businesses and locations in which we are
provided space for our facilities. If we fail to maintain our relationships with landlords
and property managers, or if a significant number of our existing Kiosks placement
agreements are terminated or not renewed or if we fail to maintain our relationship
with our location provider, licensees may find our networks unattractive and may not
renew agreement after the termination of five years agreement, which would cause
our revenues to decline and our business and prospects to deteriorate." (Page 13)


Recall that in my December 9th, 2013 report, I announced that I was only able to locate 20
of the 3,954 media kiosks FAB claimed to have installed in Beijing alone. All FAB had to
do was publish a detailed list of its Beijing media kiosk locations. FAB did not do this and I
believe FAB could not do this because the kiosks simply do not exist.


So rather than simply publishing the locations of the media kiosks, FAB revised its entire
business model in its delinquently filed 2013 10-K (filed June 27th, 2014). FAB removed
all the previous references to the number of media kiosks installed or deployed in China.

Instead, FAB now states that the kiosk business merely involves the sale of "FAB brand
licenses:"


"FAB has grown its business through its licensing and regional agent programs and
has sold 17,944 brand licenses, which allows the licensees to use FAB's brand on
the kiosks."


"FAB generates revenues from the sale of FAB Brand licenses, as well as
advertising, and FAB membership card sales." (Page 32)


This seems to be a bold act of recanting the previously disclosed business model (in every
single public announcement related to Wizzard's acquisition of FAB up until now) and
recasting it in a new, albeit equally dubious direction. The first hint of this change in
business description appeared in FAB's December 10th, 2013 announcement that its
Board of Directors had taken the time to review thousands of "licenses to operate kiosks."
In this same press release, FAB also reiterated that 3,954 media kiosks had been
deployed in Beijing. With the absence of any mention of deployments in the new 10-K,
FAB has taken an unconvincing but decisive step toward being able to disavow any
knowledge of the location of the kiosks. The bottom line is that "FAB brand licenses" for
kiosks that FAB cannot prove exist are simply meaningless. Where are the kiosks?


Turning back to FAB's historical filings, let's not forget that FAB in fact described its media
kiosk licensing program in great detail in the June 1st, 2012 Proxy, which again showed
that FAB was in complete control of the location and operation of all the media kiosks:


"FAB licensing program is a merchant program that binds the FAB and each small
investor or vendor. Under this program and associated contract, both licensor and
licensee take their joint-business obligations as follows:


1. The licensee pays for FAB Kiosk and other equipment and fixtures while the
licensor (FAB Media) is responsible for the complete set-up of each FAB outlet
from the location selection to construction or conversion, remodeling and
equipment installation.


2. All FAB outlets will be owned by the licensee, but supervised by a designated
management company - Beijing Huzhong Culture Co., Ltd ("Huzhong Culture") in
accordance with FAB's distinctive business formats.


3. FAB kiosks are linked to the server station through the internet to remain
updated. Such maintenances are operated by Huzhong Culture." (Page 35)

The 2012 10-K also confirmed that the media kiosks are networked:


"The content is contained on internal hard drives within each terminal thereby
eliminating bandwidth download problems associated with the internet and providing
content owners with a secure closed system for digital file protection and accurate
transparent accounting. The terminals are updated and monitored via web-linked
electronic communications." (Page 29)


Based on these and other 2012 disclosures in its SEC filings, FAB explicitly portrayed as
fact that it owns and/or operates a vast network of thousands of media kiosks. FAB's
licensees invested in thousands of the media kiosks, which were located in places FAB
selected, built out, and maintained. FAB (via a related party known as Huzhong)
supervised the media kiosks in operation, and the media kiosks were networked to a
central server.


However, in its delinquently filed 2013 10-K, FAB makes no mention of the kiosks being
"networked" to a central server and even removes all mention of FAB's provision of
"desirable locations" for kiosk placements "throughout major urban areas of China," as it
repeatedly stated in the past filings and public announcements.


Further, FAB makes a deceitful attempt to "backdate" the 2013 10-K business description
changes to 2010:


"Prior to 2010, the Company's business model consisted of brand licensing and
agreements that allowed for the purchase and operation of kiosks under the FAB
brand. After 2010, the Company only sold license agreements which were outside of
Beijing." (Page 3)


FAB's purported 2010 change to its business model is contradicted by my research that
found that as recently as late 2013, FAB's Beijing kiosk franchising sales office was still
offering media kiosks to Chinese investors on a turnkey basis - whereby FAB was
responsible for placing and operating the kiosks and guaranteed franchisees a positive
return on their investments.


FAB also suspiciously discloses in the 2013 10-K that only "some kiosks" have media
download capabilities:

"The Kiosks provide a variety of functions, and some provide multiple functions. The
great majority of the kiosks generate revenue from the sale of advertising. Some
kiosks are ATM style terminals where consumers can download content directly to
their cell phones, memory sticks or other mobile storage devices. Others provide
directions or other services or offer coupons or other goods for sale." (Page 3)


Contrast the 2013 10-K statement with FAB's June 1st, 2012 proxy that described the
standard kiosk as having media download capabilities:


"The standard FAB kiosks have the following features:


· The user can review and select a variety of licensed music, movies, mobile phone
ringtones and games from a touch screen.


· The user can stream the selected content or titles to different kinds of portable
devices, such as, MP3, MP4, memory cards, hard disks, flash disks, mobile
phones." (Page 35)


FAB's new claim that only "some kiosks" are media kiosks indicates to me that the true
number of media kiosks in Beijing is not much more than the 20 I found in my
investigation. This further explains FAB's reluctance to disclose the media kiosk locations.


The Auditor Downgrade - Why Did Management Not Let Friedman Verify $100
Million Purported Cash Balance?


Through April 30th, 2014, the date of FAB's dismissal of its auditor (Friedman):


"(A) due to the time requirements placed on management because of an internal
investigation (the "Internal Investigation") being conducted by an outside
independent consulting firm at the same time as the audit, Company personnel were
not readily available to assist Friedman in completion of certain audit procedures, (B)
certain requests for additional documentation and procedures were not complied
with, and (C) Friedman was unwilling to express an opinion on the Company's
financial statements prior to the completion of the Internal Investigation and prior to
the confirmation of bank balances at certain depository institutions in China,…"


From this disclosure, it is apparent that as of April 30th, 2014, Friedman had not verified
FAB's December 31st, 2013 bank balances of $99,077,811. The excuse that FAB's
management personnel were unavailable to assist Friedman to verify bank balances is
