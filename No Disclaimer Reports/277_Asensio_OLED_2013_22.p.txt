Muddy Waters, LLC confirms that it reviewed the SAIC file for the correct Orient Paper, Inc. 
(“ONP”) entity.  We stand by our statements of fact and conclusions. 


We have read June 30, 2010 press release response to our report initiating coverage on ONP with 
a Strong Sell.  Despite ONP’s response, our thesis that ONP is a fraud remains unchanged, and 
we reiterate our “Strong Sell” rating on ONP’s shares.   


Our view is that the report we issued is a compilation of open secrets in both Chinese and English.  
There are significant amounts of conflicting information available in both languages. 


The crux of ONP’s press release is that we identified the wrong company as ONP’s operating 
subsidiary in China (“HBOP”).  Our review of our files confirms that we previously studied the 
correct entity, and thus all of our conclusions in the report are valid.  The HBOP documents we 
reviewed are for 河北省保定 市东方造纸有限公司 (the “Entity”). 


• As of our first review date, the most recent business license for the Entity had been issued 
on April 11, 2006.   


o The Legal Representative listed on the Entity’s business license is刘振勇 
(Zhenyong Liu).   


o The registered capital is RMB 75.03 million.   
o The “scope of business” of the Entity is: manufacturing of writing paper, 


corrugated paper, packing/wrapping paper, managing the company’s export of 
self-manufactured products and technology, managing the company’s import of 
raw materials, machinery and equipment, spare parts and technology, with the 
exception of products and technology restricted or prohibited by the 
government or prohibited for import/export. 


• The capital verification report for the Entity dated March 27, 2003 (see our initial report 
pp. 11-12) shows its registered capital ownership breakdown as follows:  


o Zhenyong Liu 93.26% 
o Xiaodong Liu (Chairman Liu’s brother) 6.61% 
o Shuangxi Zhao 0.13% 


• ONP’s SEC filings corroborate this name of the Entity.  In Exhibit 10.5 to its amended 
Form 10-Q filed on February 1, 2010, ONP attached a (Short Term) Credit Facility 
Extension Agreement between HBOP and United Commercial Bank 
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1358190/000114544310000219/d26110_ex1
0-5.htm).   The borrower in the bilingual loan document dated January 23, 2009 is河北
省保定 市东方造纸有限公司.  That is the same company as the Entity (see above).  
(It would not be possible to have two such companies with identical names.  In addition, 
Chairman Liu owns the Entity, which would make for an interesting coincidence.)  
Therefore, we are able to establish that the Muddy Waters, LLC files and the ONP SEC 
filings refer to the same PRC entity. 


• The “smoking gun” document Muddy Waters, LLC reviewed showing the audited PRC 
financial results and balance sheet totals filed with the local Administration of Industry
and Commerce (dated March 24, 2009) is for the Entity.  It shows the following 2008 
financial information: 


o Revenue of RMB 16,320,687.26 ($2.4 million) 
o Taxes paid of RMB 308,831.67 (forty-five thousand dollars) 
o Net loss of RMB 2,861,941.41 (loss of four hundred nineteen thousand dollars) 
o Net assets of RMB 165,868,258.64 ($24.3 million) 
o Debt of RMB 122,721,322.31 ($18.0 million) 
o This document has the personal seal of Zhenyong Liu 


• In the press release, ONP directed investors to the website of the He Bei Administration 
of Industry and Commerce to support its allegations that our statements regarding its 
2008 audited financial statements are false.  At ONP’s urging, we accessed the site.  
For 2008, the site only contains balance sheet data.  The balance sheet shown on the 
AIC website is a good deal larger than the one with Zhenyong Liu’s personal seal in the 
AIC registration file when we accessed it.  The website shows 2008 balance sheet 
figures of: 


o Net assets of RMB 360,068,589.63 ($52.7 million) 
o Debt of RMB 127,695,341.45 ($18.7 million) 


• On the AIC website, we were able to also view 2009 financial results, which state that 
ONP’s 2009 results were as follows:  


o Revenue of RMB 698,746,829.03 ($102.3 million) 
o Net profit of RMB 93,267,670.36 ($13.7 million) 
o Net assets of RMB 456,857,752.88 ($66.9 million) 
o Debt of RMB 131.2 million ($19.2 million)  


• The hardcopy with Zhenyong Liu’s personal seal accessed at an earlier date stands in 
contrast to the online documents now presented.   
 


Our thesis remains unchanged: that ONP is a fraud and thus we maintain our “Strong Sell” rating 
in light of the following items we detailed in our initial research report (to read that report, click 
here): 


• Qinyang is incapable of producing a 5.6 m corrugating production line with 360,000 tons 
annual capacity and selling for $27.8 million.   


o Rather, its largest such line produces approximately 150,000 tons annually and 
sells for $4.4 million.   


o This is consistent with the prices and capacities of equipment produced by four 
other Chinese manufacturers, and their (as well as Qinyang’s) assessments that 
no domestic manufacturer is capable of producing such a line with annual 
capacity in excess of 200,000 tons. 


• Shuang Xing had assets worth no more than $400,000, which ONP claims to have 
acquired for $13.6 million. 


• The level of activity we witnessed at ONP was far less and on a much smaller scale than 
that of a factory producing at a rate of 212,500 tons per year.   


o There would be over 100 trucks in and out of the factory per day, with a line of 
trucks waiting to load.
o We only saw the one truck, idling with a full bed, that is shown in TheStreet.com 
video during our 90 minute visit.   


o We saw nothing that would indicate ONP actually has the 600 workers it claims 
(along with the approximately $1 million liability that would carry). 


• Our due diligence shows that it is implausible for nine of ONP’s claimed 2009 Top 10 
customers to purchase from ONP in the volumes it claims.   


• Our due diligence confirmed that in two cases in 2008, ONP’s claim about the amount of 
paper that the customer purchased was far in excess of the customer’s stated revenue.   


• Moreover, it would be almost miraculous for ONP to change eight of its top 10 2008 
customers in 2009 (while keeping the entry level to the list constant) and still grow 
overall revenue 62.5%.  If ONP’s claims and numbers were true, it would mean that it 
churns and burns its customers. 


• Our check of the values listed of five higher ticket items in the March 27, 2003 capital 
verification report of the Entity shows that the 2003 values of the assets listed are over 
four times greater than the prices we received (without negotiation) for brand new 
assets in 2010.   


• The two production lines we (along with the correspondent from TheStreet.com) saw 
were old and poorly maintained.  The report contains pictures and links to 
TheStreet.com video that corroborate this assessment.  A salesman for a large European 
manufacturer of papermaking production lines with significant experience selling into 
the China market estimated that each line was worth “a few hundred thousand dollars.”  
The photos of production lines of ONP’s claimed “main competitors” and of that of 
ONP make clear that ONP’s equipment and processes are poor.  The photos also show 
abundant steam and water in the workshop that make it clear ONP produces paper for 
customers who do not care about quality. 


• ONP’s inventory number is overstated because the raw material costs are not credible, 
and per our tour and conversation with Chairman Liu ONP actually has no finished 
goods inventory. 


• ONP’s inventory turn claims of 32.5 times and 16.8 times in 2008 and 2009, respectively, 
are without credibility when compared to the inventory turns of industry leaders (4.3 to 
7.7 times). 


• Our comps database of corrugating medium producers shows that the average production 
cost was $383 / ton in Q1 2010.  (These producers do make a higher quality product 
than does ONP.)  In early February 2010, ONP quoted a trading company a sale price 
of $264 / ton for corrugating medium.  Particularly given the poor state of ONP’s 
equipment and operations, we do not see how it could maintain gross margins 
comparable to those of the industry leaders – especially at $264 / ton. 


• ONP improperly consolidated HBOP’s claimed results, and misled investors into 
believing that ONP owned HBOP, for 16 months after going public.
