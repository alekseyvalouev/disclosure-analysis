Who Really Owns the Ping
Yi Mine: L&L Energy (LLEN)
or a Private Chinese
Investment Group?
January 13, 2012 By GeoTeam


In recent months, things have been pretty bad for Chinese
coal company L&L Energy (LLEN). There have been public
allegations of fraud, mine shutdowns and falling profits.
The only bright spot has been the company’s valuation,
which has stayed quite high relative to the rest of the
China RTO sector (~$100 million market cap). As bad as
things seem for LLEN, it could get much worse. That’s
because the GeoTeam recently uncovered evidence that
appears to indicate that LLEN does not own and never
acquired the Ping Yi Mine. LLEN claims in its SEC filings
that it acquired the Ping Yi Mine in January of 2010 and
that the mine contributed close to 40% of the company’s
total coal production for the financial year ended on April
30, 2011.


Red Flag Alert Summary


The SAIC file of the Ping Yi Mine shows that the Ping
Yi Mine is currently held by a private investment
group, rather than the LLEN subsidiary, Fuyuan
County Baoxing Economic & Trade Co., Ltd., the
company identified as the acquirer of the mine
in SEC disclosures.
In a truly mind-blowing development, this investment
group has put the Ping Yi mine up for sale during
the second half of 2011. There are multiple readily

navigable web links in China that address the sale of
the mine:


China Mining Industry Consulting Network, (see
also, English translated page)
Global Mineral Resources Network, (see also,
English translated page)
My Coal Network, (see also, English translated
page)


The SAIC file we obtained with the official chop of
Guizhou Province SAIC Office clearly shows that LLEN
is not the owner of the Ping Yi Mine and that the
current owners of Ping Yi Mine are Mr. Zhang Baoguo
(40%), Mr. Hu Shiwei (30%), Mr. Liu Shuangyou
(16%) and Mr. Chen Honglin (14%). Ping Yi Mine is a
partnership and Mr. Hu Shiwei is the legal
representative and executive partner of the Ping Yi
mine. Based on our knowledge, these four individuals
are not relevant to LLEN.
The company claims in its SEC filings that it paid
$3.96MM to acquire the Ping Yi Mine. If the company
never, in fact, bought the mine, then where did
that money go? Who has it?
To our knowledge this is the first instance that anyone
has challenged LLEN’s ownership interest in the Ping
Yi Mine.
Recall that on August 2  2011 Glaucus Research
challenged the ownership of DaPuAn Mine and the
SuTsong Mine, reporting that LLEN did not own the
DaPuAn Mine and the SuTsong Mine. Based on the
associated SEC file, Ping Yi Mine (245,547 ton),
DaPuAn Mine (245,545 ton) and ShuTsong Mine
(122,081 ton) jointly contributed almost 100% of
LLEN’s total coal production for the financial year
ended on April 30, 2011.
In a separate development, we learned that the
DaPuAn Mine, which LLEN claims had contributed
close to another 40% of the company’s coal
production in the financial year ended on April 30,
2011, has reportedly been completely shut downown

(See also, English translated page) since Nov. 22,
2011 due to a mine disaster in that area. Based on
our knowledge, it has yet to resume production
activities.
Remember that in 2011, despite numerous public and
private pleas from shareholders, LLEN has yet to
upgrade its auditor from ‘Kabani & Co’ to a more
reputable top 10 firm or even a top 100 firm.
Could the information we just revealed be why? These
latest developments show why it’s so important for
companies to retain a reputable auditor to ask the
tough questions to potentially find what we have
found.


We have taken a short position in LLEN’s common
shares. We believe that LLEN’s stock is not investable as
investors become aware of these extremely troubling
developments. As always, we will continue our research
into the issue and will update our readers with
developments.


On a side note:


GeoInvesting made repeated and good faith efforts to set
up a meeting or phone call with chief executive Dickson
Lee at a place or time of his choosing, but to no avail. Lee’s
initial willingness to discuss GeoInvesting’s findings soon
transformed into a tedious game of delay, involving even
more assistants who made more phone calls and sent more
E-mails. Ultimately, L&L demanded we write down our
findings and questions, indicating to us that Dickson just
didn’t have time to speak to us.


Well, here are our questions:


Who owns the Ping Yi Mine?
Why is it up for sale by an investment group with no
apparent ties to LLEN?

If LLEN does not own the Ping Yi Mine, where did the
$3.96 million really go?
Is it true that the DaPuAn Mine has been shut down
since late November? The company states in its most
recent 10Q that there has been a “slowdown” at the
mine. A “slowdown” is different from a shutdown.
Which is it?


We sincerely hope that Dickson Lee and the members of
LLEN’s management team can free up some time to
address these important questions.
