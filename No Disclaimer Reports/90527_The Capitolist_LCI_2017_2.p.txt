We see evidence of collusion between the generics manufactures.


We believe that the DOJ is motivated to finalize indictments at the end of an
administration and the Bloomberg story (linked below) in likely accurate.


We believe that a republican appointee to the Food and Drug Administration is
likely to encourage the approval of generic products – which will damage the
company’s ability to.

Lannett (NYSE:LCI) stated on its most recent conference call that its "internal
investigation" showed no evidence that the company engaged in collusion with its rivals
regarding generic drug pricing. No doubt this was in response to the Bloomberg article
and the subsequent slide in share price. While the Bloomberg article points out that the
authorities have ample reason to examine Digoxin pricing - we have found a few other
examples of oddly similar pricing behavior that suggests there may be more to look at
over time (to be fair, it's unknown if any of these examples are intertwined in the case
mentioned by Bloomberg). In addition to the pending charges we are similarly
concerned about the viability of the business model over time, which seems to be a buy
and price hike model dependent on drug shortages and the total lack of competition in
specific products.


Near Term Risk: DOJ Investigation(s) Into Collusion


Digoxin is the obvious (and well reported) culprit, as you can see below a Wolters
Kluwer Price Rx search reveals Impax Labs (IPXL) matching Lannett's price increase
after just a few days. All future entrants in the market also "price match" their WAC to
the new high bid, so one has to question where the competition exists in this market.

Now let's look at Levothyroxine, in this case Mylan (MYL) gets the ball rolling with
consecutive price increases in 2013 and 2014 that are both matched within days by LCI
and Sandoz. Levothyroxine is not a new product (first synthesized in the 1920's) but
because of the cozy pricing relationship displayed by the three generic competitors this
remains a multi $100m generics market. Again one has to question the value of
competition.

Finally Ursodiol, in this case LCI leads the price higher and Sandoz indexes up a few
months later - obviously Mylan is last to the party here but eventually joins ranks at the
beginning of 2016.

Our initial conclusion: The DOJ likely has a case against the industry in digoxin - but that
there are many other potential targets to discuss. We do no think the status quo is
sustainable and the action by the DOJ may break down the final vestiges of "loose"
collusion that cause the price matching behavior. Thus we expect to see a steady state
of decline in virtually all generic assets over the next few quarters (in addition to the
fines associated with the charges we think will be filed).


It's important for us to highlight that we believe the DOJ is highly motivated to get long
running cases filed as indictments (this is true for VRX as well). Specifically in cases
where large amounts of time and money have been spent. The employees do not know
if they are going to want to work for the next administration (in some cases asked to
remain in place) or if the next administration will be as aggressive in certain areas as the
current one is. Although an incoming AG can "re-task" federal assets in regards to
investigative priorities it is much less likely that they re-task resources from current
prosecutions.


Long Duration Risk: Increased Generic Approvals Will Damage Price Gougers

We refer to this as "long duration risk" as a bit of a jest - these company's have no long
duration assets. However, LCI's business is levered as though they believe the assets
have an indefinite lifespan. Over the last year they have established themselves as a
serial price raiser in order to keep up with expectations. Most recently the company
reported Q3 where virtually all assets experienced a net pricing decrease but in order to
save the quarter an Anti-psychotic experienced a 556% price increase.


At the beginning of 2016 Oppenheimer wisely pointed out that LCI enacted a 1,900%
price increase for fluphenazine HCL on top of a 220% price increase for terbutaline
sulfate.

its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and

metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the


Final Conclusions: We see LCI as another example of a levered spec pharma
company that is dependent on price to continue operations. In addition to the potential
fines from the DOJ related to the collusion probe we would expect a corporate integrity
agreement to be put in place (which would serve to further hamper the behavior). In
addition to that we see the increased pressure from Washington on the FDA to release
more generics as a real threat to pricing power over the long haul.
