Update:	Supercom's	Q3	Results	Confirm	Key	Points	Of	My	Bear
Thesis
Nov.	4,	2014	10:14	AM	ET39	comments
by:	Jay	Yoon


Summary


During	their	Q3	earnings	call,	Supercom	management	indicated	that	the	source	of
the	Companyâ€™s	recurring	revenue	is	primarily	from	follow-on	contracts.


Follow-on	contracts	should	not	be	considered	annual	recurring	revenue	because	the
timing	and	amount	of	the	follow-on	order	is	not	clearly	defined.


Based	on	YTD	results,	revenue	from	existing	customers	has	continued	to	decline
drastically.	This	indicates	that	follow-on	contracts	tend	to	decline	significantly	in
value	over	time.


Overall,	the	Q3	results	and	management	comments	further	support	my	bear	thesis
on	the	Company.


Supercom	remains	significantly	overvalued	at	the	current	share	price.


Supercom	(NASDAQ:SPCB)	released	its	Q3	2014	earnings	report	on	Monday	morning.
This	quarter's	results	and	management's	comments	from	the	earnings	call	strongly
support	the	bear	thesis	from	my	previous	article.	The	Q3	results	were	generally	in-line	with
expectations	with	revenue	of	$9.1mm	slightly	below	consensus	estimates	and	EPS	of
$0.30	above	estimates	by	$0.07	.	Although	there	were	no	big	surprises	in	terms	of
reported	revenue	and	earnings,	SPCB's	Q3	results	provided	some	answers	to	key
questions	that	bulls	and	bears	have	been	debating	about	the	Company's	recurring
revenue	streams.


During	the	Q3	earnings	call,	management	stated	the	following	during	their	opening
remarks:


"After	the	implementation	is	completed,	we	typically	receive	between	20%	to	30%	of
the	contract	value	as	recurrent	revenue	annually.	This	is	additional	to	the	initial	stated
amount.	We	currently	receive	such	recurrent	revenue	from	contracts	previously
implemented	by	both	SuperCom	and	SmartID,	as	reflected	in	our	Q1	and	Q2
revenues."

According	to	the	bolded	portions	of	management's	comments,	the	recurring	revenue	that
SPCB	receives	annually	from	previously	implemented	contracts	is	reflected	in	their	Q1
and	Q2	revenues.	With	this	in	mind,	I	have	provided	below	a	breakout	of	the	Company's
1H	2014	revenue:


As	can	be	seen	in	the	figure	above,	the	vast	majority	of	the	Company's	revenues	from
existing	customers	in	Q1	and	Q2	was	from	follow-on	contracts.	Since	management	stated
that	the	20%	-	30%	recurrent	portion	of	contracts	was	reflected	in	the	Q1	and	Q2	results,	it
can	be	concluded	that	most	of	the	Company's	recurring	revenue	is	actually	from	follow-on
contracts.	Follow-on	contracts	are	not	truly	recurring	revenue	because	follow-on	contracts
tend	to	be	a	year	or	less	in	length.	In	addition	to	this,	the	amount	and	timing	of	follow-on
orders	can	be	unpredictable.	Thus,	SPCB's	actual	amount	of	annual	recurring	revenue	is
much	lower	than	has	been	previously	portrayed	by	some	contributors	on	Seeking	Alpha.	It
can	also	be	concluded	that	recurring	revenue	from	the	$25mm	contract	signed	in	March
and	$22mm	contract	signed	in	August	will	likely	come	from	follow-on	contracts.


The	Company's	reliance	on	follow-on	contracts	would	not	be	a	big	concern	if	the	amount
of	these	follow-on	orders	was	consistent	or	growing	on	a	year-to-year	basis.	This,
however,	is	not	the	case.	I	have	provided	below	a	breakout	of	the	Company's	revenue
between	existing	customers	from	contracts	signed	prior	to	FY	2014	and	new	customers
from	contracts	signed	in	FY	2014.

My	estimate	for	revenue	from	existing	customers	in	FY	2014	is	based	on	the	Company's
YTD	Q3	results.	In	the	first	nine	months	of	FY	2014,	the	Company	reported	$21.5mm	of
revenue.	I	estimate	that	$11.5mm	of	that	amount	is	from	implementation	work	for	new
contracts	($10mm	of	revenue	from	March	2014	contract,	$1.5mm	of	revenue	from	August
contract).	$11.5mm	of	revenue	from	new	customers	implies	that	$10mm	of	the	Company's
revenue	for	YTD	Q3	2014	is	from	existing	customers.	By	annualizing	$10mm	of	YTD
revenue,	I	estimate	that	SPCB	will	generate	$13.3mm	of	revenue	from	existing	customers
in	FY	2014.	This	represents	a	31%	decline	in	revenue	from	existing	customers	compared
to	FY	2013	and	a	64%	decline	compared	to	FY	2010!	Thus,	it	can	be	concluded	that
revenue	from	existing	customers	(follow-on	contracts)	tends	to	decline	substantially	and
consistently	from	year-to-year.	Given	the	tendency	of	follow-on	revenue	to	decline	over
time	and	the	EID	industry	headwinds	which	I	mentioned	in	my	prior	article,	it	appears	likely
that	revenues	will	decline	by	a	meaningful	amount	from	FY	2014	levels.


In	summary,	SPCB's	Q3	results	provided	confirmation	that	many	investors	were	mistaken
in	their	belief	that	the	Company	generates	a	high	proportion	of	annual	recurring	revenue.
Instead,	the	Company's	receives	most	of	its	revenue	from	existing	customers	via	follow-on
contracts	which	tend	to	decline	significantly	in	value	over	time.	Thus,	the	Company's
financial	performance	is	likely	to	decline	from	FY	2014	levels.	Even	with	the	recent	drop	in
share	price,	I	believe	that	SPCB	is	still	significantly	overvalued,	and	I	recommend	shorting
SPCB	at	the	current	share	price.
