Concept: 
1. Bulls expect ARCB revenues to increase Y/Y in 2019. However, ARCB is losing volume 
share. Revenues over the last few quarters have increased only due to price increases. If pricing 
power abates, ARCB’s fundamental problems could be exposed. 
2. ARCB is under investing in its core business, indicating that management may be skeptical 
about ARCB’s longer-term prospects. Profitability in its brokerage business, 30% of revenue, 
has declined.  
3. ARCB faces a competitive threat from Amazon Logistics, which does not appear to be 
recognized by the “street”. This competition could erode ARCB’s market share, revenue and 
profitability. 
4. ARCB has substantial potential pension liabilities that are not well understood. These off-
balance sheet obligations could easily wipe out ARCB’s equity in the not very distant future. 
 
Summary: Fort Smith, Arkansas, based ArcBest Corporation (ARCB) provides 
LTL (less-than-truckload) and logistics services. The company is the 7th largest 
LTL provider in the US with a market share of about 5%.  The LTL segment, ABF 
Freight, which is asset heavy, accounts for 70% of revenues and 80% of EBITDA. 
Within LTL, 30% of the business is based on base tariffs subject to annual rate 
adjustments. The remaining 70% of the LTL business is a combination of spot 
pricing and prices negotiated individually with customers at various times 
throughout the year.  
 


The asset-light arm, which consists of a logistics group called ArcBest and a 
roadside assistance and commercial fleet maintenance management service called 
FleetNet, generates the remaining 30% of revenues, but just 20% of EBITDA. 
 
 ARCB shares are up 38% YTD, far outperforming its peers. The majority of 
the outperformance came in May, when the company announced that it had signed 
a new five-year contract with the Teamsters Union, which represents 82% of the 
employees of ABF Freight. Bulls argue that this new agreement raises annual wage 
and benefit costs at a lower rate (~2%) than feared previously, and thus could 
improve future operating ratios (which is defined as operating expenses as a 
percentage of operating revenues). 
 
 Bullish optimism regarding ARCB’s outlook appears to overlook several of 
ARCB’s problems. ARCB’s revenue growth in the last year has benefited from 
price changes it implemented in August 2017. The new shipping rates were based 
on both space and weight to ensure that the rapidly growing volumes of lighter but 
bulkier e-commerce shipments were still profitable to carry. However, shipment 
volumes have actually decreased since the rate increase, and daily shipments were 
actually down 6% Y/Y in Q2 18, and were down 2% Y/Y in the first two months 
of Q3 18 (i.e., in July 2018 and August 2018).
3 


 More recently, a higher proportion of ARCB’s business appears to be 
transactional. Industry observers have noted that LTL pricing has increased since 
Fall 2017 due to demand arising from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma as well as from 
higher economic activity resulting from the corporate tax cuts. Facing these higher 
costs, shippers seem inclined to pay higher spot prices (which we estimate were up 
~30%-50% Y/Y in Q2 18) rather than sign contracts at the higher rates, betting that 
the demand-supply imbalance could be resolved in their favor over the next few 
quarters. In our opinion, this could be a smart bet as Y/Y increases in spot prices 
have started to falter, as we discuss later. Given that the company also appears to 
be losing market share, inability to generate price increases would pressure 
ARCB’s operating income and cash flow. 
 
 Next, ARCB is a high cost LTL provider. Its operating ratio in Q2 18 was 
92.6%. Operating ratios for competitors Old Dominion Freight (ODFL) and SAIA 
were 78.7% and 90.3%, respectively, in the quarter. Despite similar salary, wage 
and benefit expenses in the quarter as its peers, ARCB’s purchased transportation 
expenses as a percentage of revenue (11.3%) in Q2 18 were markedly higher than 
those of ODFL (2.5%) and SAIA (8.0%). The latter two have noted that they have 
tried to minimize purchased transportation costs by better utilizing their network 
and assets. ARCB may be using purchased transportation as an alternative to hiring 
union workers, since it may be costly to terminate them if demand weakens in the 
future. 
 


ODFL and SAIA have spent more on expanding and improving the service 
center network and upgrading to newer, more fuel-efficient fleet in the last few 
years than has ARCB. Perhaps, this is why they have been able to more efficiently 
utilize their network to minimize transportation costs. ODFL and SAIA have spent 
an average of 14% and 13%, respectively, of revenues on capex in the last three 
years (2015-2017) compared to 6% for ARCB. Moreover, ODFL and SAIA have 
signaled that their Y/Y capex would increase 45% and 22%, respectively in 2018, 
well above the 7% Y/Y increase forecast by ARCB. ARCB’s conservative 
spending plan suggests a lack of confidence in its long-term revenue growth 
prospects, which we share.  
  


Third, ARCB appears to be losing market share because it has reduced LTL 
service terminal capacity. Over the last ten years, the number of ARCB’s service 
terminals is down 12% from 279 to 245. ODFL has increased terminals in the same 
timespan by 19% and gained share. ARCB’s LTL revenue per terminal of $8.1M 
in 2017 is the lowest in its peer group, well below the average figure of $12.4M. 


 
Fourth, LTL trucking demand could be approaching a peak. In response to 


rising transportation costs, shippers are bringing more freight handling in house, 
increasing the number of trucking fleets they utilize, and redesigning their supply
4 


chains to minimize transportation costs. For instance, Hormel noted in its FQ3 18 
(period ended July 29) earnings call on August 23 that it is maximizing truck 
utilization and minimizing frequency of delivery. Dollar General is expanding its 
private fleet and expanding and diversifying its carrier base to reduce freight costs.  
Moreover, industry observers note that freight softens seasonally in July. Finally, 
ARCB anniversaried the implementation of the space-based cubic minimum 
charges in August 2018, which should pressure future yield increases. 


 
Fifth, profitability of the ArcBest asset-light segment declined Y/Y in Q2 18 


because of increased purchased transportation costs. Historically, the results of this 
segment have been volatile because of the company’s lack of control over 
purchased transportation costs. Even as the company attempts to grow this 
segment, the inability to control purchased transportation costs is likely to affect 
segment earnings. We note that the company is attempting to grow revenue while 
limiting its own investment. If this happens, incremental margins, and operating 
margins, should decline. 


 
Sixth, the Amazon Relay program, launched in the fall of 2017, threatens to 


reduce ABF’s regional LTL trucking business. The regional LTL business ships to 
destinations up to 1,000 miles away from the pickup origin and accounted for 60% 
of 2017 ABF Freight tonnage. Amazon Relay, which has ordered 55k trailers and 
has already taken delivery of 10,000 trailers, is hiring independent truckers with 
fleets of 10-40 trucks each to move goods in Amazon trailers between points that 
are 500 miles or less apart. This arrangement is attracting truckers by offering them 
higher rates, shorter routes, and less onerous physical handling responsibilities 
versus what national and regional operators offer. AMZN aims to increase internal 
share of AMZN’s shipping business from 21% today to 65% in the next few years, 
displacing existing carriers and brokers. If this effort were successful, ABF 
Freight’s regional LTL business is likely to lose business.  


 
Finally, ARCB faces a not well-understood and significant pension problem, 


unlike its non-union peers, such as ODFL and SAIA. The company contributes 
~$80M annually to the Central States, Southeast and Southwest Areas Pension 
Plan (Central States) as mandated by its Teamsters contract. ARCB is the largest 
contributor to the plan and its contributions make up ~13% of Central States 
annual contributions. This plan is in a ‘critical and declining status’ and had a 
$25.7B deficit in January 2018, which would increase by about $2B per year if 
current trends continue. It is projected to run out of money in the 2024-2026 time 
frame. Under the terms of the new agreement with the Teamsters Union, ABF 
Freight’s contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the 
specified contributions when due until June 30, 2023, and the company is currently 
not recognizing any liability. However, if the Central states Pension Plan continues 
on this path, the liability could be about $40B when the money runs out. If
5 


legislative action is not undertaken to remedy the status of Central States, which 
will depend on politics, resolution of the insolvency at that time may include 
higher contributions by employers and retiree benefit cuts. ARCB’s liability could 
be 13% of $40B, or ~$5B, which is substantially larger then the company’s equity 
of $0.7B. Hence, shareholders could theoretically be wiped out.  


 
The “street” expects revenue increases in 2H 18 and in 2019, primarily from 


LTL price increases, and projects revenues of $1.583B and $3.24B, respectively. 
Some bulls think that revenue could reach $3.33B in 2019. Y/Y price increases in 
the ABF Freight segment are expected to be around 15% in 2H 18 and around 8% 
in 2019. We forecast 12% and 2% price increases in 2H 18 and 2019, respectively. 
Our 2019 assumption may be generous if the economy slows down. We also think 
that ARCB should continue to lose share, and forecast of $1.573B and $3.162B, 
respectively, in 2H 18 and 2019. Our EPS projections for 2H 18 and 2019 are 
$1.81 and $3.00, respectively, compared to consensus of $1.85 and $3.48. The 
differences between our estimates and consensus is due to the revenue differences 
mentioned earlier and our expectation of higher operating ratios in 2H 18 and 
2019, compared to “street” projections. We detail these in the valuation section. 


 
ARCB shares have traded at an average multiple of 13X two-year consensus 


forward earnings over the past three years. Over that time, the P/E ratio on two-
year forward consensus EPS has ranged from 7X to 22X, with an average of 13X. 
Since we expect earnings to decline Y/Y in 2019, we apply a multiple of 12X to 
our 2019 EPS estimate of $3.00 to obtain our initial price target of $36.

Background: 
 
 ArcBest (ARCB) originated in 1923 as a local freight hauler called OK 
Transfer in Fort Smith, Arkansas. In 1935, OK Transfer acquired Arkansas Motor 
Freight (AMF) and assumed its name. In 1956, AMF acquired Best Motor Freight 
and adopted the moniker Arkansas Best Freight System, or ABF Freight. 
Following a name change to Arkansas Best Corporation, the company became 
public in 1972. The company’s stock price fell by 75% in the 1987 stock market 
crash. In 1988, a 28-year old New Yorker named Emanuel Pearlman, who had 
been in the takeover business for 48 hours, attempted a hostile takeover of 
Arkansas Best. Arkansas Best found a white knight in a New York-based private
6 


equity firm named Kelso & Company, and became private. Four years later, in 
1992, Arkansas Best again became a listed company. 
 
 ARCB is organized into three segments: Asset-Based (ABF Freight), 
ArcBest (asset-light logistics), and FleetNet (commercial fleet maintenance and 
roadside assistance). Table 1 below shows the breakdown of revenues by segment. 
The company’s customer base is fragmented. In 2017, no customer accounted for 
more than 5% of revenues, and the ten largest customers generated 12% of total 
revenues.

 In Table 2, we show operating income by segment. ABF Freight generates 
the substantial majority of the company’s operating income. The profit margins of 
the asset-light businesses (ArcBest & FleetNet) are comparable to those of ABF 
Freight.

 ABF Freight operates in the LTL market. LTL refers to providers that 
generally transport shipments of less than 10,000 pounds, while TL (or Truckload) 
refers to providers generally transporting shipments greater than 10,000 pounds.  


The TL segment is the largest portion of the “for-hire” truck transportation 
market. Truckload carriers primarily transport large shipments from origin to 
destination with no intermediate handling. Although a full truckload can weigh 
over 40,000 pounds, it is common for truckload carriers to haul two or three 
shipments exceeding 10,000 pounds each at one time making multiple delivery 
stops. 


Because truckload carriers do not require an expansive network to provide 
point-to-point service, the overall cost structure of truckload carriers is typically 
lower and more variable relative to LTL carriers. However, the lack of a network 
subjects their drivers to extended periods away from home thus resulting in higher 
driver turnover and periodic driver shortages. The truckload segment is comprised 
of several major carriers and numerous small entrepreneurial players. At the most 
basic level, a truckload company can be started with capital for rolling stock (a 
tractor and a trailer), insurance, a driver and little else. As size becomes a factor, 
capital is needed for technology, infrastructure and some limited facilities. LTL 
carriers may sometimes participate in the truckload market as a means to fill empty 
miles in lanes that are not at capacity. 


Capital requirements are significantly higher in the traditional LTL segment 
versus the truckload segment. In the LTL sector, substantial amounts of capital are 
required for a network of service facilities, shipment handling equipment and 
revenue equipment (both for city pick-up, delivery and line haul). In addition, 
investment in technology has become increasingly important in the LTL segment 
largely due to the number of transactions and number of customers served on a 
daily basis. ABF Freight picks up approximately 20,000 shipments per day, each of 
which has a shipper and consignee, and sometimes a third party payor, all of whom 
need access to information in a timely manner. More importantly, technology plays 
a key role in improving customer service, operations efficiency and compliance, 
safety and yield management. As a result of the significant infrastructure required 
to operate an LTL carrier, the LTL segment is more concentrated than the 
truckload segment with the largest LTL players in the national and regional
8 


markets. Driver turnover in the LTL sector is low relative to the truckload sector, 
although LTL carriers can also face periodic driver shortages. 


 
LTL carriers typically pickup numerous shipments, generally ranging from 


100 to 10,000 pounds, and consolidate them at carrier-operated service facilities 
within a certain radius and then transport the shipments from the origin facility to 
the carrier-operated destination facility and then deliver the shipments to the 
ultimate destination. As a result, LTL carriers require expansive networks of 
pickup and delivery operations around local service facilities and shipments are 
moved between origin and destination often through an intermediate distribution or 
“break-bulk” facility.  
 


Depending on the distance shipped, the LTL segment historically was 
classified into three subgroups, Regional (average shipment distance is typically 
less than 1,200 miles, one or two days of travel), Interregional (average shipment 
distance is usually between 1,200 and 1,500 miles, 2 to 3 days), and National 
(average shipment distance is typically in excess of 1,500 miles, 3 to 5 days). Over 
time, there has been a blurring of the three subgroups as individual companies are 
increasingly serving multiple markets. Today, most LTL carriers, including ABF 
Freight, service all three subgroups. 
 


In 2017, annual LTL revenues were $40B. FedEx Freight was the largest 
LTL carrier with a share of about 16%, followed by XPO Freight (9%), Old 
Dominion (8%), YRC Freight (8%), UPS Freight (6%), Estes Express Line (6%), 
ABF Freight (5%), R+L Carriers (4%), SAIA (3%) and Holland (3%). 
  


ARCB has 13,000 employees, of whom 66% belong to the International 
Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) union. The union employees are primarily part of 
the ABF Freight segment. 82% of that segment’s employees are unionized. A new 
collective bargaining agreement, the ABF National Master Freight Agreement (the 
‘2018 ABF NMFA’) was implemented on July 29, 2018, effective retroactive to 
April 1, 2018, and will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. 
 


The major economic provisions of the 2018 ABF NMFA include restoration 
of one week of vacation which begins accruing on anniversary dates on or after 
April 1, 2018; wage rate increases in each year of the contract, beginning July 1, 
2018; ratification bonuses for qualifying employees; profit-sharing bonuses upon 
the Asset-Based segment’s achievement of certain annual operating ratios for any 
full calendar year under the contract; and changes to purchased transportation 
provisions with certain protections for road drivers as specified in the contract. The 
2018 ABF NMFA and the related supplemental agreements provide for 
contributions to multiemployer pension plans frozen at the current rates for each
9 


fund, continuation of existing health coverage, and annual contribution rate 
increases to multiemployer health and welfare plans maintained for the benefit of 
ABF's employees who are members of the IBT. Under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the 
contractual wage and benefits costs, including the ratification bonuses and vacation 
restoration, are estimated to increase approximately 2.0% on a compounded annual 
basis through the end of the agreement. 


 
As a condition of its union contracts, ARCB contributes to 25 multiemployer 


pension funds (MPPs). The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PGBC) defines 
an MPP, also sometime referred to as a Taft-Hartley plan, as “a collectively 
bargained plan maintained by more than one employer, usually within the same or 
related industries, and a labor union”. More details regarding MPPs are available at 
https://www.ifebp.org/news/featuredtopics/multiemployer/Pages/default.aspx. The 
key feature to remember about these plans is that the contributors to the plans are 
jointly and severally liable. If one of the contributors goes bankrupt, the other 
contributors are liable for the amounts that the bankrupt contributor is unable to 
pay.  This is known as the “last man standing” rule, as explained below.  


 
About 20% of these MPPs, primarily covering participants in the coal, 


trucking, manufacturing, service, retail and food industries, are currently so 
underfunded that they are considered to be in ‘critical’ or ‘critical and declining’ 
status. The funding ratio of these plans (market value of assets/liabilities) is just 
60%. Such plans are likely to become insolvent in the next 5-20 years, and are 
likely to cut retiree benefits. Two plans, Central States and United Mine Workers 
of America 1974 Pension Plan (UMWA Plan) are considered to be in an even 
worse ‘death spiral’ condition. These plans are so cash flow negative that they are 
shifting assets from long-term growth investments to cash to pay benefits. 


 
The MPPs are supposed to be backstopped by the PGBC multiemployer 


program, which is funded from premiums paid by participating MPP employers 
and interest income from US Treasury debt. There is no taxpayer funding. As of 
2017, the PGBC multiemployer program had a $65B deficit. Employer premiums 
have more than tripled in the last ten years to $28 per participant for 2018, but the 
maximum PGBC payout has stayed relatively low and is currently $1,251 per year. 


 
A report issued by the US Chamber of Commerce in December 2017 stated: 
 
“As contributing employers to these plans failed, funding levels plummeted. Remaining 


employers see their long-term viability threatened by ever increasing pension liability brought on 
by employers that went bankrupt, liquidated, or otherwise went out of business. When employers 
stop contributing to a pension fund, all remaining employers are required to pick up the slack and 
assume proportionate liability for the payments owed to the exited employer’s ‘orphan’ 
employees. As employers leave the pool of contributors, each remaining employer’s percentage 
of the growing funding deficit gets larger. This is known as the ‘last man standing’ rule
10 


(emphasis ours) and was established to protect plan participants from the consequences of 
employer withdrawals. The ‘last man standing’ rule has rendered multiemployer plans unstable 
as nobody wants to be the last man standing. This provides incentive for even healthy employers 
to leave, and puts the PBGC in the role of the ultimate ‘last man.’” 
 


In June 2018, in another report highlighting the crisis, the US Chamber of 
Commerce noted: 


 
“Plan insolvency will obviously exacerbate the problems faced by contributing employers. If 


a plan goes insolvent but does not terminate, businesses could be required to pay contributions in 
perpetuity—meaning a permanent strain on their finances. However, if an insolvent plan does 
terminate, the financial situation for employers becomes even more drastic. Contributing employers 
could be assessed with immediate withdrawal liability; could be part of a mass termination; and/or 
could be subjected to minimum funding rules, which would require even higher contributions and 
possible excise taxes. Any one of these scenarios could drive an employer into bankruptcy. 
 


In addition to the threat of an individual plan becoming insolvent, there is a significant 
concern that such an outcome will cause other plans to fail—what is known as the ‘Contagion 
Effect.’ The financial solvency of a number of multiemployer plans is dependent upon only one or 
two contributing employers, and these businesses also contribute to several other plans. If one plan 
failure causes a major contributing employer to be unable to make continued contributions to other 
plans, those plans could fail as well. Again, this is uncharted territory; however, it is reasonable to 
foresee that if a contributing employer becomes financially distressed by one plan failure, it would 
have a detrimental effect on the other plans to which that employer contributes.” 


 
About 60% of the ARCB’s contributions, which totaled $158M in 2017, 


were made to plans in ‘critical and declining’ status, 1% were made to plans in 
‘critical’ but not ‘critical and declining’ status and 6% were made to plans in 
‘endangered’ status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. About half 
of the company’s annual contribution goes to the Central States Plan, which is 
projected to become insolvent by 2025. We discuss this plan in further detail later. 
 


On July 9, 2018, in accordance with the agreement reached between ABF 
Freight and New England Teamsters, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension plan 
obligation with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund 
(the ‘New England Pension Fund’) was restructured under a transition agreement 
effective on August 1, 2018. The New England Pension Fund is a multiemployer 
pension plan in ‘critical and declining’ status to which ABF Freight made 
approximately 3% of its total multiemployer pension contributions (or about $5M) 
in 2017. The New England Pension Fund was previously restructured to utilize a 
‘two pool approach’, which effectively subdivides the plan assets and liabilities 
between two groups of beneficiaries. In accordance with ABF Freight’s transition 
agreement with the New England Pension Fund, ABF Freight agreed to withdraw 
from the original pool to which it has historically been a participant (‘Existing 
Employer Pool’) and transition to the direct attribution liability pool (‘New 
Employer Pool’), which does not have an associated unfunded liability.
11 


  
ABF Freight’s transition agreement with the New England Pension Fund 


triggered a withdrawal liability settlement that satisfies ABF Freight’s existing 
potential withdrawal liability obligations to the Existing Employer Pool and 
minimizes the potential for future increases in withdrawal liability under the New 
Employer Pool. ABF Freight will transition to the New Employer Pool at a lower 
pension contribution rate than its current contribution rate under the Existing 
Employer Pool, and the new contribution rate will be frozen for a period of 10 
years. 
  


ABF Freight recognized a one-time pretax charge of $37.9M to record the 
withdrawal liability in June 2018, which equals the present value of the future 
withdrawal liability payments, discounted at a 4.5% interest rate. The discount rate 
was determined using the 20-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread, which is the 
rate that would be available to ABF Freight for long-term financing of a similar 
maturity. The withdrawal liability will be settled through the initial lump sum cash 
payment of $15.1M, which was paid on August 31, 2018, plus monthly tax-
deductible payments to the New England Pension Fund over a period of 23 years 
with an aggregate present value of $22.8M, which was recorded in other long-term 
liabilities as of June 30, 2018. 
 
 ABF Freight has 4,100 trucks and 20,000 trailers. The company has 245 
service centers in North America. ABF Freight’s service centers are located 
primarily in the eastern half of the US, and in Texas and California.  
 
Discussion: 
 
1. ARCB have risen 38% YTD and 76% Y/Y, far outperforming peers and the 
general market. Earnings have increased in the past few quarters, driven by 
revenue per shipment, and investors appear to be optimistic about future pricing 
growth.  
 


Price increases over the last year have been generated primarily by 
implementation of volume based pricing in August 2017, as well as from strength 
in spot pricing. The benefit from the former has anniversaried, and recent spot 
pricing data suggest that Y/Y spot price increases are losing steam. 
 
 Effective August 1, 2017, to better reflect the increasing proportion of e-
commerce driven larger and bulkier but lighter shipments in its shipment mix, 
ARCB implemented space-based pricing, which uses freight dimensions (length, 
width, height) to determine the applicable cubic minimum charges (CMC), that 
supplement weight-based metrics, where appropriate. This boosted revenue per
12 


shipment (Table 3). The benefits from this change should anniversary in Q3 18, 
and are likely to be minimal in future quarters.

Moreover, because of hurricane-related demand last fall and demand 
generated by higher economic activity from corporate tax cuts which took effect 
earlier in 2018, a higher proportion of business appears to have moved to spot 
pricing, which also increased revenue per shipment in the last three quarters. 
Shippers are taking action to reduce costs, as we describe later, and appear to be 
unwilling to sign contracts at current prices. Y/Y changes in spot pricing appear to 
be coming down sharply, as Figure 1 below indicates. While the spot prices below 
are truckload (TL), industry participants told us that the trend for LTL rates is 
similar. Note that spot prices were up 25%-35% Y/Y in 1H 18, but have started to 
decline since. Y/Y dry van spot prices are down 2% Y/Y so far in September.
13

A shortage of truck drivers has also contributed to pricing strength. 


However, the industry is taking several steps to alleviate this shortage. One is the 
increasing use of automatic transmission vehicles, which are not only more fuel-
efficient but also easier for drivers to learn than manual transmission trucks. An 
executive at a training school told us that the vast majority of trucks rolling off 
assembly lines today outfitted with automatic transmissions, and that he foresees 
pretty much all new trucks being automatic over the next 3-5 years. The industry is 
also lobbying for 18-20 year-old Commercial Driver License (CDL) holders to be 
permitted to make interstate deliveries. Such drivers can only make intrastate 
deliveries today. 


 
If truckers were expecting spot price increases to accelerate, very high 


demand for used trucks would likely ensue given that new trucks have a 10-month 
backlog due to shortages of truck parts and components. We would expect used 
truck prices would soar. However, as Figure 2 below shows, this does not appear to 
be the case. While used truck prices were ~5% higher Y/Y in May 2018, the 
pricing trend appears to be stable, and prices are actually 15% below 2014 levels, 
when truck orders previously peaked.

2. Customers are taking steps to alleviate their freight costs. These steps should 
also pressure spot prices. 
 
 On its FQ3 18 earnings call on August 23, Hormel Foods noted that it was 
maximizing weight per truck, and minimizing miles and frequency of deliveries to 
save on freight costs. Dollar General (DG) has been expanding its private fleet of 
trucks, and is diversifying its carrier base to obtain more competitive prices. To 
stem the number of truck miles to its stores, DG recently opened new distribution 
centers in Alachua, Florida, and Janesville, Wisconsin, and is constructing new 
distribution centers in New Amsterdam, NY and Longview, TX. Food distributor 
US Foods is maximizing the use of its own trucks to make pickups, and is avoiding 
using costly third party delivery. 
 
 These efforts appearing to be bearing fruit already in some instances. For 
example, J&J Snack Foods reported on July 31 that freight cost increases had 
started to slow relative to a year ago, in part because of the company’s efforts to 
optimize its manufacturing to reduce transportation costs.  
 
3. ARCB appears to be losing share, and seems reluctant to reinvest in its business. 
Competitors are spending far more on capex and service terminals. ARCB should 
continue to lose share, and when price increases slow or reverse, profitability could 
plummet. 
 
 In Table 1, we show Y/Y LTL shipment data for ARCB and its competitors, 
SAIA and ODFL. Note that ARCB’s shipment volumes have declined Y/Y in 
recent periods, in contrast to strong growth at its peers.
15 


Table 4: Y/Y changes in shipments for ARCB, SAIA and ODFL 


 
2015 2016 2017 1H 2018 


ARCB 2.4% 2.7% -0.4% -7.7% 
SAIA -4.0% -0.7% 5.2% 6.3% 
ODFL 11.6% 0.2% 5.8% 10.9% 
Source: Company reports 
 
 We think one reason for this loss of share is because ARCB has invested far 
less in its business than peers. For instance, over the past ten years, the number of 
service centers for ARCB is down 12%, while SAIA and ODFL have grown their 
service centers in the same timeframe by 5% and 19%, respectively. ARCB’s 
service centers also appear to be relatively unproductive. LTL revenue per service 
center for ABF Freight was $8.1M in 2017, versus $8.7M for SAIA and $14.7M 
for ODFL. Ten years ago, in 2007, the figures were much closer: $6.3M for ABF 
Freight, $6.5M for SAIA, and $7.3M for ODFL. 
 


Below, in Table 5, we show capex as a percentage of revenues for ARCB, 
SAIA and ODFL. Note that, in the past three years, ARCB has invested just 5.6% 
of its revenues in capital expenditures, versus 12.5% and 13.6%, respectively, for 
SAIA and ODFL.  
 
Table 5: Comparison of capex for ARCB, SAIA and ODFL 
(Amounts in $000) 2015 2016 2017 
ARCB sales  2,666,905   2,700,219   2,826,457  
ARCB capex  159,017   151,637   149,951  
ARCB capex % of sales 6.0% 5.6% 5.3% 
SAIA sales 1,221,331 1,218,481 1,378,510 
SAIA capex 112,700 152,400 217,000 
SAIA capex % of sales 9.2% 12.5% 15.7% 
ODFL sales 2,972,442 2,991,517 3,358,112 
ODFL capex 462,059 417,941 382,125 
ODFL capex % of sales 15.5% 14.0% 11.4% 
Source: Company reports 
 
 This relative underinvestment is expected to continue. In 2018, ARCB plans 
to spend $160M, up 7% Y/Y on capex. SAIA plans to spend $265M, up 22% Y/Y, 
and ODFL plans to spend $555M, up 45% Y/Y. Therefore, we think ARCB could 
continue to lose share. 
 
 Perhaps because its workforce is unionized, ABF Freight appears to be 
relying on higher cost third parties (purchased transportation) to handle 
incremental demand to a larger extent than peers, as shown in Table 6. This may be 
an indication of a lack of confidence in its long-term prospects.

4. In the fall of 2017, Amazon Logistics (AMZL) embarked on a program called 
Amazon Relay, which uses independent contractors for runs up to 500 miles (one 
way). ABF Freight’s regional business accounted 60% of its tonnage in 2017. 
Thus, Amazon Relay, if successful, could displace a meaningful portion of ABF 
Freight’s business. 
 
 According to industry participants, AMZL has ordered 55k trailers, and has 
taken delivery of 10,000 already. It anticipates that in three years, after it has taken 
delivery of all the 55k trailers, the Relay program would ship 65% of AMZL’s 
business, up from 21% today. This includes shipments of AMZN products and 
third party products sold on AMZN’s web site. It is offering independent truckers 
with fleets of 10-40 trucks $1,800 for a round trip of up to 1,000 miles, plus fuel 
costs, which are paid via AMZN cards. Participants in the Relay program need to 
maintain high (at least 80%, but preferably 90%+) on-time/load-acceptance ratings 
to remain in the program. 
 
 The economics of Amazon Relay seem favorable for independent truckers. 
They get $1.80 per mile plus fuel, which is at the high end of the $1.30-$1.80 per 
mile (including fuel costs of about 30 cents per mile) that some brokers pay. 
Moreover, because of the higher rates they get, Amazon Relay truckers can pay 
drivers better wages than the 40-42 cents per mile that the national and regional 
operators pay. 
 
 Industry participants think AMZN will be successful in attracting truckers 
for other reasons as well. They note that Amazon Relay truckers would get to 
spend more time at home than other over-the-road truckers. They don’t have to 
buy, lease or maintain trailers. Finally, the shipments are drop and hook, which 
means that the driver does not have to touch the trailer, just hook and unhook it.
17 


 In its 2017 10-K, ARCB noted that regional LTL, which it defined as 
tonnage moving 1,000 miles or less, constituted approximately 60% of tonnage in 
2017. Given AMZL’s ambitions with respect to growing Amazon Relay, LTL 
regional carriers such as ABF Freight and freight brokers are likely to lose share.  
 
5. ARCB’s Central States pension problem is little understood and worse than 
thought. 
 


We noted earlier that the Central States pension plan is likely to be insolvent 
in 7 years. ARCB is the largest contributor to the plan, and its payments constitute 
13% of total employer contributions to that plan (Table 7).  


 
Table 7: Contributions to Central States pension plan 
(Amounts in $M) 2015 2016 2017 
Total employer contributions to Central States  582.3   586.7   612.4  
ARCB contributions  77.5   77.9   78.2  
ARCB contributions % of total employer contributions 13.3% 13.3% 12.8% 
Source: Company reports, US Department of Labor filings 


 
The Central States pension plan is deteriorating rapidly, as Table 8 shows. 


The funded percentage (the ratio of assets to liabilities) has been declining rapidly 
both on actuarial and market value bases. The plan deficit has soared and totaled 
$25.6B at the end of 2017. The plan paid out $2.8B in benefits and received 
employer contributions and withdrawal liabilities of $0.8B in 2017. Thus, the 
deficit would increase by $2B annually on the current course, and the deficit at the 
time of insolvency would approach $40B, theoretically putting ARCB’s potential 
liability to over $4B. ARCB’s equity is only 0.7B.

Earlier, we noted that the ‘last man standing’ rule implies that the 
contribution of each remaining employer gets larger in proportion to its 
contribution, as failing employers exit. The next two largest contributors to the 
Central States pension plan are YRC Inc. and Jack Cooper Transport Company, 
each of which contributes 5% of total employer contributions. These two
18 


companies are substantially more levered than ARCB, and their ability to keep 
contributing could be significantly affected if trucking industry conditions 
deteriorate. If this were to occur, ARCB could see a sizable liability increase and it 
may be forced to issue equity to its retirees, which could result in significant 
dilution of existing shareholders.  


 
We note that in July 2011, YRC Worldwide, another unionized LTL carrier, 


was forced to recapitalize by issuing shares to the Teamsters Union, in part 
because it was unable to contribute to Teamster pension plans, including Central 
States, from Q3 2009 to May 2011 as a result of significant deterioration of its 
financial condition.  
 


Some MPP employers are holding out hope for action from Congress. A 
Joint Select Committee on Solvency of Multiemployer Pension Plans has been 
established, composed of equal numbers of House and Senate members from each 
party, tasked with recommending legislation by November 30, 2018, designed to 
improve the solvency of multiemployer pension plans and the Pension Benefit 
Guaranty Corporation (PBGC). Given the polarized political climate, and budget 
constraints, expecting decisive action that might offer substantial help from 
Congress and taxpayers is probably unrealistic. 
 
6. Manufacturers are building inventory in response to vendor lead times, 
transportation bottlenecks and higher input costs, or inflation. Because at least 
some of the inventory building appears to be driven by fear, any realization that 
end markets have slowed and that there is too much inventory in the channel would 
adversely impact demand for ARCB.  
 
 Figure 3 below shows manufacturing vendor lead-time index as tracked by 
the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond. Note that lead times have soared recently, 
exacerbated by shortages of skilled workers. These have led to component 
shortages that have been noted by manufacturers as diverse as Caterpillar (heavy 
machinery), Boeing (aerospace), Flex (contract electronic manufacturing) and 
Lennox (HVAC equipment). In response, many companies such as Idex, a 
manufacturer of fluid and metering technologies such as pumps, valves and meters, 
are building inventory of key components, just in case future shortages occur.
19

 The downside of such inventory building is that it may not be completely 
demand driven. If demand should ease, companies could find themselves stuck 
with too much inventory, resulting in a manufacturing slowdown. This would 
pressure demand for trucking services, and thus trucking rates.  
 
7. The current agreement with the Teamsters runs out in 2023, and the Central 
States Pension Plan is expected to become insolvent in 2015. Since ARCB’s long 
term situation vis a vis its pension obligations depends a great deal on what 
happens to the trucking industry longer term, we thought it would interesting to 
appropriate to understand how industry observers foresee the trucking industry 
evolving over the next ten years.

 On the other hand, a more pessimistic view is taken in this article:

bd97fcf3f9e25e1ce5d9&utm_term=newsletter-2-daily-position-3. The author 
makes the case that growth of automation and more efficient supply chains should 
challenge the trucking sector.  
 
 As it is a cyclical business, trucking has historically invited skepticism from 
investors. Recent strength in transportation may have had a lulling effect on this 
investor skepticism. However, if pricing strength can’t go on forever, while we 
can’t predict the exact moment, there is likely more downside than upside in 
trucking in coming years. 
 
8. Recent results. 
 


ARCB reported Q2 18 results on July 31. Revenues of $793M exceeded 
consensus of $788M, and adjusted EPS of $1.12 (excluding the $38M charge for 
the New England Pension Fund withdrawal) beat “street” estimates by 11 cents.  


 
ABF Freight revenue of $559M was $11M above “street” estimates. 


Adjusted operating income of $41M was $7M above expectations. ABF Freight’s 
operating ratio (operating expenses/revenues) in Q2 18, excluding the charge 
related to the New England Pension Fund), was 92.6%, which was down 300 basis 
points Y/Y and the lowest operating ratio in over a decade. ABF Freight’s Q2 18 
operating ratio appears to have benefited from price increases from the space-based 
initiatives as well as some one-time items such as price savings from a new health 
care agreement negotiated in August 2017. 


 
ArcBest, the logistics arm, posted Q2 18 revenue of $200M, above “street” 


estimates of $196M. However, operating income of $3.7M was lower than bullish 
expectations of as much as $7M. The company blamed lower Y/Y shipments and 
higher purchased transportation costs resulting from tight truck capacity for the 
shortfall. 
 
 FleetNet’s revenue of $47M was higher than consensus of $40M. Operating 
income of $1M was also higher than consensus of $0.8M. 
 
 DSO at the end of Q2 18 was 35 days, flat Y/Y. The company had net debt 
of $22.3M at Q2 18 end. Book value was $25.04 and tangible book was $18.31.
21 


 We show ARCB’s free cash flow (FCF) generation in Table 9. Note that the 
company finances a portion of revenue equipment (tractors and trailers) purchases 
through notes payable and capital leases. More than half of its capex is financed 
this way. In Table 9, we show both FCF and SCF (which removes the impact of 
working capital) on an adjusted basis (i.e., including capex that is financed).

 Note that FCF and SCF have been weak over the last three years. While FCF 
and SCF appear to have improved in 1H 18, that is because the majority of 
spending related to new tractors is expected to occur in Q3 18. ARCB expects 
capex to total $160M in 2018. 
 
9. Financial Assumptions. 
 
a. ABF Freight. 
 
 Table 10 shows Y/Y changes in shipments per day and revenue per shipment 
in recent quarters. In its August update, ARCB reported that daily shipments were 
down 2% Y/Y in July 2018 and August 2018. While we expect that ABF Freight 
would continue to lose share because of reasons cited earlier, it benefits from easy 
comps starting in Q3 17. We forecast flat daily shipments Y/Y in 2H 18 and 1% 
Y/Y growth in 2019. The “street” assumptions in Y/Y daily shipment growth for 
2H 18 and 2019 appear to be similar to ours.
22

Workdays 64.0 63.5 62.5 61.5 63.5 64.0 
Y/Y Asset-Based shipments per day 6% 4% -1% -8% -9% -6% 
Y/Y revenues per shipment 0% 2% 5% 12% 16% 15% 


Source: Company reports 
  
 As noted previously, revenue per shipment has increased at double-digit 
rates since the implementation of space-based pricing in August 2017 and higher 
spot rates resulting from higher economic activity resulting from the corporate tax 
cut in 1H 2018. The space-based pricing benefit anniversaried in August 2018 and 
we think the tax cut benefit will anniversary in Q1 19. Spot rates already appear to 
be weakening (Figure 1). Accordingly, we forecast 12% growth in Y/Y revenue 
per shipment in 2H 18 and 2% growth in 2019. The “street” appears to assume 
15% Y/Y revenue per shipment increases in 2H 18 and 8% growth in 2019.  
 


We assume operating ratio of 94% in 2H 18 and 95% in 2019. The “street” 
is in line with OWS for 2H 18, but is 70-90 basis points below OWS in 2019. The 
difference is because the “street’s” assumptions of revenue per shipment in 2019 
are higher than OWS. 


 
b. ArcBest (asset-light logistics).

Workdays 63.5 64.0 
Y/Y Revenue per shipment 23.8% 16.2% 
Y/Y Shipments per day -5.9% -6.0%

 In its August update, ARCB noted that overall revenue (i.e., Revenue per 
shipment times number of shipments) was up just 2% Y/Y in July 2018 and 
August 2018, and noted that higher revenue per shipment Y/Y was offset by lower 
daily shipments. This appears to be a significant slowdown from 1H 18. We 
forecast 8% Y/Y increase in revenue per shipment in 2H 18 and 5% in 2019. We 
forecast 5% and 2% Y/Y declines, respectively, in daily shipments in 2H 18 and in 
2019. The “street’s” forecasts for ArcBest appear to be similar to ours in 2H 18, 
but a bit higher in 2019.

 We assume operating ratios of 98% in 2H 18 and in 2019, in line with recent 
performance. The “street” appears to be 80 basis points below us both in 2H 18 
and in 2019. 
 
c. FleetNet. 
 
 We assume Y/Y revenue growth of 8% in 2H 18 and −3% in 2019 because 
of difficult comparisons in 1H 19. The “street” is in line with us in 2H 18, but 
assumes 3% growth in 2019. 
 
 We assume operating ratios of 97.5% in 2H 18 and in 2019, in line with 
recent trends. The “street” estimates are similar to ours. 
 
d. Other items. 
 
 Our net interest expense assumption is $3M for 2H 18 and $6M for 2019, in 
line with “street” expectations. Our assumed tax rate is 22.5% for 2H 18 and 23% 
for 2019. The “street” is in line with us for 2H 18 but assumes 25%-26% for 2019. 
Our assumed diluted share count of 26.8M for 2H 18 and 26.9M for 2019 is in line 
with recent trends and is similar to consensus. 
 
10. Valuation & risks. 
 
 Table 12 shows our revenue and EPS estimates, based on the foregoing 
assumptions, along with those of the “street”. The primary reasons for our 
estimates being lower are our lower revenue per shipment estimates and our 
operating ratio assumptions for ABF Freight. 
 
Table 12: Comparison of OWS and “street” estimates for ARCB 
(Amounts in $M) OWS estimates "Street" estimates 
2H 18 net sales ($M)  1,573   1,583  
2H EPS ($)  1.81   1.85  
2019 net sales ($M)  3,162   3,240  
2019 EPS ($)  3.00   3.48

ARCB shares trade at about 14X 2019 consensus today. Over the past three 
years, the P/E ratio on two-year forward consensus EPS has ranged from 7X to 
22X with an average of 13X. As we expect annual earnings to decline after 2018, 
we apply a 12X multiple to our 2019 EPS estimate of $3.00 to obtain a target price 
of $36.
24 


YRCW, which, like ARCB, has Teamster workers and significant pension 
liabilities, trades at 7X 2019 consensus EPS. YRCB has higher leverage and a 
more checkered past. Competitors SAIA and ODFL, which are union-free and 
have no pension liabilities, trade at 20X and 23X 2019 consensus EPS. 
 
 Because of its pension liabilities and union workforce, ARCB is unlikely to 
be an acquisition target. The chief risk to our recommendation is that prices 
accelerate. The recent spot rate action suggests that this is unlikely.
