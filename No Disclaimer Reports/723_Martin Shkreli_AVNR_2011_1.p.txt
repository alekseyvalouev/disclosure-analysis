Avanir Pharmaceuticals: Compelling Short Sale Opportunity

Shares of Avanir Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AVNR) represent a compelling short sale
opportunity. I calculate fair value of AVNR at just $1 per share, versus the current market
price of $4.62. Importantly, I think the price will approach this value rapidly given weak
Nuedexta sales and short intellectual property life.


Nuedexta is the combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine for the treatment of a
neurological condition called ‘pseudobulbar affect’. This is a rare condition which results in
uncontrolled laughing or crying in patients with neurological damage (multiple sclerosis,
ALS, stroke, etc.). Nuedexta is Avanir’s only drug, either approved or in development. In
clinical study, the efficacy of Nuedexta was modest. For example, after 12 weeks of
treatment, the average number of laughing/crying incidences for placebo patients
decreased by 3, while the average number for patients on Nuedexta decreased by 4.


Put another way (as described in an AVNR press release in October 2009), after 12
weeks of clinical study, 61% of patients on placebo had had no PBA episode in the prior 2
weeks, compared to 80% on Nuedexta. That is, Nuedexta provided 19% fewer emotional
outbursts than did a sugar pill. Nuedexta also provided an advantage in another measure,
the least squares CNS-L score (Center for Neurologic Studies Liability Scale, a seven-
item self-report questionnaire with 3 items assessing crying and 4 assessing laughter). At
week 12, CNS-L improved in placebo patients by 6 points, compared to 8 points in
Nuedexta patients.


Having only one approved drug, with nothing else in its pipeline, makes calculating the
value of Avanir relatively easy.

Avanir’s second quarter launch isn’t going much better than the first. “Better” is all relative
of course as you’ll see in the valuation section. The discontinuation rate of Nuedexta is
quite high – NRx (new prescriptions) are not translating into TRX (total prescriptions),
which, as one analyst put it, describes the “episodic” nature of how these patients take this
drug. It appears many patients feel Nuedexta is worse than their PBA symptoms. Because
there has never been a drug for PBA, there should have been a bolus in patients at the
launch who quickly came on to Nuedexta. With only 300-400 TRx weekly (at $490 a Rx
that is a paltry $10 million/year sales run-rate), we are left to ask, “that’s it? Those are all
the patients who have been waiting and clamoring for a PBA drug? Definitely a head-
scratcher.


The notion that Avanir has to educate physicians to bring the PBA out of their patients in
testimonials is a tough sell. MS and ALS patients see their physicians often. The
discontinuation rate, coupled with the idea that PBA is simply not a common condition –
neurological issues are rare to begin with, and PBA so severe it merits special
pharmacokinetic intervention with a relatively cheap drug ($5,000 annual cost) spells a
product that can’t support its associated sales force cost. Finally, I wouldn’t underestimate
that sales reps are “journeymen”. Once they realize their drug isn’t hitting targets, they
leave for the next gig.


Valuation – IP

Let’s remember the enterprise value (market cap minus cash plus debt) of Avanir is $450
million. My favorite part of the drug business is the relative ease with which one can value
approved drug assets. Drugs have finite lives which are easily determined, and sales
trajectories which are predictable and can be estimated both conservatively and
aggressively.


The poor launch of Avanir is just half of the short thesis. The other half, which seems less
appreciated, is intellectual property. A key determining factor of the value of any
pharmaceutical asset is the life of the asset. Recall the Buffett moat. There is no moat in
the drug business. Your product disappears and you know when it disappears. Sometimes
it’s not so clear, as in this case. However, a good rule of thumb is that if there is no new
chemical entity present in a drug, and it’s a small molecule (in this case, two), the life of
the drug is going to be pretty short.


The statutory exclusivity for a new combination is three years—so that’s the shortest
amount of time Nuedexta can be on the market without generics. An “ANDA” paragraph IV
filing can be filed quickly after approval. For instance, Somaxon (NASDAQ:SOMX)
received a paragraph IV filing for Silenor just weeks after FDA approval. I expect a
Paragraph IV ANDA filer to appear for Nuedexta soon. This begins a 30-month-stay clock
during which the ANDA filer and the innovator litigate over IP.


The IP for Nuedexta is extremely weak. Avanir invented nothing in combining
dextromethorphan and quinidine. Their four patents, 7,659,282, RE38,115, 5,166,207, and
5,206,248 all are preceded by prior art easily found here. The concept of metabolic
enablers and the use of dextromethorphan in pseudobulbar affect was well known before
these patents were filed. There are a number of papers that are easy examples of prior art
showing CYP450 bioconversion of dextromethorphan. Avanir has been working on this
drug for quite some time. Remember that for a patent filing to be valid, there cannot be
public "prior art" which would invalidate that patent.


The '282 patent, which was filed in 2005, has claims which are questionable given the
prior art revealed in the work Avanir published in 2004. Read these claims from RE38,115:

We claim:


1. A method of increasing the effectiveness of dextromethorphan in treating chronic
or intractable pain, comprising administering to a patient suffering from chronic or
intractable pain a therapeutically effective dosage of dextromethorphan or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, in combination with a therapeutically
effective dosage of a debrisoquin hydroxylase inhibitor.


2. The method of claim 1 wherein the debrisoquin hydroxylase inhibitor is selected
from the group consisting of quinidine, quinine, and pharmaceutically acceptable
salts thereof.


And contrast with the claims in 5,166,207 (expired in 2009 or 2014 with full Hatch-
Waxman restoration, too soon to stop a generic):


What is claimed is:


1. A method for enhancing the systemic delivery of dextromethorphan for the
treatment of a neurological disorder resulting in injury to nervous tissue, which
comprises:


administering to a patient suffering from said neurological disorder an amount of a
cytochrome P450IID6 enzyme inhibitor, sufficient to block dextromethorphan
metabolism, and an amount of dextromethorphan, sufficient to treat said
neurological disorder.


2. The method of claim 1, wherein said inhibitor is quinidine.


This is an obvious genus/species patent mistake that likely should have never been
issued. RE38,115 is "anticipated" in patent speak, by '207. One can't claim "enhancing the
systemic delivery of dextro with quinidine for neurological conditions" in one patent
granted in 1992 and then try again to claim "increasing the effectiveness of dextro with
quinidine in pain" in a new patent in 2003. Sadly, this innovation is indeed 19+ years old. A
few years too old for Avanir to fight off generics in just a few years.


Valuation – Based on sales, earnings, cash flow, fair value with asset life determined at
roughly 3 to 5 years, we can easily determine the fair value of the stream of cash flows
that encompass Avanir. While I contest Avanir will never be profitable, and ride off into the
sunset like Nitromed (NTMD) and other woe-be-gone companies, let’s assume Avanir is
purchased by a company who would almost eliminate all of their costs. This might be a

more fair way to value Avanir since a buyer could afford to pay an enhanced price using
this methodology. Top funds employ frameworks like this to allow them to figure out fair
value when it is obscured by investment. Let’s be very kind to Avanir and see what
happens.


Sales Gross Profit SG&A Operating Income Net Income


2012 34 31 10 21 21


2013 70 63 10 53 53


2014 104 94 10 84 67


2015 136 122 10 112 90


2016 176 159 10 149 119


I’m being very generous to Avanir to illustrate a point. I don’t think Avanir will achieve
these sales estimates – the current sales trend suggests they’d be very lucky to achieve
half or a quarter of these estimates. Valuing Avanir assuming a takeout and almost zero
costs (SG&A is actually 5x what I am estimating) is also aggressive. The NPV of these 5
years of cash flows plus the current cash is just $321 million or $2.64 per share (10%
discount rate). If you don't know how to calculate NPVs, please learn as it is 1) easy and
2) the cornerstone of finance. In Microsoft Excel, type =NPV(discount rate, stream of cash
flows).


For example, in the above cash flow table, try =NPV(10%,21,53,67,90,119). You can use
your own estimates, of course, and toy with the discount rate. Keep in mind AVNR is
losing lots of money at the moment, so any forecast of cash flow is aggressive, and in my
mind, unlikely.


Part of my goal writing here is not only to "show my work", but also to teach how a fund
like mine values a firm like Avanir. This is my 12th year in the hedge fund business and I
am happy to share what I've learned and my experiences (good and bad!) with you all.


Avanir is likely the next Somaxon
