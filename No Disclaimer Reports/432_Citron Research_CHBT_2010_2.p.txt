CHINA BIOTICS (CHBT) IS A
FRAUD – NOW SUE
CITRON- WE DARE YOU.


Yesterday, DYP and DGW were the number 1 and 2
losers in the market declining 54% and 41%
respectively.  This only shows the fragility and lack
of transparency that exists with small cap Chinese
companies.  Citron will prove that China Biotics
does not just lack transparency, but rather it is an
outright fraud


Citron Research has been writing about stock fraud
for over 9 years.  In that time, we uncovered
numerous frauds that have subsequently been
delisted and management charged by the SEC.  Yes,
we have made mistakes in the past, as have even
the best researchers, but we have NEVER been
wrong about a fraud. 


With that, Citron is con�dent to state “China
Biotics is a fraud” If we are lying, then please sue
us and we will prove it in court.  Or, put out a
press release defending yourself and explicitly
blame Citron Research, and we will sue you
proactively to prove that you are committing
securities fraud on the investing public.


We do not use the fraud word lightly, but frauds
have a certain way of playing out, and sure enough
CHBT management is following along right with the

script.  You don’t have to be Sherlock Holmes or
even Encyclopedia Brown to �gure this one out.


The curious case of the missing stores and the ol’
switcheroo trick. 
Two weeks ago in our �rst article, Citron questioned
the “network of stores” that are claimed by CHBT
—  the same stores referenced in years’ worth of
SEC �lings, but are also discussed in every analyst
report.  More importantly, the stores that investors
relied upon when they forked over $75 million for
shares .  Citron does not believe that Roth Capital
intentionally tried to defraud the public, rather
they became collateral damage.    In the second line
under use of proceeds, the registration statement
states “to expand our retail operations”.


Once we questioned the stores existence, CHBT
immediately put on their website a list of the
“branded stores” as they state in their SEC �lings.


Within hours Citron was able to determine that
these were not their stores, 95% of them were just
supermarkets and retail outlets.  We took it a step
further and hired two private investigators to take
pictures and prove what we knew.  Once we
brought that to the attention of the investing public,
the company changed their website again to
eliminate the word “stores”…a play right out of the
scamsters’ handbook.  They also eliminated the
line  “The Company’s most recognizable customers
include Bright Dairy, and Relax Xinqiao.” Why?  Now
it just says “the following is a list of sample locations
where you can �nd our product.“

Page 4, bottom:  China-biotics operated 111
retail outlets as of March 31, 2010, each
outlet has an average payback of less than
one year.”


Where are the stores?  Where is the money that
goes to salaries and leases for these stores?  Whose
pockets is it in???   Did we mention this is a fraud??


The curious case of the missing money… check this out.
When you put money in the bank you get
interest… DUH.


China Biotics claims its cash in the bank is $159.7
million in the bank, according to its June 30 SEC
�ling – every dollar of which is supposedly available
for corporate purposes.  Yet it reports interest of
just $87,876. So where is the interest? . How can
the company be earning interest of less than 1/10th
of comparable companies?   Companies with large
cash balances earn interest.  Interest rates on free
cash balances in China earn 1% for 3 month to 1
year term deposits, and 2% for 1 to 2 year term
deposits.


Simple math tells us that at 1% interest the cash
should generate $400,000 per quarter in interest
income.  At 2% this same cash balance should
generate $800,000 per quarter.


So either the company is only getting 1/10th the
interest rate that it should be getting in china, or
90% of the money is not IN THE BANK.  One would
assume that the company is using some of the
funds for working capital and to build out its new
operations. However the SEC �ling states that it is
all in the bank!


CHOP earned $278,000 (1.44%) interest on $77.3
million in the last quarter.


XIN earned $554,000 (1.33%) interest on $166
million in the last quarter

CAGC earned $171,000 (1.32%) interest on $51.7
million in the last quarter.


Even Orient Paper earned $108K (1.55%) interest
on its $7 Million cash in 2009…


The curious case of the conflicting financials


A great debate is now ongoing about disclosure
documents �led in China and those �led in the US. 
Citron has read the “plausible deniability”
explanations from Roth and others about how
variations in rollups and tax treatment might make
for a partial misalignment of the numbers in these
reports.  Other claims, such as fear of disclosing
corporate secrets to competitors, seem nonsensical
and downright moronic as anyone has free access
to SEC documents.


The numbers are not just o� because of di�erent
GAAP standards or maybe some accounting
practice, the di�erence between the two is as wide
as the Great Wall.  Just take a look.


2008 Filings Disclosures SAIC SEC


Cash 100,000 64,300,000


Accounts Receivable 1,000,000 13,200,000


Revenues 500,000 42,300,000


Gross Pro�ts 200,000 30,000,000


Net income (1,200,000) 17,500,000


Now the “longs” or in this case people who are
about to apologize to Citron will argue that these
are not audited and the company is lying to China
and telling the truth to US regulators and the
investing public.


LOLOL


CHBT’s SAIC �lings are audited.  Just go to page 80
of the �lings and you will see the audit report of a
top 100 Chinese accounting �rm.

And as for lying to the Chinese Government but not
the SEC, you want us to believe that management
who lives and pays taxes in China, where white
collar crime can be punishable by death, will lie to
the Chinese Government but they will not lie to the
SEC?  And why are we supposed to believe this ?
 C’mon … if only the stock market was always this
easy. 
The fate of CSKI is an interesting tell.  That company
too had massive discrepancies between SAIC and
SEC disclosures.  Now, the company �nally
confesses that “some distributors”, under pressure
from Chinese regulators, suddenly don’t want to
play ball, a resigned CFO, an ugly restatement, a
formal investigation and subpoena from the SEC,
and a 50% haircut later, reality has extracted its
price … on the suckers.  Good luck suing ’em now.


The Company’s Response


Well heck, they had to say something.  On Friday
September 10, the company released a statement
commenting on their stock.

In it they don’t defend their alleged stores claim
explicitly.  Instead they state that there are “market
rumors”.  Where are the rumors?? These are facts.  
The generic press release blaming the shorts is so
old, tired, and predictable.   Cmon, you could have
at least signed a distribution deal with Santa Claus
to bring your products to all the boys and girls of
the world.


Corporate Credibility


One of the big corporate news story over the past
few months was the �ring of Mark Hurd from HP
for fudging an insigni�cant amount on an expense

report.  While this might have been a bit extreme, it
shows Wall Street operates with zero tolerance for
lying.


What amazes Citron is that the longs in this stock
are proud of management’s ability to selectively lie. 
It is OK to lie about the stores… because it is now
just a small part of their future revenue
projections.  Well, it wasn’t such a small part of the
company’s revenues when they used that very track
record from those “branded stores” to raise $75
million from US investors.


(we think the only fair thing for the company to do
is o�er the secondary buyers their money back
immediately. )


Meanwhile, is it also OK to lie to the Chinese
Government?  We are sure there will be a great
story as to where the money is now.


Citron believes that the whole business model is a
lie from top to bottom and management has zero
credibility to say anything di�erent.


Don’t forget the old adage:  At every poker game
there is a sucker, and if you don’t know who the
sucker is, it is you… You have been warned.
