Will CSKI’s Auditor Sign off on CSKI’s 10-K?


Posted on March 10, 2010 by Asensio.com


A report issued by asensio.com yesterday revealed that Moore


Stephens, P.C., the accounting firm that serves as auditor to China


Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI), is the subject of a lawsuit.


The complaint against Moore Stephens alleges that the accounting


firm is liable for securities fraud in issuing an unqualified opinion


letter on CSKI’s audited financial statements and not correcting its


opinion when it knew or should have known that CSKI’s financial


statements were materially inaccurate.


It is unclear whether this lawsuit could make Moore Stephens


withhold or withdraw an opinion on CSKI’s 2009 financial


statements. Today CSKI announced that it will release earnings for


the fourth quarter of 2009 on March 17, 2010.


The complaint alleges that the material inaccuracies in CSKI’s


financial statements include a line-item representing approximately


15% of CSKI’s total assets at December 31, 2008.


The claims against Moore Stephens seem to have merit, in that the


complaint provides evidence that CSKI did not own the patents that


it claimed to own in its 2008 10-K and that it stated were worth


more than $15 million in its financial statements, which Moore


Stephens audited and approved.


The complaint states that a report on the non-existence of CSKI’s


patents was sent to Moore Stephens. The complaint states that


Moore Stephens therefore had knowledge of the material


inaccuracies in CSKI’s financial statements and should have


corrected its opinion.


CSKI may face liability as an outcome of the legal action in having to


write-off the value of its supposed “patents.”

Moore Stephens could face primary liability for securities fraud. It


could also face action from the Public Company Accounting


Oversight Board (“PCAOB”), which oversees auditors of public


companies, or from the SEC, which oversees the PCAOB.
