Since early May, and even accounting for yesterday’s plunge, shares of small TV


production company Genius Brands have appreciated in value by more than 20x on


relatively mundane news. We think the stock will drop as quickly as it skyrocketed.


The company itself appears to agree with us, believing its shares are worth $0.35 to


$1.20 per share, 83%-95% below current levels, based on three �nancing rounds it


completed at those prices last month alone.


Retail investors seem entirely unaware that ~131 million shares and share equivalents


issued from recent �nancing rounds will become available to trade within an estimated 2-


4 weeks. We walk bagholders readers through how this upcoming wall of selling pressure


could send the high-�ying shares back to $1.50 within a month.


The stock currently trades at a fully diluted market cap of ~$1.56 billion, a�ording it a


ludicrous revenue multiple of 1,201x based on its $1.3 million in annualized revenue. The


company has generated losses every quarter for almost 10 straight years.


We also walk readers through issues with the actual business. For example, the company


hasn’t disclosed that its �agship show, Rainbow Rangers, has not yet been renewed for a


new season on key network Nick Jr., and it is unclear whether it will be.


Rainbow Rangers aired 26 times per week when it �rst debuted on Nick Jr. in 2019. Now,


the show only airs ~9 times per week, at 3:49am EST during weekdays and Saturdays and


twice Sunday mornings between 6am and 7am; hardly primetime.


A Bagholder’s Guide to Why We Think
Genius Brands Will Be a $1.50 Stock Within
a Month


Published on June 5, 2020
The company’s other key show is Llama Llama, based on a popular series of children’s


books. But the company doesn’t actually own the intellectual property to Llama Llama –


instead merely licensing it. The company has refused to disclose the economic terms of


the deal, but the lack of reported revenue indicates the terms are not economical.


Stock runs are always fueled by exciting stories, but the ending is almost always written in


the boring �ne print. We think Genius Brands will crash spectacularly due to obvious


market mechanics that its retail investor base are likely unfamiliar with – even in the


frothiest of markets.


Genius Brands’ Meteoric Stock Price Rise


In early May, children’s television production company Genius Brands International issued a


press release (https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1060/genius-


brands-international-to-launch-kartoon-channel) announcing it was merging its two existing TV


channels into one, to be called the “Kartoon Channel”. It also announced plans to integrate


3,000 episodes of acquired content “including hit programs form (sic) key content suppliers


around the world.”


The company declared its new TV channel to be the “economic vaccine for COVID-19.”


The press release included no numbers about revenue implications and seemed to be a rather


run-of-the-mill corporate streamlining announcement, devoid of material positives.


Nonetheless, the news lit the spark for what would become a momentous stock run. Genius’


shares closed the day of the announcement at $0.48, a 52% increase from the prior day’s close,


on over 34 million shares of volume, roughly 30x normal levels.


Day traders determined that the company was now “Net�ix for Kids” and, with the bene�t of


some upward momentum, a con�rmation bias feedback loop quickly turned Genius into the


hottest speculative stock on the market.


Since the day of its Kartoon announcement, Genius has climbed as high as $12 per share on


almost 400 million shares of volume traded in a single session. With over 220 million fully


diluted shares outstanding, the stock currently trades at a market cap of ~$1.56 billion. [1] [Pg.

Retail stock forums from Reddit to StockTwits have been alight with countless rocket ship


emojis and giddy traders gloating over paper gains. Robinhood users owning the name have


jumped from about 5,000 to over 140,000, according to RobinTrack


(http://robintrack.net/symbol/GNUS).


Reality Check: Even the Company Only Thinks Its Shares
Are Worth �0.35 to �1.20, Representing Downside of
83%-95%


The price at which a company sells its own stock to fund its business can be a key indicator of


what management thinks its stock/company is actually worth.


Obviously, a management team isn’t going to issue stock at low prices if it thinks its valuation


will move higher in short order. Companies have a vested interest in issuing shares when their


valuation looks favorable, in order to minimize the dilutive e�ects of issuing new equity.


With that in mind, the company raised 3 �nancing rounds from May 7  to 12  at prices


ranging from $0.35 (https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-


releases/detail/1061/genius-brands-international-announces-2-8-million) to $1.20


(https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1064/genius-brands-


international-announces-9-0-million), 83%-95% below current levels as of this writing.


This means that in addition to management tacitly putting a $1.20 price target on its own stock,


management would likely to go to the market and attempt to sell more stock at the company’s


current valuation – if the stock wasn’t slated to get demolished in the short term, which we


believe it is.


Reality Check: 131 Million Shares Are Likely to Hit The
Market Within 2-4 Weeks, Creating a Massive Amount of
Selling Pressure


Just as an exciting story is always the fuel to a massive stock run, the tragic ending is often


written in the mundane �ne print.


A review of Genius’ recent multitude of stock o�erings makes clear that its �nancial backers are


likely weeks away from be able to sell a wall of stock that is almost assuredly going to send


shares sharply lower.

https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1064/genius-brands-international-announces-9-0-million
In March, the company completed a �nancing that sold convertible notes and warrants to its


own CEO (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/17/2001972/0/en/GENIUS-


BRANDS-INTERNATIONAL-COMPLETES-11-0-MILLION-CONVERTIBLE-DEBT-FINANCING.html)


and other investors that collectively convert into ~131 million shares of common stock at a


strike price of $0.21. [Pg. 2


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820000763/genius_8k-

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820001851/genius_s3-


060320.htm)]


Most �nanciers that participate in such private placements buy the stock at a slight discount to


market prices. The discount compensates them for the risk of temporarily being unable to sell


the shares. Such �nanciers are often looking to make small arbitrage gains by locking in the


di�erence between the trading price and the discounted price they purchase at. That arbitrage


can typically only be truly locked in when shares are registered and the SEC approves a “notice


of e�ectiveness” to sell the shares on the open market.


Given the meteoric rise of Genius’s stock, those �nanciers are likely sitting on outsized paper


gains, waiting for the opportunity to lock in pro�ts from the retail bonanza fueling the stock


price. Yesterday, the company �led a prospectus statement


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820001851/genius_s3-


060320.htm) that seeks to allow those very holders to sell almost half of those shares. We


expect a follow-up �ling will cover the remainder.


The timeline for when the SEC approves the “notice of e�ectiveness” can vary, but based on


recent history, it took 10 days for the company’s last S-3 �ling


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820000183/0001683168-20-


000183-index.htm) to become e�ective


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/999999999520000170/9999999995-20-


000170-index.htm). That suggests an e�ectiveness around June 14 , coinciding with the


company’s planned launch of the Kartoon Network on June 15 .


Once that notice of e�ectiveness is active, a new wave of selling is likely to pummel the stock as


its �nancial backers rush to lock in pro�ts. Any readers that have not exited by then are, in our


estimation, likely to get decimated.


Reality Check: Company Fundamentals Can’t Support the
Stock’s Astronomical Price

Readers hoping for the company’s fundamentals to save them are not likely to receive any


help.


The company’s annual revenue run rate is ~$1.3 million (last quarter’s revenue was only $335


thousand [Pg. 4


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820001639/genius_10q-


20200331.htm)]), a�ording it a ludicrous 1,201x revenue multiple. According to FactSet, the


company has lost money every single quarter since 2010 and has consistently tapped the


capital markets for cash, often on the back of promotional announcements that routinely end


up delayed or abandoned.


Reality Check: The Company’s Business Is Not the
Powerhouse Shareholders Might Think It Is, As Seen When
Reviewing its 3 Most Important Shows


Some readers might be saying “well sure the fundamentals are terrible but Net�ix (and most of


the other stocks I like) also have atrocious fundamentals.”


Stocks with an appealing story can perform well for a period of time. But a story with some


stock momentum make for a fragile investment foundation.


And the company’s story has major holes. Genius’s top 3 publicized


(https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1058/genius-brands-


international-issues-shareholder-letter)shows are Llama Llama, Rainbow Rangers, and Stan


Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten.


To be frank, we don’t think most investors in Genius are terribly familiar with the details of the


key television shows they now own, so here is a quick breakdown:


1. Llama Llama is Its Most Popular Show, but the Company Doesn’t Own the
Intellectual Property and Only Has a Licensing Deal, With Undisclosed (But
Clearly Minimal) Economic Bene�t


Llama Llama is a show that airs on Net�ix based on the popular children’s book series


(http://www.llamallamabook.com/books/). These shows are the most popular of the company’s


current lineup. However, Genius doesn’t own the intellectual property behind Llama Llama, as


it simply “represent(s) their content as a licensing agent” [Pg. 5


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316817000744/genius_10k-


123116.htm)]



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316820001639/genius_10q-20200331.htm

https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-releases/detail/1058/genius-brands-international-issues-shareholder-letter

http://www.llamallamabook.com/books/

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1355848/000168316817000744/genius_10k-123116.htm
The content deal was announced (https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-


releases/detail/794/genius-brands-international-partners-with-penguin-young) in 2015, but


terms weren’t disclosed. We asked the company for details and investor relations responded


with an answer that should alarm anyone looking to understand Genius’s �nancials:


“We do not disclose any economic information about our shows or properties.”


Based on the company’s limited revenue and consistent losses to date it doesn’t appear to be a


particularly lucrative contract.


2. Rainbow Rangers—The Company Has Boasted That the Show Is Currently
Airing on Nick Jr. True, But It Appears Once Per Day During the Week at 3:49AM
EST And Three Times On Sundays. The Show Is Currently Not Yet Slated For a
3  Season and It Is Unclear Whether It Will Be Renewed.


Rainbow Rangers is another key show for the company, and in this case Genius does own the


intellectual property behind the show, making it perhaps the company’s most economically


relevant property. It airs on Nick Jr. and has completed 2 seasons to date.  


The company made a big deal about its pick-up by Nick Jr. in a January 2019 press release


(https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/15/1691753/0/en/Genius-Brands-


International-Inc-Issues-Shareholder-Letter.html) announcing that the show had 455,000


viewers in its premiere:


“We have just received the Nielsen ratings for our latest premiere episode (Sunday,


Jan. 6) of Rainbow Rangers on Nick Jr., which generated our highest premiere episode


rating to date with 455,000 viewers!


The premiere episodes are broadcast on Sundays at 11:30 AM, and the encore


episodes are broadcast Monday through Friday in the afternoon.


And, the strong and growing viewership on Nick Jr. points to an increasing appetite by


kids for Rainbow Rangers and the coming tsunami of products at retail.” The press


release says.

https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/01/15/1691753/0/en/Genius-Brands-International-Inc-Issues-Shareholder-Letter.html
Then, the company stated (https://www.globenewswire.com/news-


release/2020/03/17/2002064/0/en/NICKELODEON-EXPANDS-DAILY-BROADCAST-OF-GENIUS-


BRANDS-INTERNATIONAL-S-HIT-PRESCHOOL-SERIES-RAINBOW-RANGERS.html) in March 2020


that it was airing 26 times per week, giving it broad coverage in apparently favorable time


slots:


“Monday-Friday, four airings per day, and six airings on the weekends. The animated


action-adventure series premiered on Nick Jr. in November 2018 with �ve airings per


week and has consistently achieved high ratings with its target demo of Girls 2–5-


years-old.”


But the Rainbow Rangers schedule now says otherwise. Most weekdays look like this


schedule (https://www.ontvtonight.com/guide/listings/channel/69047681/nick-jr.html), from


yesterday, where the show has one time slot on Nick Jr. at 3:49AM EST.



https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/03/17/2002064/0/en/NICKELODEON-EXPANDS-DAILY-BROADCAST-OF-GENIUS-BRANDS-INTERNATIONAL-S-HIT-PRESCHOOL-SERIES-RAINBOW-RANGERS.html

https://www.ontvtonight.com/guide/listings/channel/69047681/nick-jr.html
Several platforms show us the same, indicating it airs 9 times per week, instead of 26: each


morning at 3:49am and then twice additionally on Sunday mornings at 6:00a and 6:30a EST. We


emailed the company to ask about its current number of airings and have not heard back as of


this writing.


As Genius’s CEO said in the March 2020 press release regarding the show being aired 26 times:


“Needless to say, leading broadcasters like Nickelodeon don’t make schedule changes


of this magnitude without good reason…”


He has not commented thus far on the “good reason” for the show airing in the witching hours


of early morning only 9 times per week.


Similarly, there is no indication that a Season 3 has been picked up by Nick Jr. We e-mailed both


Nick Jr. the company to try to get con�rmation of a Season 3 but investor relations simply


stated that negotiations were “underway”.


We �nd it surprising that Nick Jr. is still in negotiations. Other shows such as “PAW Patrol”


“Blues Clues” and “Bubble Guppies” were already announced as being picked up by


Nickelodeon in February (https://www.thewrap.com/nickelodeon-are-you-afraid-of-the-dark-


renewed/). Season 2 of Rainbow Rangers was ordered


(https://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/nickelodeon-greenlights-rainbow-rangers-s2-from-


genius-brands/) in April of 2019 in preparation for its release in October. We are now in June


2020 with no word on the series heading into the fall.


3. Stan Lee’s SuperHero Kindergarten Is Targeted to Air in Q1, A�er Almost 10
Years of Apparent Delays. In the Interim, Stan Lee Has Passed Away.


Stan Lee’s Superhero Kindergarten, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, is another show being


created by the company targeting (https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-


releases/detail/1058/genius-brands-international-issues-shareholder-letter) to be aired in Q1


2021.


The company has been attempting to launch the show


(https://www.�ickeringmyth.com/2011/03/could-arnold-schwarzeneggers/) since as early as


2011 on a major network. In the interim, legendary comic book writer Stan Lee sadly passed


away in November 2018 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee).

https://www.flickeringmyth.com/2011/03/could-arnold-schwarzeneggers/

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stan_Lee
The company announced (https://www.gnusbrands.com/news-media/press-


releases/detail/1058/genius-brands-international-issues-shareholder-letter) recently it would


be launching the show on Amazon. No economic terms were disclosed, but the company


hyped that it would be “plutonium in a bottle” for shareholders.


Amazon produces some of its own content, but the announcement made no indication that


Amazon was paying Genius for the show. For most Amazon Prime content


(https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?


url=https%3A%2F%2Fvariety.com%2F2019%2Fdigital%2Fnews%2Famazon-prime-video-direct-

sdata=2KajAzQ8l16ppvzxHRKxnVYMWv5ZdXiq2z83QHmYB%2BQ%3D&reserved=0), Amazon


pays content suppliers a per hourly rate based on viewership, or they split the rental or


subscription revenue.


In other words, the company is likely simply posting its content on Amazon and self-marketing


the show, a far less exciting achievement than suggested. It is not entirely clear how it intends


to reach kindergarten audiences given that Stan Lee is no longer with us and Arnold


Schwarzenegger likely has little brand recognition among young children.


All told, we just don’t see the company magically growing into its current absurd valuation, and


the shareholders waiting to register 131 million shares for sale are likely acutely aware of this.


Conclusion: Why We Think Genius Brands Will Be a �1.50
Stock Within a Month


There are several factors that we expect will send shares down rapidly in short order:


1. A massive slew of ~131 million shares that are coming available for sale, likely within


weeks, that currently represent a nominal value of $917 million in selling pressure as of


current prices (which, realistically, we do not expect to hold up).


2. The availability of options, allowing investors to hedge and/or position ahead of the


pending selling pressure.


3. The reversal of retail momentum. New traders are notoriously focused on the next


shiny object, and when Genius loses its luster it is likely to quickly get dropped to the curb


in favor of other junky story stocks.

perspective they’re being transparent & EVERY other company Hindenburg has articles on,


their research has proven itself in their favor.


BTW you too can short the stock if you like, unless you believe this is �awed, then go long…..
