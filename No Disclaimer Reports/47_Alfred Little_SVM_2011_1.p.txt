SilverCorp Management Fails To Refute Evidence Its Earnings Are Off
5X

SilverCorp Metals (NYSE and TSE: SVM) management asserts that its key operating
subsidiary Henan Found Mining Co. Ltd. ("Henan Found") is highly profitable, having
made 850,723,013 RMB ($125 million) combined net income in 2009 and 2010
attributable to its two shareholders as follows:


77.5% to Victor Mining Ltd., SVM's 100% owned offshore subsidiary
22.5% to Henan Non-Ferrous Geological Mineral Resources Co., Ltd.
("HNGMR"), SVM's Chinese State-owned JV partner


Under Chinese international accounting standards, HNGMR reports its 22.5% share of
Henan Found's net income as investment income on its audited financials. We obtained
original stamped copies of HNGMR's audited 2009 and 2010 financials (available here
with translation here) that in our experience should be highly reliable due to the fact that
HNGMR is a Chinese state-owned enterprise ("SOE") with no incentive to hide earnings
or evade tax. HNGMR includes its share of earnings from Henan Found along with
earnings from minority stakes in five other companies. To determine precisely the amount
of proportional income from its 22.5% investment in Henan Found, we obtained the
financials of each of HNGMR's five other minority holdings (available here). From these
records we calculated the amount of HNGMR's investment income from Henan Found as
shown in the following table that breaks down the sources and amounts of HNGMR's
investment income in 2009 and 2010:

HNGMR's share of income from its investment in Henan Found for 2010 was only
22,118,311 RMB, or 93,708,627 RMB less than the 115,826,938 RMB that Henan Found
reported, a difference of 524%.There is no possible excuse for this variance. This
strongly indicates that Henan Found's 2010 earnings disclosed by SVM are likewise
overstated by 524%.


In 2010 Henan Found was SVM's only profitable subsidiary. Hence SVM's reported net
income appears to be overstated by at least 5X.


SVM management responded (here, page 8) by disclosing that an "allocation exists"
whereby 70% of HNGMR's dividend from Henan Found is actually paid to a never before
disclosed additional non-controlling interest holder of Henan Found they abbreviate
"HNGMR's 1st Bridge" without providing the legal name of this "separate legal entity" for
investigators to be able to verify its existence, ownership or financial records. A thorough
search found no such separate legal entity in the ownership records of Henan Found or
HNGMR.


Our analysis above shows that HNGMR's investment income reported for 2010 from
Henan Found is less than 1/5th of the amount Henan Found reported paying. Rather than
explaining this serious discrepancy SVM management simply changed the subject and
offered up a false and confusing look at dividend payments from Henan Found to HNGMR
and the undisclosed "1st Bridge" entity.


SVM management falsely claims that HNGMR and the "1st Bridge" entity are subject to an
additional 12.5% tax on dividend payments from Henan Found. There has been no such
tax in China since January 1st, 2008.


According to the Income Tax Law published in 2007 (link here for the Tax Law and here for
its Implementation), the dividend or bonus received by a resident enterprise for its
investment in another resident enterprise is exempt from the income tax. As Henan Found
and HNGMR are both resident enterprises, the dividend Henan Found paid to HNGMR is
exempt from tax.


To completely disprove SVM management's claim, let's assume HNGMR did pay the
12.5% income tax on the dividends from Henan Found. SVM claims this tax payable
amounted to 2,883,022 and 3,437,125 RMB in 2009 and 2010.


If we take a look at HNGMR's financial reports, we see pretax profits for 2009 and 2010 of
20,213,989 and 31,065,876 RMB, respectively. Income tax payable is only 175,783 and
373,865 RMB for 2009 and 2010, respectively, completely inconsistent with the tax
