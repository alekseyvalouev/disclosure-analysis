5/19/2018 Your Capital at Risk Part 1: Short Plus500 | Cable Car Capital LLC


http://www.cablecarcapital.com/your-capital-at-risk-part-1/ 2/11


On May 18, Plus500 declined 36% due to news of a significant number of UK accounts being frozen
pending customer verification to comply with anti-money laundering (AML) rules. Shares have
continued to decline this week, while most discussion has focused on the narrow impact of the
account freeze. According to the company’s statement, the AML review is merely a temporary
procedural setback affecting a subset of accounts representing no more than 50% of revenues. If so,
the market would appear to have once again overreacted to a short-term scare about the sustainability
of Plus500′s business model. Alternatively, this could represent the beginning of increased regulatory
scrutiny that may ultimately impair the company’s ability to continue as a going concern.


Irrespective of the effects of the AML review, Plus500 remains dramatically overvalued in my opinion.
A host of red flags unrelated to the recent news leave me skeptical of the company’s claims about its
business, including inconsistencies among public filings, an undisclosed subsidiary, evidence of
extralegal behavior by predecessor and affiliated entities, and a material accounting discrepancy
between Group and subsidiary accounts.


In my preview post on Monday, I compared the 2013 and 2014 accounts of Plus500UK, the regulated
subsidiary currently undergoing additional AML review. The 2014 accounts restated 2013 revenues,
reducing them 80% from GBP 63.8 to GBP 12.8 million. Plus500 has yet to explain this restatement or
reclassification of revenues in a regulatory filing. That omission alone leads me to believe trading
in Plus500 shares should be suspended until the company clarifies its accounts.


In a departure from previous years, the 2014 audited Group accounts were prepared prior to the audit
of Plus500UK being completed. The 2014 Group audit is dated 16 March 2015, while the 2014
Plus500UK audit is dated 10 April 2015.


The turnover figures reported in the 2014 Plus500UK subsidiary accounts represent approximately
17.5% of 2014 and 17.4% of 2013 Group reported revenues, down from 86.8% in 2013 as originally
reported. Not only is this level of revenue for Plus500UK inconsistent with the ca. 50% referenced in
the company’s May 18 statement, but the explanation provided in response to a journalist’s inquiry is
inconsistent with past disclosures regarding the proportion of revenue generated by customers
domiciled in the UK (16% in 2014 and 15% in 2013) as well as the inter-company agreement
governing transfer payments (see section 15.6 of the Admission Document) to the Israeli parent. The
new Plus500UK revenues for 2013 can only be reconciled with the reported revenue of the Group if
the amount of revenue generated outside of the regulated UK entity, prior to the Cyprus license, were
substantially higher than previously reported, or there was a material change to the inter-company
agreement, which has not yet been disclosed by the company. Otherwise, Group revenues for 2013
and 2014 appear to be overstated several times over.


If you read only one other post in this series, let it be Part 4, in which I discuss this and other
inconsistencies among the Plus500UK subsidiary reports and the Group filings.

http://www.cablecarcapital.com/your-capital-at-risk-part-1/ 3/11


My aim in this series of blog posts is not to duplicate the excellent work of Dan McCrum at the
Financial Times, who has written a 12-part series on Plus500 that raises a number of important
questions about the company’s promotion practices, churn, and business model. I agree with much of
his assessment.


In contrast to a typical short seller’s report, my purpose is also not to level allegations of wrongdoing at
the company, its auditors, or management. My goal is instead to document the unanswered questions
that have motivated my positioning. I have no way to verify how accurately the reported financials
reflect the actual condition of the company. I have structured this report as a ten-part series of blog
posts in order to discuss topics in free form and link to a variety of primary source documents from my
research.


Past short arguments and journalist reports have not discussed the full background of the company or
documented the full extent of the discrepancies among public filings and management statements. I
am operating under the presumption that the audited financial statements fairly and accurately present
the financial position of the company, while also pointing out issues I have not been able to reconcile. I
welcome constructive feedback and look forward to clarifications from the company.


Plus500 advertisements contain a somewhat cheeky disclaimer reminding prospective customers that
“Your Capital is at Risk.” This series of articles may perhaps serve as a reminder to shareholders and
prospective investors that your capital is at risk too.





On to Part 2: Plus500 is a Bucket Shop –>


Thank you to FB and EM for feedback during the research process.

It is my firm opinion, based on a months long research, that there is more to this whole story. 


Do not be surprised if and when it comes to surface that the former CEO “Dror Sordo” does


not exist and is a product of imagination and invention. So far, according to research, and again this is my


personal opinion (sue me), no person with that name and/or with a passport in this name, has ever set foot on


British soil. 


This would render all accounting of Plus500UK Ltd. moot. Plus500UK Ltd. was the only asset that Plus500 Ltd.


had at the time of going public. 


On top of everything, I’ve said this before: Plus500 Ltd., listed on the AIM, is NOT LICENSED to conduct any

financial business in the first place. A fact that authorities seem to neglect. 


Bob Dylan once sang: In Jersey everything is legal as long as you don’t get caught. 


This appears to apply to the AIM and the authorities because nobody is doing any catching anyway
