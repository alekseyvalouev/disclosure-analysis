Does AFSI's Audit
Committee Have
To Investigate?
Looks That Way...
Jan. 16, 2015 2:35 PM ET | Includes: AmTrust Financial Ser…


Introduction


Recent case studies indicate an AFSI audit committee investigation is likely.
AFSI may not be able to file their 10-K if an investigation is opened and
remains open.
Delayed 10-K and/or restatement could prompt liquidity problems at AFSI.


Introduction


Alistair Capital recently sent a letter to AmTrust Financial Services Inc.
(NASDAQ:AFSI)'s audit committee.


How AFSI reacts will be important to what the stock does...I suspect the
answer will be: "Yes, we're investigating...and the 10-K will be filed
late."


Recent Case Studies of Audit Committee Investigations Indicate an
Audit Committee Investigation is Likely


Examples of audit committee investigations are prevalent and the treatment of
a well-documented allegation of potential fraud appears to be relatively well-
established.


Montage: Detailed Company Response...Audit Committee Still Investigated


On February 6, 2014, Gravity Research published a report critical of


Four days later, Montage issued a detailed response, clearly indicating they
disagreed with Gravity's allegations.

Despite that, Montage's audit committee hired independent counsel to review
the allegations just two weeks later:


“ In addition, Montage provided the following update regarding allegationsmade in short seller reports under the banner of Gravity Research. As
Montage has previously stated, it believes these allegations are
misleading and contain numerous errors of fact. As an additional
measure, Montage's Audit Committee has appointed the global law firm
Jones Day to conduct an independent review of the allegations and
related matters. The Company believes the results of this
independent review will further demonstrate that the allegations
by Gravity Research lack merit.


This clearly demonstrates that even though the allegation came from a
short-seller and the company responded in a detailed way, the audit
committee felt compelled to investigate.


AgFeed: An Internal Investigation Is Not Enough


In March 2014, the SEC filed a complaint against former executives of AgFeed
(OTC:FEED) including the chairman of the audit committee (for his role as
chairman of the audit committee).


Among the allegations against Ivan Gothner, the Chairman of FEED's audit
committee, the SEC faulted him for "failure to conduct further meaningful
inquiries into the fraud even as additional red flags arose."


From the complaint:


“ In response to receiving this information, Gothner contacted a formerAgFeed director and then-current company advisor, who recommended in
an e-mail dated May 9, 2011, that AgFeed hire professional investigators,
guided by outside legal counsel, to conduct an investigation. In this email,
the advisor told Gothner that the "Jiangxi issues" were "not just smoke
but fire." Rather than hire professional investigators, however, Gothner
directed certain members of management, including Pazdro, to travel to
China and investigate.

Clearly the SEC does not take kindly to members of the audit
committee ignoring serious allegations of fraud and they willgo after
members of the audit committee who shirk their duties.


ArthroCare: Auditors Cannot Ignore Short Seller Allegations


Even if somehow the audit committee were willing to take on the significant
personal liability of not investigating the matters raised directly to it, it's
unlikely BDO, AFSI's auditor will sign off on the financial statements. The
ArthroCare case demonstrates why.


According to the PCAOB press release:


“ The [PCAOB] Board found that Stone ignored or failed to properlyevaluate numerous indicators that should have alerted him to the
possibility that ArthroCare was improperly recognizing revenue on its
2007 sales of medical devices to DiscoCare, Inc. Such indicators included
unusual pricing and payment terms, quarter-end sales spikes, and
evidence that ArthroCare may have funded DiscoCare's purchases
through monthly service fee payments. Sales to DiscoCare helped
ArthroCare meet its revenue forecasts for 2007.


Once again, just because the allegations come from a short seller doesn't
mean they can be ignored:


“ 61. Stone learned no later than early December 2007 thatallegations ofpotential wrongdoing were being made against ArthroCare by short
sellers, which focused on the Company's relationship with DiscoCare.
These allegations intensified after ArthroCare's acquisition of DiscoCare
became public in early January 2008.


Management representations that everything is fine (as AFSI is prone to):

“ 62. In response, Stone's engagement team obtained representations thatArthroCare's management had "reviewed the relationships and is
confident that their relationships with the doctors['] offices are legal and
that these allegations are without merit" and that management was "not
aware of any illegal activity."...
In connection with the 2007 audit, Stone accepted management's
representations regarding the short seller allegations, ultimately
concluding that they did not appear to have merit.


AFSI's auditors (or at least their lawyers) have likely taken note of this case,
the ruling for which was in July 2014. As such, even if the audit committee
were willing to go without an investigation, BDO might force them to
do an investigation.


Open Investigations Tend to Lead to Delayed Financial Statements


If the audit committee does indeed investigate the accounting
concerns raised to them directly, the company is likely to have to
delay it's 10-K filing.


Examples of such audit committee investigations causing delays in recent
years include:


Diamond Foods (NASDAQ:DMND)
Logitech (NASDAQ:LOGI)
Fabrinet (NYSE:FN)
American Realty Capital Properties (ARCP)


If AFSI is unable to file it's financial statements in a timely manner, creditors
may be less than anxious to offer waivers (let alone if the company does have
to restate earning significantly, as I believe they will).


If AFSI loses access to credit, their liquidity would rapidly dry up and reveal
what I believe is an insolvent insurer.


Price Target: $0.
