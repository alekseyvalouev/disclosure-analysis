Ziopharm Oncology: 5 Potential Downsides To Its New Deal

by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Ziopharm doesn’t have the money to successfully pull off its new licensing deal. So
we believe it will have to sell stock, posing imminent dilution.


A “highly sensitive and confidential” letter details $15 million-worth of stock offered
by Ziopharm and its partner as incentive to speed contract signing.


Technology uses “Sleeping Beauty,” an older way of putting genes into cells to kill
tumors. The method may be safe, a doctor says, but may be because it’s less
effective.


This technology fell behind at the get-go. Novartis leads the field of rivals with CAR-
T cancer therapy and it would take years of catch-up for Ziopharm to gain FDA
consideration.


Ziopharm has quite the promotional history, increasing chances that this
experimental technique also won't develop into a commercial product. Ziopharm will
likely soon be looking for a new story.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


Shares of Boston, Mass.-based Ziopharm Oncology (ZIOP) ripped some 54 percent within
hours on a positive news story this week - a story full of holes and investor risks.


The stock raced from $5.74 up to $9.50 following the announcement that ZIOP and its
partner Intrexon Corp. (XON) signed a licensing agreement with the Texas cancer center,
MD Anderson.


Though the share price has fallen, the excitement delivered a roughly $900 million
valuation to a company with a $362 million deficit and no product.


The deal trades licensing rights for MD Anderson's non-approved cancer technology for
$100 million worth of shares from both ZIOP and XON. ZIOP has also committed to
paying $15 million to $20 million yearly to the cancer center for research and development
for three years, though the press release is fuzzy. ZIOP must pay the first $3.75 million
within two months.

Ominous details surround ZIOP's dollar-and-dilution deal, as well as ZIOP itself. Here are
the top five reasons why TheStreetSweeper dislikes this deal and sees loads of downside
ahead:


1. ZIOP doesn't have the money to pull off this deal. So we believe ZIOP will have to
sell stock, posing imminent dilution.


ZIOP has just $46 million in cash. Its own quarterly report says that's "sufficient to fund
operations into the fourth quarter of 2015."


But that was before the new agreement. ZIOP is burning over $7 million per quarter. And it
is now committed to pay about half that much - $3.75 million to $4 million quarterly - to
The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston each quarter for three
years.


2. Shares worth $15 million offered as incentive to speed contract signing.


The day ZIOP was scheduled to present to JP Morgan, Jan. 14, turns out to be the very
day ZIOP pulled this licensing announcement out of its ear. JP Morgan acted as
underwriter during ZIOP's roughly $54 million public offering in October 2013 at $3.50 per
share.


But that timing apparently was not mere coincidence.


This "highly sensitive and confidential" letter to a University of Texas vice president of
strategic industry ventures describes $15 million worth of incentive shares - 1.6 million
ZIOP shares and 278,218 XON shares - not included in the licensing agreement, to hand
to MD Anderson to speed up the expected 120-day contract approval process. That way,
the chief executives of ZIOP and XON who signed the letter would be able to issue the
public announcement during the JP Morgan conference. The letter stated:


"Specifically, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference is being held next week in San
Francisco, and on Wednesday during the Conference, the Licensee Group would like to
issue a public announcement about the execution of the license agreement.
Consequently, the Licensee Group would like to induce and incentivize MD Anderson to
undertake any and all extraordinary efforts to expedite and/or shorten its contracting,
review and approval processes and to conclude and execute the license agreement on or
before 8:00 am PST, on January 14, 2015 (the "Accelerated Closing Deadline")."


3. ZIOP has a history of heavy promotion, followed by disappointment.

It goes like this: shares falter so ZIOP runs out a story on a promising
technology/drug/update, shares soar, shares collapse on a trial flop (its palifosfamide
sarcoma study of 2013), repeat. And so it goes. But at some point, everyone quits falling
for the story and waits for results, rather than facing another costly disappointment.


4. The MD Anderson technology uses "Sleeping Beauty," an older way of putting
genes into cells.


The body contains T-cells within the immune system that kill a virus or infection. Now,
researchers are removing T-cells and putting genes in them that then attack the tumor. But
the process results in side-effects that can make the patient very sick. MD Anderson's
technology doesn't cause a lot of side effects, but a doctor who asked to remain
anonymous, said it may be because it's less effective in killing tumor cells.


5. This experimental therapy lagged behind that of bigger competitors at the get-go.


Novartis, Juno Therapeutics and Kite Pharma are all up front with their own "CAR-T"
cancer immunotherapy. These massive companies are way ahead of the MD Anderson
technology, the doctor who is familiar with the technology told TheStreetSweeper.


"It's a very competitive space," he said. "Theirs does not seem like best of breed and
they're way behind."


Starting out behind is a big problem. It takes many years to conduct trials to even get an
experimental drug or technology ready to be considered for Food and Drug Administration
approval.


No way is ZIOP a nearly $1 billion company, the doctor told TheStreetSweeper. And we
agree. To be worth so much, it would have to be more than a no-name company with
nothing but operating losses since inception and mounting extensive financial obligations.
A $1 billion company would at least have a product and a recognizable name. But we
expect reality will hit and ZIOP's valuation will swoon back to earth very soon. We don't
expect to wait long.
