Insulet President Provided Critical Misinformation, Misled Investors


I. Overview of PODD recent key competitive commentary
 
In all three (3) of our previous reports on Insulet Corporation’s (PODD) we addressed Medtronic Plc’s (MDT)
recently approved next-gen insulin pump known as the 670G. We have conducted a substantial amount of
research of this product o�ering and its expected near-term impact on competition in the insulin pump
sector. We previously detailed how Dexcom, Inc. (DXCM), Tandem Diabetes Care Inc. (TNDM) and MDT all
con�rmed that the 670G’s impending launch in the spring of 2017 was negatively impacting their businesses
right now. The general theme explained by these companies was that patients know the 670G and other
innovative products are coming to market soon so they are waiting for those products rather than buying the
currently o�ered insulin pumps. We explained that PODD is the only insulin pump manufacturer we know of
who has recently claimed that the 670G is not impacting their business. We found this curious so we
conducted some additional research to determine if this claim by PODD was plausible.
 
II. PODD con�rms MDI patients make up 70% of the type 1 diabetes market – this is the opportunity
every player in the sector should be focused on
 
During a recent conference call with investors, President & COO Shacey Petrovic made the following
statement.
 
“We target that the more than 70% of the market that has not adopted pump therapy.”
 
We understand this statement to mean that PODD agrees that approximately 70% of diabetes patients who
use multiple daily injections (“MDI”) to manage their diabetes. On November 15, 2016, a William Blair analyst
also con�rmed in an analyst note that the MDI portion of the sector is 70%. That is an overwhelming segment
within the market. No competitor should be ignoring it.
 
III. Petrovic claims 670G is not focused on MDI patients which represent 70% of the market
 
During another recent conference call with investors, Ms. Petrovic made the following statement.

IV. We spoke with Medtronic to con�rm Ms. Petrovic’s statement was at a minimum “misinformation”
 
There are several topics Ms. Petrovic has discussed in recent PODD earnings calls that can be described as
questionable or misleading – we will leave the rest of her comments out of this discussion for now. We have
chosen to focus this report on just one basic concept that Ms. Petrovic claimed in the paragraph above in a
clear “matter of fact statement.” So, is MDT’s 670G focused on the MDI market?
 
The following quotes are taken from direct discussions we had on December 2, 2016 with a member of the
Medtronic’s diabetes therapy consultant team.
 


 
 
On December 1, 2016 we also spoke with a member of Medtronic’s investor relations team, Tracy McCartney.
We asked the following question. She provided the answer.
 


 
 
V. DXCM and TNDM shares collapsed upon con�rmation of the 670G competitive threat, PODD is due
for an adjustment now as well
 
On November 2, 2016, DXCM and TNDM both admitted the pending 670G launch was impacting their
businesses. Their share prices collapsed 20% and 59% respectively. PODD was unwilling to admit that the
670G is a legitimate competitive threat. We believe the “misinformation” distributed by Ms. Petrovic was the
main reason PODD’s shares have not collapsed in the same manner as DXCM and TNDM shares. With this
example in this report, we believe we have shown Ms. Petrovic’s commentary should be viewed with
skepticism. Given what we know of Mr. Sullivan, the CEO, and Ms. Petrovic now as well, investors really do
need to question every member of this management team. In the meantime, investors should ask why would
Ms. Petrovic decide to say what she said if she wasn't in a desperate position. We think business at PODD is
much worse then the management team is letting on - and/or they can see the next-gen products coming and
realize they have little chance to compete with new technology when their own product which is supposed to
be innovative is actually becoming outdated and old news.
