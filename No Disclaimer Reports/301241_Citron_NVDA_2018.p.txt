Nvidia- The Dog that Finally Caught the Car. 


10 reasons why $NVDA is going to $200 
 


There are about 100 public companies with market caps larger than $100 billion. 
Of these, NVDA is the only stock up more than 200% since the beginning of 
2016. In fact, NVDA is up more than 600% in this period. NVDA is acting as if 
execution risks do not exist. 
 
But they do, and they are never more apparent than right now. When a stock 
sells off while analysts are not budging - you know something is wrong. These 
are the 10 reasons why NVDA is on its way to $200 
 


1. A great valuation that already reflects a great company but ignores risks 
going forward: High multiple stock that is no longer beating and only 
meeting expectations 


 
Since Q1 FY16, NVDA has beat on both revenue and EPS every single quarter 
(i.e., 13 straight quarters).  However, Q2 FY19 revenue beat by less than 1%, 
while EPS only beat by <5%. This is disappointing for a company that is notorious 
for managing the Street’s expectations, and this quarter was by far the smallest 
beat on both metrics in the last 3 years (after beating on revenue and EPS by as 
much as 20% and 70%, respectively, in prior quarters).  
 


2. Victims of their own success: Competition from the most well-funded and 
respected tech companies in the world (e.g., Baidu, Alibaba, Tencent, 
Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Amazon etc.) 


 
Just two weeks ago Tencent led a $50 million round for AI chip maker Suiyuan 
Technologies. This company was founded in March and is just the latest in a long 
list of Chinese AI chip start-ups that capital is being rained on to address a 
problem that is not capital intensive. As we read from Tencent: 
  
“With China’s industrial upgrade, our country should be able to own 
independent and controllable key technologies. AI chip is China’s opportunity to 
catch up in the semiconductor sector," said Leiwen Yao, director at Tencent

Investment. "We hope to leverage our industrial resources and work with 
China’s top teams to change the current situation of foreign AI chip makers’ 
monopolization.” (Source) 


Not only are these tech giants future competitors, but they’re also current 
customers, a cut that could burn twice in the same stroke. 
 


3. A semi-seismic shift in tectonic plates: Already seeing a shift from GPU to 
TPU. 


 
Google’s TPU initiative means the world’s leading AI giant will be relying far less 
on GPU’s, but this is even worse when you consider that other large enterprises 
can avoid spending by renting this hardware. 
  
Just a few months ago, EBAY gave a presentation on how their in-house AI 
hardware -powered by NVDA GPU’s - was used to make EBAY image-recognition 
stronger. 
 
What EBAY used to Present:  


 
 
A few months later, we came across a blog post from an EBAY AI research 
scientist that we expect to start turning heads. In short, EBAY’s AI team found

that using Google’s TPU was significantly faster than using their in-house 
systems, and it also allowed EBAY to avoid large upfront capex. EBAY Case

4. Graphcore!!: if you don’t know it and you own NVDA, it is time to read 
this: https://tinyurl.com/yahdhl6n  
 


When discussing competition, one must mention Graphcore whose name has 
recently been put in every conversation given the strength of their Intelligence 
Processing Unit  
 


5. While NVDA’s Jensen Huang, is a visionary, he is no short of hype: in its 
life span, NVDA has dropped 85% from its highs two times! This has 
largely been attributed to product upgrades not living up to hype, but 
when a mega-cap is up more than 600% in less than 3 years, small hiccups 
can have grave repercussions.  


 
6. Management changing the narrative: Jensen has promoted the crypto 


boom as a key driver of NVDA business over the last year but his optimism 
has quickly reversed

Just one year ago on the Q2 earnings call, CEO Jensen Huang was hyping up 
crypto:  
 
“Cryptocurrency and blockchain is here to stay. The market need for it is going to 
grow, and over time it will become quite large. It is very clear that new 
currencies will come to market, and it's very clear that the GPU is just fantastic 
at cryptography.” (source) 
 
In March this year, Jensen told Cramer in an interview that cryptocurrency was 
an “important driver” for NVDA (source).  
 
When crypto was brought up on NVDA’s call last week the end impression was 
crypto was dead for good and would be “immaterial for the second half.”   
 


7. Autonomous is also not what we thought it was 
 
On Tesla’s latest earnings call, Elon Musk explained that NVDA was no longer 
necessary as their own self-driving chip was more than 10x better: 
 
“It's an incredible job by Pete and his team to create this, the world's most 
advanced computer designed specifically for autonomous operation. And as a 
rough sort of [indiscernible] whereas the current NVIDIA's hardware can do 200 
frames a second, this is able to do over 2,000 frames a second and with full 
redundancy and fail-over.” (Source) 
 


8. The Glaring Problem: Bull case is now predicated on an upgrade cycle 
(can anyone say ‘Turing’) 
 


9. Real Time Ray-Tracing: A term that has been foreign to investors until 
now is the differentiating factor in Turing.  
 


NVDA released its new RTX 2080 chip yesterday. Although the hype was loud, 
the real experts are already voicing some serious concerns. NVDA failed to 
release a single traditional benchmark, leading many to believe the ray-tracing 
technology came at the cost of overall performance. Further, when you 
consider Jensen spent the entire presentation speaking about a single RTX 2080 
feature (ray-tracing), these voices of concern grow clearer and louder.

Quotes from the GeForce Event Mega thread on Reddit: 
 





 
10.  And one of our favorites: short sellers are on the sidelines (short interest 


is at an all-time low) 
 
Anytime NVDA has been hit with potential concerns (e.g., crypto, autonomous 
driving), the immediate analyst fall back is to raise price targets up because of AI 
datacenter.  Despite the inevitable slowdown to the law of large numbers, short 
sellers have become exhausted in the name and that is usually a good time to 
get involved as short interest is at an all-time low - GREAT NEWS.

We see many parallels with NFLX. When NFLX optimism was at its peak, we 
were seeing changes in the media industry that could not be ignored by any 
long-term investor. NFLX was trading around $390 when Citron said the stock 
would pull back to $340 or lower. As of today, NFLX is down almost 20% at 
~$329.

Conclusion  
 
Citron made a promise to donate $230k to the Humane Society if NVDA closes 
the year above $230 in April.  As much as NVDA is one cute dog….this is the dog 
that finally caught the car.  We will donate $100k when $NVDA closes below 200 
in April. 
 


 
 
NVDA remains a victim of its own success with competition mounting from 
every side. Execution risks are many, and, at peak multiples, NVDA’s margin for 
error is next to nothing.
