Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life­Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price
Target $15


Highlights


PODD enjoys an unexplained premium, we see 42% downside before considering any of the following
issues with its sole product, the Omnipod insulin pump


Irrefutable evidence of 44 Omnipod patient deaths, FDA-acknowledged under-reporting factor suggests
patient deaths could be as high as 4,400


Numerous allegations by a whistleblower: patient death cover-up, undisclosed settlement


Multiple third parties and parents of diabetic children warn about Omnipod - “life-threatening,
especially for children”


PODD recently con�rmed approximately 28,000 children (30% of patient base) use the Omnipod


Omnipod product defects clearly exist and have not been resolved 5 years later


Post-recalls and design modi�cation, PODD’s FDA adverse events have climbed rather than decline
both in total and for the needle defect


Risks associated with 20-month old FDA investigation ignored by sell-side analysts, we con�rmed
investigation remains open


Competition is heating up, new innovative products from Medtronic and J&J arriving by end of ’16


Serious fraud allegations – we see signs and evidence that current and prior management have
deceived patients, investors and perhaps the FDA

I. Introduction to PODD
 
We began our research of Insulet Corporation (“PODD”) in August 2016. We were intrigued by PODD’s
seemingly extreme valuation as well as serious allegations of fraud that had been made against PODD’s prior
management. These attributes of a public company will always peak our interest. However, soon after we
began our research we uncovered a large number of patient deaths involving PODD’s sole product, the
Omnipod, as well as allegations and evidence of the Omnipod being "life-threatening" to children. We’ve now
spent almost three months on this report. However, PODD struck a cord with us. We do not believe PODD
management have the best interests of its patients in mind. PODD’s patient base includes a large number of
children. The current situation is just absolutely unacceptable.

7/5/2019 Skytides - Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life-Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price Target $15


skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 2/38


 
The following is an expanded summary of the bullet points presented above.
 
1. We see the market’s valuation of PODD stock to be “extreme.” This is a premium pricing of a company that
even prior to this report is unexplained. Subsequent to this report, we believe a discount rather than a
premium is warranted, for the reasons outlined below. See Section II of this report for additional discussion of
this topic.
 
2. Patient deaths are serious business for any medical technology or biotech company. The lack of disclosure
of the full details of PODD’s patient deaths to investors, patients and the government is beyond
reprehensible. In this report we present a total of 44 patient deaths associated with PODD patients that were
included in an FDA database of 8,236 adverse event reports (“FDA Reports”) associated with PODD. We feel
strongly that of the research we obtained, the 4 patient deaths listed below are likely due to the Omnipod to
some degree. A summary excerpt of our research of these 4 deaths is as follows. We urge all readers to
review these FDA Reports by clicking on the links referenced below this image.
 


 
        Patient death #1: 4270189
        Patient death #2: 3495620
        Patient death #3: 3644443
        Patient death #4: 5381402
 
These are just 4 of the 44 patient deaths we obtained evidence about. We note that the true number of
Omnipod patient deaths is understated due to an under-reporting phenomenon associated with the FDA
Report database that the FDA itself has con�rmed exists. When the under-reporting is considered, the true
number of undisclosed Omnipod patient deaths could be as high as 4,400.
 
A few excerpts from this report related to this topic are as follows:
 
- “The patient’s nurse/trainer reported that the patient was dead and her family is very unhappy. They said
the pump had never worked but that this was due to the pods continually falling o�.”
- “…His pt was receiving erroneously low readings using the Omnipod…She stated the date of death and that
the deceased was found wearing a pod.”
- “The medical examiner’s o�ce called on (B)(6) 2011 to report that a customer was found deceased in his
home. He was found wearing a POD and a Dexcom CGM.”
- “The police was then called and upon their arrival at his house he was found dead in a chair in the living
room. The POD was found beeping; it was teared o� the body and laid next to the corpse.”
 
See Section IV of this report for additional discussion of this topic.
 
3. We obtained evidence of the involvement of a whistleblower who alleged that patient death #1 was due to
the Omnipod and that there was a subsequent cover-up of the patient death. It appears he or she was then
paid o�.
 
A few excerpts from this report related to this topic are as follows:
 
- “The hospital did however download partial data showing the pump failure just prior to her death.”

skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 3/38


- “It is more probable than not that the device caused or contributed to her death.”
- “I was made aware of the incident by XX also of Ypsomed who stated that XX never reported it (buried it)”
- “I exposed it shortly after �nding out and have since accepted a settlement.” We are entirely unsure why
anyone would be paid a settlement in connection with a patient’s death.
- “The event was covered up on many levels for which I hold evidence.” We note the death was not reported
until two (2) years after the death.
 
See Section IV of this report for additional discussion of this topic.
 
4. We obtained evidence and allegations by multiple third parties that the Omnipod is "life-threatening" to
children. A few excerpts from this report are as follows:
 
- “Omnipod is life-threatening, especially for children.”
- “…blood glucose would be a very high number damaging her eyes, kidneys, veins, heart…everyone of these
issues is life-threatening and could result in death”
- “…(by this time I have no faith whatsoever that my child is getting insulin.)…even if it was delivering basal
insulin, the pod was not able to deliver insulin boluses which keep a child alive when they eat any food with
carbohydrates.”
- “I am so afraid that a child or someone who is unaware of the issue will go on a �ight and have a very
serious hypoglycemic event.”
PODD’s President and Chief Commercial O�cer recently con�rmed 30% of PODD’s patient base are children.
We calculate a total of approximately 28,000 children now use the “life-threatening” Omnipod and are at risk
every day.
 
See Section V of this report for additional discussion of this topic.
 
5. PODD has one severe defect it has been dealing with for 5 years and has yet to resolve it. Another product
defect with its PDM appears as though it too soon could cause another recall. A few excerpts from this report
are as follows:
 
- “In sum, the accusation that we had needle �ring issues is absolutely true.”
- “… The customer's mother reported that the needle deployed 10 minutes after it was supposed to.”
- “Insulet's almost disinterested response is a reason to doubt that they will diagnose the cause of these
malfunctions. Their focus is "how soon would you like to receive replacement pots?" despite it being clear that
replacement pods are a bad idea now.”
- “One Insulet employee that she knew actually stopped using the Eros altogether because they did not trust
the product.”
 
See Section VI of this report for additional discussion of this topic.
 
Sections VII, VIII, IX and X outline additional research involving the continued increase in adverse events PODD
patients have reported, PODD’s regulatory risk, the competitive landscape and fraud allegations against
management, respectively. Section XI discusses the future of PODD and our considerations related to its
valuation.
 
II. PODD stock currently enjoys an unexplained 42% premium prior to considering the �ndings we
outline in this report
 
We reviewed a New York University ongoing study (the “NYU Study”) to obtain third party data on medical
device sector valuation multiples. We then utilized the data in the NYU Study to consider the market’s
valuation of PODD shares. Our analysis is presented in the following chart.

skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 4/38


 
We see no valid reason why PODD should be given a premium valuation within its sector. We provide a
detailed discussion of PODD’s valuation within the last section of this report, entitled “Ticking Time-bomb.”
 
III. A Brief Overview of PODD’s sole product – the Omnipod
 
PODD’s sole product is the Omnipod, as seen in the image below. The Omnipod system includes a patch-like
device that is meant to adhere to the skin of a diabetes patient and deliver insulin into the patient’s
bloodstream using a very thin needle, known as a “cannula.” The Omnipod personal diabetes manager
(“PDM”) is a wireless smartphone-like device the diabetes patient uses to control the Omnipod. At the end of
each 3-day period the Omnipod is disposed of by the patient and a new Omnipod is meant to be adhered to
their skin.

The Omnipod system is described in additional detail at PODD’s website.
 
While researching the Omnipod device we reviewed the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s (“FDA”)
manufacturer and user facility device experience database (“MAUDE”) to obtain every adverse event report
(“FDA Report”) associated with the Omnipod. We uncovered a variety of quantitative and qualitative content

within a total of 8,236 FDA Reports which led us to conduct additional diligence to understand Omnipod
malfunctions and injuries associated with children, Omnipod patient deaths, and speci�c FDA Report data
and data trends. We will detail the various �ndings throughout this report.
 
IV. We uncovered FDA data suggesting 39 patient deaths could be tied to the Omnipod, we feel
strongly that 4 of the patient deaths are tied to the Omnipod, another 35 patient deaths may also be
connected
 
We uncovered a variety of content within the FDA Reports which led us to conduct additional diligence to
understand Omnipod patient deaths. We found a total of 44 patient deaths. We provide our detailed �ndings
below.
 
Red: 4 patient deaths that we feel strongly are tied to the Omnipod
Yellow: 35 patient deaths may also be connected

skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 6/38


 
 
1. We uncovered speci�c direct allegations by a whistleblower that a PODD patient died as a result of the
Omnipod, that the whistleblower was paid-o� and that there was a cover-up associated with this patient
death. In this FDA Report PODD seems to e�ectively conclude the Omnipod device may be to blame yet
PODD has not publicly acknowledged its Omnipod has caused any patient deaths. The relevant quotes in the
FDA Report are as follows:
 
“The hospital did however download partial data showing the pump failure just prior to her death.”
 
“It is more probable than not that the device caused or contributed to her death.”
 
“I was made aware of the incident by XX also of Ypsomed who stated that XX never reported it (buried
it)”

“I exposed it shortly after �nding out and have since accepted a settlement.”
 
“The event was covered up on many levels for which I hold evidence.”
 
These quotes are highlighted in the image below.
 


 
Source
 
We noted through review of the FDA Report that PODD appears to have con�rmed the Omnipod patient
death subsequent to “multiple failures of the pump prior to her death.” A whistleblower �led an additional
report with the FDA to allege the cover-up of the patient death and the settlement and pay-o� of the
whistleblower.
 
Questions all shareholders should be asking:
 
- Why is a settlement and pay-o� associated with a patient death?
- What were the terms of this settlement?
- How often, why and to what dollar value annually has PODD entered into settlements with patients,
whistleblowers and others?
- Why did PODD determine it did not need to disclose this patient death within its �lings with the SEC?
- Why did PODD wait 2 full years before �ling this FDA Report with the FDA?

2. We uncovered an FDA Report apparently �led by PODD that suggested a “device problem” was associated
with a patient death. The relevant content is highlighted in the image below.
 
“The patient’s nurse/trainer reported that the patient was dead and her family is very unhappy. They
said the pump had never worked but that this was due to the pods continually falling o�.”
 


 
Source
 
Questions all shareholders should be asking:
 
- According to this FDA Report, the Omnipod devices were “continually falling o�” of the patient causing her
BG levels to go high which caused her to then try “correcting with an insulin pen.” The issues all started with
the Omnipod not working and “continually falling o�” of the patient. How could this be construed as anything
other than a patient death due to an Omnipod device failure?
- Why did PODD determine it did not need to disclose this patient death within its �lings with the SEC?
 
3. We uncovered an FDA Report apparently �led by PODD that suggested a “device problem” was associated
with a patient death.  The relevant content is highlighted in the image below.
 
“…His pt was receiving erroneously low readings using the Omnipod…She stated the date of death and
that the deceased was found wearing a pod.”
 


 
Source
 
Questions every shareholder should be asking:
 
- According to this FDA Report, the Omnipod PDM device was providing “erroneously low readings” of the
patient’s insulin levels. PODD attempts to suggest that Abbott is blame for faulty test strips but then a
physician tested the strips and determined they were providing readings “within range.” How could this be
construed as anything other than a patient death due to an Omnipod device failure?
- Why did PODD determine it did not need to disclose this patient death within its �lings with the SEC?

4. We uncovered an FDA Report apparently �led by PODD that suggested a “device problem” was associated
with a patient death.  The relevant content is highlighted in the image below.
 


 
Source
 
Questions every shareholder should be asking:
 
- According to this FDA Report, the patient death involved a device problem termed “failure to deploy.” We
understand that “failure to deploy” refers to the failure of the Omnipod to deploy its needle which is designed
to be inserted into the patient to deliver insulin. As such this could have been a contributing or the sole factor
in the patient’s death. We note that the remainder of the FDA Report seems to contradict this statement
entirely and seems to blame the patient rather than the device. So what is the truth? It is not clear in this FDA
Report what actually happened.
- Why did PODD determine it did not need to disclose this patient death within its �lings with the SEC?
 
5. 35 Additional Patient Deaths Possibly Tied to Omnipod
 
We reviewed every Omnipod patient death that has been reported to the FDA and included within the
MAUDE database through October 31, 2016 (reported as of November 6, 2016). We paid particular attention
to the “event description” for each patient death to determine (1) if a third party had determined the cause of
the death of the patient and (2) if the patient death possibly related to the use of the Omnipod. It is clear to us



http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfMAUDE/Detail.CFM?MDRFOI__ID=5381402
7/5/2019 Skytides - Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life-Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price Target $15


skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 10/38


that PODD does not know or does not wish to disclose the cause of the patient death in many cases. A total of
43% of the reports we reviewed provided clear evidence that either (1) PODD did not obtain a speci�c cause
of death from a third party or (2) perhaps they have decided not to disclose the cause of death to the FDA. We
further concluded that 89% of the reports we reviewed showed no evidence that the patient death was not
tied to the use of the Omnipod.
 
Various questions arise:
 
- Why have the needle mechanism failures continued for the last 5 years and why can’t PODD resolve this
defect?
- Why have the PDM failures continued for several years now and why can’t PODD resolve this defect?
 
We are providing a few examples of the commentary included in some of these other FDA Reports to display
the questionable circumstances associated with many of these deaths and PODD’s apparent lack of follow-up
to obtain a cause of death.
 
2149043 “He was missing for one week before being found in a lake near his home. Though the cause of his
passing was not conclusive at the time of the report, it was due to "either hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia.
“The customer had been using the Omnipod system at the time of the event.”
 
2287936 “The medical examiner’s o�ce called on (B)(6) 2011 to report that a customer was found deceased in
his home. He was found wearing a POD and a Dexcom CGM.”
 
4577978 “The police was then called and upon their arrival at his house he was found dead in a chair in the
living room. The POD was found beeping; it was teared o� the body and laid next to the corpse.”
 
5698742 “A medical examiner called to report the death of a patient wearing the Omnipod. The cause of the
death was identi�ed as hypertensive heart disease. The medical examiner requested the POD be
evaluated to rile out a malfunction of the device.”
 
5848241 “The patient’s wife reported that she woke up and noticed that her husband was not breathing so
she called 911. Upon their arrival they told her that he had passed away before they got there. She also
reported the night before he was sweating really badly so she checked his blood glucose and it read 145
MG/DL. She stated that she wanted to take him to the doctor but he told her “no” and that he was �ne. There
was no report of speci�c device malfunction however, we cannot rule out any allegation of device
involvement at this time. Pending further investigation.”
 
- What is the latest on these patient deaths?
- Were they device related?
- It appears to us that although “updates” were promised that once a patient death occurs and if an FDA
Report is �led that no follow-up is generally provided to the FDA. Investors and patients are routinely kept in
the dark about Omnipod patient deaths. Further, why would a medical device manufacturer such as PODD
deserve a premium valuation with these questions being unanswered?
 
6.     FDA underreporting – this data infers actual Omnipod patient deaths are well in excess of 44
 
The data in the patient death chart included in Section I represents all Omnipod patient deaths reported to
the FDA as of November 6, 2016. However, the FDA, a former FDA commissioner and a Harvard Medical
School professor stated that actual adverse events, including patient deaths, are under-reported by a factor
of 100, 20 or 10 (“FDA Under-reporting Factor”). Therefore, this chart should not be considered a complete list
of all patient deaths involving the Omnipod and should only be considered to be a sample of Omnipod
patient deaths. As seen in the chart we developed below, actual Omnipod patient deaths could be as low as
440 and as high as 4,400 if we rely on the FDA Under-reporting Factor.

V. “Life‐threatening” Omnipod puts 28,000 children at risk every day
 
On November 3, 2016, PODD’s President and Chief Commerical Officer, Shacey Petrovic, stated that 30% of
PODD’s patient base consisted of pediatric patients (i.e. children). We considered Ms. Petrovic’s statement along
with other evidence we obtained from a recent sell‐side analyst report to calculate an approximate number of
children who used the Omnipod as of June 30, 2016. We estimated approximately 28,002 children used the
Omnipod as of June 30, 2016. See the calculation in Exhibit 2.
 
We noted an FDA Report, #3695503, that explained some alarming issues with the use of an Omnipod by a child.
 
“…a false low reading, for example the PDM reads 65 when the blood glucose is actually 165, would result in me
giving my child 30 carbohydrates with no insulin. After which her blood glucose would be a very high number
damaging her eyes, kidneys, veins, heart. This is damaging to every part of her body…We have also had
many pod failures…I have spoken with many others having the same problems we are… I do not believe the
new system was ready for being put on the market. It has many issues that need to be addressed. Everyone
of these issues is life‐threatening and could result in death...”
 
We reviewed a lawsuit alleging securities fraud against PODD that remains pending today. On June 1, 2016, an
amended complaint was filed by the plaintiffs that included some extraordinary statements by various witnesses.
One witness, a professional device trainer, stated the following:
 
“The product defect aspects of the pod were “life threatening, especially for children.”
 
Source: See Exhibit 3, Arkansas Teacher Retirement System v. Insulet, et al., 1:15‐cv‐12345
 
We have included excerpts from 51 separate Omnipod FDA Reports associated with children in Exhibit 4. Each of
these excerpts displays the unnecessary harm these children are enduring.
 
VI. Product defects
 
1. Needle mechanism failures
 
The photo below displays the internal design of the Omnipod. The blue needle protrudes to the right side of the
device in this photograph. This needle, also known as the cannula, has been at the center of PODD’s problems
with adverse events, patient deaths and ongoing daily risks to children, among others, since 2011. A total of
6,223 FDA Reports reference the Omnipod “needle” or “cannula” thus far. The FDA Reports are increasing rather
than decreasing upon management’s efforts to correct the product defect. We don’t believe the needle

mechanism failures have been resolved in the last 5 years that PODD has been aware of it and we see no reason
why an investor should expect PODD can resolve it in the next 5 years.

The FDA Reports included details about the Cannula failing in a number of ways, as outlined below:
 
1. Failing to deploy (Needle/cannula remains inside the Omnipod)
2. Failing to insert itself into the body as designed
3. Failing to remain inserted within the patient’s body
4. Becoming bent and therefore unable to deliver insulin into the patient’s body
5. Becoming kinked (Cannula is somehow misshapen into a sharp twist or curve) and therefore unable to deliver
insulin into the patient’s body
6. Failing to retract itself back into the Omnipod device
 
A visual example of Omnipod cannula (i.e. blue needle) failures due to bending and kinking:

Additional evidence of needle failures is provided in Exhibit 5.
 
A few excerpts from the FDA Reports involving children and the needle mechanism failures are included below.
More complete excerpts and links to the source of each excerpt are included in Exhibit 4. Remember, each of
these excerpts, many of which represent notes written up by PODD employees, refer to the patients as
“customers” but they actually appear to be children.
 
3760958 “The customer's parent reported on (b)(6) their (b)(6) autistic son was hospitalized…he was vomiting so
they called his doctor who advised them to take him to the emergency room…The pod was removed, they then
noticed the cannula was folded over and it was totally dried…”
 
3603244 “Many of the failures occurred in less than 48 hours of use, with some occurring after as little as three
hours of use. Approx. 76 of the pods have worked normally, resulting in a 28% failure rate (29/105 total pods to
date).”
 
4189290 “… The customer's mother reported that the needle deployed 10 minutes after it was supposed to.”
 
5207721 “Our son has an Omnipod insulin pump. He has had 3 pods that failed to deploy the needle and insert,
but when deactivated and taken off and set down with a little jolt all three deployed after removal…”
 
4838212 “…ever since Omnipod moved to the smaller insulin pod extra insulin has been being released from the
pod during flights. I was unaware this was happening. my doctor at the time was also unaware. I have now
resorted to literally removing the Omnipod on flights…I am so afraid that a child or someone who is unaware of
the issue will go on a flight and have a very serious hypoglycemic event.”
 
2. PDM providing inaccurate blood glucose readings
 
4055921 “…for comparative purposes, if the battery on the Medtronic pump dies, it has memory and retains all
previous information including bolus history…it will continuously alarm. Thus the pod has no connection with the
PDM knowing which pod is active at the time…leads me to question the safety because it seems like the PDM has

7/5/2019 Skytides - Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life-Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price Target $15

no memory of the "messages" or signals it's sending to the pod and how much insulin the pod has delivered. It
just loses communication with the pod that is on the child's body…they noted that the PDM is supposed to be
able to work within 5 feet of the pod (on the body); however, this one barely worked when it was within even 5
inches of the pod…(by this time I have no faith whatsoever that my child is getting insulin.)…even if it was
delivering basal insulin, the pod was not able to deliver insulin boluses which keep a child alive when they
eat any food with carbohydrates.”
 
5134737 “The patient's mother reported her daughter had to go to the emergency room and that she had
been in two comas as results. The doctor believe that there is something wrong with the PDM as the
patient's blood glucose keep going from low to high…”
 
4527412 “The patient's mother reported while sitting in the back seat of the car her daughter's blood glucose
result was 60 mg/dl and that she was having a seizure so she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. At
the hospital a BG meter comparison was performed. Her PDM read 223 mg/dl vs 481 mg/dl for the hospital's
meter. She stayed in the hospital for a week before being released…”
 
VII. PODD’s FDA adverse events are rising, the last time an analyst brought these up PODD’ stock dropped
4.5%
 
The chart below displays the continued increase in adverse events that users of the Omnipod are encountering.
The last time a PODD analyst brought this topic up PODD’s stock dropped 4.5%. We note that adverse events
were much lower than they are nowadays.

VIII. Regulatory risk in PODD shares is “high” if not “sky‐high” – absolutely appalling to us that analysts did
not ask PODD management for an update on the FDA investigation during Q2, Q3 earnings calls
 
On June 11, 2015, Raj Denhoy, an analyst at Jefferies, stated:
 
"The FDA warning letter announced today doesn’t appear material but the observations behind the letter,
namely manufacturing and quality deficiencies, provide a window into the issues that have hammered the
company’s recent results. We believe this issue will ultimately prove temporary and rate shares Buy."
 
It is now 17 months later. It is safe to say Mr. Denhoy’s view was quite far off. Since his statement, PODD has
issued 4 recalls, the FDA has spent almost a full month inspecting PODD’s headquarters on different occasions –
that we know of, and as recently as July 29, 2016, PODD confirmed that the FDA investigation into its needle
mechanism failure has not been closed.
 
However, during this same time period, the market seems to have ignored the regulatory risk in PODD stock and
perhaps accepted Mr. Denhoy’s view. This is inexplicable and can not be expected to continue. Simply put, an
FDA investigation into any company’s products, namely a company that has just one project such as PODD, is a
serious risk. Yet during PODD’s earnings calls on August 3, 2016 and November 3, 2016, respectively, the analysts
covering PODD did not ask whether the FDA investigation was closed or not. This is appalling to us. There is no
doubt in our minds that the FDA investigation which has now been open for 20 months (i.e. Since March 2015) is
serious and perhaps “company threatening.” We can’t fathom why the analysts did not have this topic at the top
of their list – though we acknowledge they don’t get paid to find negative information on the companies they
cover. They also did not ask about Johnson & Johnson’s (“JNJ”) new insulin pump as well – as we explain further
below in this report.
 
We have reviewed all 4 of PODD’s FDA recalls since July 2015 and 8,236 FDA Reports submitted to MAUDE by
PODD and others involving the Omnipod. Our review of the FDA Reports noted various ways in which the needle,
also referred to as the Cannula, could fail. The first FDA Report involving a needle mechanism failure involved an
event that occurred on July 11, 2011. Including that initial report, we have identified 6,223 additional FDA
Reports that referenced “needle” or “cannula” failures. Therefore, the needle mechanism failure is the most
common adverse event, 75.6% (i.e. 6,223/8,236) experienced by PODD’s patients. It is clearly the most
important issue PODD faces. The most recent FDA Report involving the cannula relates to an incident that
occurred on October 4, 2016. The FDA Report was filed with the FDA on October 31, 2016. FDA Reports for PODD
appear to be generally submitted approximately 30 days after the event date. FDA Reports since October 31,
2016 do not appear available yet in the MAUDE database (as of November 11, 2016). We believe this data we
have collected represents clear and compelling evidence that the Omnipod needle mechanism failures have
continued over a 5+ year time span.
 
Below is a chart we developed to visualize the regulatory timeline associated with the needle mechanism
failure. We have noted the following specific dates as key dates within this timeline.
 
A.   March 11‐27, 2015 – FDA surprise field visit at PODD’s headquarters in Billerica, MA “resulted in four
inspectional observations”
B.    June 5, 2015 – FDA warning letter
C.    July 13, 2015 – FDA Class 1 recall (risk of death)
D.   July 13, 2015 – FDA Class 1 recall (risk of death)
E.    November 12, 2015 – FDA Class 1 expanded recall (risk of death)
F.    November 12, 2015 – FDA Class 1 expanded recall (risk of death)
G.   November 30, 2015 – December 12, 2015 – FDA surprise field visit at PODD’s headquarters in Billerica, MA
“also resulted in four inspectional observations”
H.   April 26, 2016 – FDA 510(K) approval of needle mechanism design modification
I.      April 28, 2016 – on or before this date PODD requested FDA provide “closure” on the FDA investigation
J.     July 29, 2016 – PODD confirms to SEC that FDA has still not closed the FDA investigation

7/5/2019 Skytides - Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life-Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price Target $15


skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 16/38


K.   August 3, 2016 – PODD’s CEO Mr. Sullivan spoke of an expected additional FDA inspection but gave no
timeline "in of time for the FDA inspection of the facility as well as the quality system"
 
 


 
 
The lack of discussion of the status of the FDA investigation is yet another example of lack of followup and lack
of transparency by PODD management. On the April 28, 2016 conference call, Mr. Sullivan explains that PODD
completed all activities related to the recall. Which recall is he referring to? We also question whether this is
misleading or not as the adverse events related to the needle mechanism failures (for which the recalls were
issued) have continued and even increased since he made this statement in April 2016.
 
“During the first quarter, we made solid progress in resolving the quality and regulatory issues we
encountered in the second half of 2015. We completed all activities related to the recall and Field Safety
Notification, and we requested closure from the FDA. Our new QA and R18 did a great job in resolving these
issues effectively. Our operations team also made great progress in improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of our supply chain and manufacturing operations.”
 
In his statement on April 28, 2016, Mr. Sullivan explains that PODD “requested closure from the FDA.” However,
a letter from Insulet to the SEC dated July 29, 2016 confirmed PODD still had not received “closure from the
FDA.

7/5/2019 Skytides - Insulet: Undisclosed Patient Deaths “Life-Threatening, Especially for Children,” Price Target $15


skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 17/38


 
It is now 20 months since the FDA investigation began in March 2105 and at least 6 months since PODD requested
closure from the FDA. Why hasn’t the FDA granted PODD closure? Has PODD fully informed the public about their
current status with their regulator, the FDA? This leads us to believe (1) that the issues the FDA is investigating
are serious and have not been resolved by PODD, (2) PODD management not be providing a fully transparent view
of the FDA investigation to its shareholders and (3) PODD’s regulatory risk is “high” – if not “sky high.”
 
When we reviewed PODD’s August 3, 2016 earnings call transcript we came across an interesting statement Mr.
Sullivan made as seen below.
 


 
We contacted PODD’s investor relations team on November 11, 2016 to obtain clarity on this issue. We were told
the FDA inspection Mr. Sullivan is referring to in the above quote is “normal” and “recurring” but PODD has
been given no timetable for the next FDA inspection. We find it hard to believe that the FDA has “closed the
book” on PODD given the recent regulatory history and increasing adverse event reports.
 
The amount of FDA activity associated with PODD thus far has been significant. The FDA investigation opened in
March 2015 does not appear to have been closed as of the date of this report. We see all of these factors as
evidence that PODD stock should be priced at a significant discount from its current price due to the “high” and
perhaps “sky high” regulatory risk associated with its sole product, the Omnipod.
 
Several questions arise:
 
‐ Have any FDA inspections occurred in 2016 thus far?
‐ If so, what was the result of these FDA inspections?
‐ Are any FDA inspections expected between now and yearend?
‐ Why hasn’t the FDA closed their investigation?
‐ Should investors be concerned what the FDA’s next step will be given the lack of progress PODD has made (i.e.
adverse events involving the needle mechanism failures are continuing) with regard to resolving needle
mechanism failures?
‐ What happens if the FDA pulls the Omnipod from the market?

‐ Could the FDA pull the Omnipod from the pediatric market?
 
IX. Competition: PODD innovation at frog’s pace, Medtronic leaped ahead with the 670G and both PODD and
analysts avoid discussion of JNJ’s new patch product
 
PODD is developing an artificial pancreas device that management currently expects to launch in “late 2018,
2019.” That is three years away and two years late in order to compete with two new competitive insulin pumps
that should both begin impacting PODD’s business prospects in late 2016. Needless to say, PODD shows no sign of
attempting to lead innovation within their sector.
 
1. Medtronic
 
In September 2016, Medtronic, PLC (“MDT”) further solidified its leadership position in the diabetes field when
the FDA approved the 670G insulin pump. Recently, PODD’s stock came under pressure recently due to its
competitor Tandem Diabetes Care, Inc. (“TNDM”). TNDM reported poor results on November 1, 2016 and
admitted their business was feeling competitive pressure from MDT. PODD’s stock reacted to this news and
dropped sharply but then rebounded after its November 3, 2016 earnings call, when PODD management,
specifically Ms. Petrovic, suggested that business was not being impacted by the pending launch of the 670G
insulin pump.  It was suggested that this was because of PODD’s focus on the pediatric patient base – which we
understand to represent 30% of PODD’s patient base. This explanation perhaps covers 30% of the patient base
(i.e. children) but does not explain PODD’s competitive landscape with regard to the other 70% of their patient
base. We believe management was simply unwilling to admit the 670G was impacting the business. We expect
this issue will come up again in future calls and investor interactions. We don’t expect the “pediatric focus” to
continue to be an acceptable response to this question. We expect the 670G will be competitive with 70% of
PODD’s patient base and Q4 2016 will be when PODD finally admits the real impact the 670G is or will have on
PODD. As a result, we see PODD shares getting “Tandemed” soon on the issues we outline in this report or at the
latest when PODD reports its 2016 annual results.
 
We believe the image of the 670G below provides all the investor needs to know when they consider MDT’s
competitive position as compared to PODD. The image depicts a device that does utilize a tube (tubeless design
is considered the Omnipod’s key selling point) but it is hardly a dramatic or more cumbersome device than the
Omnipod. The image below is of the MDT 670G. Is the tube really a significant enough drawback of MDT and
other devices, i.e. the tube that connects the infusion site to the insulin pump, to warrant choosing the Omnipod
over the Minimed?

2.    Johnson & Johnson
 
During PODD’s November 3, 2016 earnings call, JNJ’s highly anticipated insulin pump, the OneTouch Via, was not
brought up by either PODD or its analysts. The OneTouch Via is a thin 3‐day “meal‐time” insulin patch.

skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 20/38


Source
 
For years now PODD has faced off with MDT and has gained little marketshare, if any, from MDT. If this article is
correct, JNJ will launch the OneTouch Via in 2016 and PODD will then be facing not one but two international
medtech leaders with an Omnipod device that has at least two serious long‐term unresolved product defects
associated with it, may be causing or partially causing patient deaths, and is at risk of the FDA pulling the device
from the market or perhaps the pedriatic segment – which represents 30% of PODD’s patientbase.
 
Lastly, we have seen no evidence of innovation from PODD since the second generation Omnipod was cleared by
the FDA in December 2012. We found evidence that as of June 2016 PODD’s internal research and development
team is down to a “skeleton staff.” We question whether the development of the artificial pancreas is a priority
for PODD. We suggest management clarify who is developing their new product. Is it all being outsourced? Is it
really feasible to do that and still be successful? Insulet is/was seen as an innovation leader in this space. If this
development is being outsourced, who are the innovators that have been hired?
 
X. Fraud allegations against previous management, signs current management has not changed the culture
at PODD
 
The currently pending securities fraud lawsuit includes some serious claims and evidence against prior
management of PODD. This lawsuit, Arkansas Teacher Retirement System v. Insulet, et al., 1:15‐cv‐12345,
includes the following allegations, which are also provided in Exhibit 5.
 
“By the second and third quarters of 2012, Insulet released product that it knew had an outgoing quality
level of as low as 68%. Such product would include both “Severity‐A” failures such as the needle mechanism
failure and the leaking pod problems…”
 
“In sum, the accusation that we had needle firing issues is absolutely true.”

skytides.com/article/insulet-undisclosed-patient-deaths-“life-threatening-especially-children”-price-target-15 21/38


“The Omnipod Eros suffered from a software defect that caused “unnecessary alarms for occlusion, which
indicated that the pump was occluded when in fact it was not…nonetheless, despite known high defect
rates, in the end Insulet’s decision was always made to ship the product because getting product shipments
out the door was critical to Insulet’s survival.”
 
“One Insulet employee that she knew actually stopped using the Eros altogether because they did not trust
the product.”
 
Mr. Sullivan was hired as the CEO of PODD on September 16, 2014. The following comments by current and
former employees were made in the past two years since he was hired. It seems the culture with Mr. Sullivan at
the helm may not be much different than when Mr. Desisto, PODD previous CEO, was at the helm.
 
1. Product failure and adverse event cover‐up allegations
 
Jan 21, 2015: A former employee stated “The product has a 5% out‐of‐box failure rate and their solution is to
send a new box to anyone who complains, cover up the complaint…the product is made in China so all defects
can be handled locally without "Federal" knowledge. Distribute the defects evenly so there's an average 5%
failure rate and nobody's the wiser. Play along and you'll get a nice bonus. Don't play and get "laid off…the
senior management is either playing the game or being paid to keep quiet.”
 
One FDA Report we reviewed referenced this “adverse event cover‐up scheme” as follows:
 
“Insulet's almost disinterested response is a reason to doubt that they will diagnose the cause of these
malfunctions. Their focus is "how soon would you like to receive replacement pots?" despite it being clear
that replacement pods are a bad idea now.”
 
2. Allegations of forced cooperation of employees in cover‐up – cover up of what?
 
May 10, 2016: A current employee stated “Middle management hides everything.”
 
May 2, 2016: A current employee stated “…brought people over who they know they can trust to fall in line
and not question anything and for CYA. No morals; no values;…EVERYBODY is afraid to speak up even as they
see the iceberg ahead. No diversity (especially absent is cognitive diversity). If you speak up or question,
you're gone.
 
We also reference our notes above about FDA closure not being obtained – apparently, and PODD’s regulatory
status not being communicated to shareholders.
 
3. Refusal to respond to the recent market discussion about cyber‐security breaches of medical devices
On October 4, 2016, JNJ confirmed that its insulin pumps were vunerable to cyber hacking. This is not a complex
topic. These devices are either designed to protect against cyber hacking or they are not. We believe PODD
knows the answer to this question but has refused to inform its patients and the public due to the potential
negative impact this news could have on its stock. Of course we are just hypothesizing but why, almost two
weeks later, has PODD not responded and informed its patient of a possible cyber hacking risk – which by
definition would be life‐threatening for its patients?
 
XI. Ticking Time‐bomb
 
We view PODD as a ticking time‐bomb of a stock. Catalysts include but are not limited to the following:
 
‐ If a patient death linked to the Omnipod is disclosed (by PODD or a third party) to the public
‐ If a child dies or even almost dies as a result of the Omnipod
‐ PODD admitting it is feeling the competitive pressure of Medtronic releasing its 670G artificial pancreas device

‐ PODD admitting it is feeling the competitive pressure of J&J releasing the OneTouch Via insulin pump or any of
the other 7 AP competitors we identified
‐ If the FDA pulls the product from the market when the FDA completes its next surprise inspection of PODD’s
office
‐ If the FDA recognizes the harm the Omnipod is causing to children and revokes PODD’s ability to accept
patients under 14 years of age – which represents 30% of PODD’s patient base
‐ If adverse events related to the needle mechanism failure continue to rise
‐ If adverse events related to PDM failures product defects rise
‐ If patient deaths rise?
‐ If PODD fails to keep up with the market and is unable to develop an artificial pancreas on schedule by 2019
‐ If PODD’s AP is based to some extent on PODD’s Omnipod platform, which continues to experience ongoing
failures, what makes PODD believe its AP product will not exhibit the same failures?
 
We see total downside risk in PODD shares of 59% and a target price of $15. Our valuation model is as follows.

* We obtained a copy of a BTIG August 3, 2016 research report that stated PODD’s U.S. and International
“ending installed base” for June 2016 totaled 62,201 and 31,140 respectively. Therefore, the total “ending
installed base” for June 2016 was 93,341 patients. We have presumed BTIG utilizes accurate �nancial and
patient information provided by PODD management.
 
Exhibit 3
 


 
Exhibit 4
 
3695503 Since we switched to the new omnipod system with smaller pods, we have had many issues. the
most recent being recalled test strips in conjunction with the omnipod personal diabetes manager (pdm). the
strips which were recalled still worked properly with the freestyle freedom meter, meaning the issue (blood
glucose reading showing much lower than what was accurate) was the pdm and the strips being used
together. a lower blood glucose reading results in more carbohydrates and less insulin or no insulin being
given. a false low reading, for example the pdm reads 65 when the blood glucose is actually 165, would result
in me giving my child 30 carbohydrates with no insulin. after which her blood glucose would be a very high
number damaging her eyes, kidneys, veins, heart. I have received the replacement strips from Abbott and still
the issue continues. a false low reading actually results in actions being taken that produce a higher a1c.
proof of which is my child's a1c raising from 9.4 to 10.4 in a very short period of time. this is damaging to
every part of her body. we have also had many pod failures. we have had the pod fail during a bolus. the pdm

this has happened more than once. another pod failure was during insertion of the cannula. we were

applying a new pod when the needle didn't insert. we deactivated the pod and started the process of
removing it when the needle suddenly inserted leaving a bruised bloody spot about the size of a nickle. other
pod failures include errors during basal delivery and errors while simply setting down. I have spoken with our
representative about these issues and he stated that I was priming the pod incorrectly. the representative
said the pod needs to be touching the right side of the pdm to correctly prime. the users manual states the
pod and pdm need to be touching but not on a speci�c side or area. I usually set the pod directly on top of
the pdm while priming, which means they are touching on the right side. since talking to the representative, I
have moved the pod to right side of the pdm and still the issues continue. I have spoken with many others
having the same problems we are. some have even had multiple new pdm sent to them and still the issues
remain. my daughter is (b)(6) old. she is not capable of expressing when her blood sugars are high or low. she
does not understand having to eat an extra 45 carbohydrates (immediately after eating 45 for dinner)
because her pdm has dosed her twice. our insurance will only allow us to get an insulin pump every �ve
years. we cannot switch pumps at the moment. we have switched meters and are using the accu-check nano
and manually entering blood glucose numbers into the pdm. this is very frustrating as it creates an
opportunity for human error, requires more equipment being carried everywhere we go, and eliminates one
of the reasons for us choosing the omnipod to begin with (built in meter). i do not believe the new system
was ready for being put on the market. it has many issues that need to be addressed. everyone of these
issues is life-threatening and could result in death.
 
3800200 “The customer's mother reported that the pod was activated at 10:44 am on (b)(6) 2014. the
customer's blood glucose was 400 mg/dl, and the customer had just eaten 50 grams of carbohydrates, so he
bolused 17 units of insulin. at 3:30 pm, the customer has low blood glucose levels and had a seizure. he fell
over and was unconscious. he was taken to the er by ambulance. the customer was hospitalized for 48 hours.
the doctor was having di�culty bringing the customer's blood glucose level up out of the 30's-40's (mg/dl), so
he removed the pod. the customer was treated with iv glucose. he also su�ered injuries during his fall and
obtained a cracked occiput, 2 small brain contusions, and a small epidural hematoma. the customer has no
memory of the event.
 
3603244 “My (b)(6) year old son has type 1 diabetes, and has used the Insulet Omnipod insulin pump to
manage his diabetes since (b)(6) 2009. In early 2013, Insulet announced approval of new, smaller Omnipod
system. In early July 2013, we transitioned my son to the new system. Since that time, we have experienced a
very high rate of pump failures compared to the previous Omnipod. Speci�cally, the Omnipod has alarmed
and deactivated on 29 separate occasions between (b)(6) 2013, and (b)(6) 2014. Many of the failures occurred
in less than 48 hours of use, with some occurring after as little as three hours of use. Approx. 76 of the pods
have worked normally, resulting in a 28% failure rate (29/105 total pods to date). Eighteen (18) of the 29
failures have occurred in (b)(6) 2013 and (b)(6) 2014 alone. We have not been able to determine a consistent
pattern for when the pods fail. The failures have been during delivery of bolus insulin, near the end of an
extended insulin bolus, and during times of regular basal insulin delivery. The failed pods have also been on
various locations of my son's body (arms, legs, abdomen), and don't seem to exhibit a consistent pattern with
that either. My son is rather lean, but has had generally the same build over the last �ve years of using the
Omnipod. Insulet has been very accommodating in replacing the failed pods and having us send the
malfunctioning pods back to them for analysis, but the problem seems to be getting worse. My son has not
had any adverse health e�ects from these failed Omnipods. However, the failures are adding unwelcome
disruption to his school and home life. In addition, the failed pods are resulting in the disposal of the Insulin
used to �ll the pods. I estimate that we have disposed of approximately 50 units of insulin per pod, or 1450
units total. This waste is costing my insurance company thousands of dollars. If other Omnipod users are
having similar problems, the resulting �nancial loss is troubling. The (b)(4) failed pods have come from lot
numbers 40418 (10), 40563 (7), 40709 (1), 40718 (5), 40719 (2), 40737 (2), 40785 (1), and 40805 (1). I do not
have the "sequence numbers" from each failed Omnipod, but all failures have been reported to the company
and contain that info.”

3763359 The patient's mother reported on (b)(6) 2014 10:44 pm her daughter activated a new pod. at 2:30
pm, she was throwing up and they decided to take her to the hospital. upon arrival, she was placed on an
intravenous therapy and she was given 5mg of zofen. at 9:22pm, the pod was deactivated and there was no
cannula coming out of the pod. the cannula looks as if it had never deployed into the infusion site.
 
3818024 The insulin delivery was noticeably di�erent than another fda approved insulin delivery system. we
have seen what we believe are two problems with the omnipod system on a somewhat regular basis. when
we �rst attach and start a new pump, our daughter will go through a period of 4-8 hours where her blood
sugar is high. later, near the end of the 2-3 day life of a pump, we will see the same behavior again. she will
have consistently high blood sugar levels that just do not seem to respond to insulin in the same way that
they did in the midlife (12-48 hours) of the pump. we have performed an uno�cial experiment that backs up
our claim with some data. we used our previous insulin delivery system, a novolog insulin pen, to deliver 5
units into a cap that covers the needle that works with that pen. we then took an omnipod pod which we felt
was not working near the end of its life (48-72 hours), which we had detached from our daughter without
deactivating, and had it deliver 5 units into an identical cap. we put the two caps side by side and compared
the levels. we did this test on two di�erent occasions and each time the omnipod system delivered noticeably
less insulin. this is consistent with our belief that the omnipod system delivers inconsistent amounts of insulin
over its approved 72 hours of use. we have included copies of the pictures we have taken. frequent high and
subsequent low blood sugar levels.
 
4055921 medical device safety issues - insulet omnipod insulin pump from (b)(6) (anonymity preferred with
the company at this time please, if possible. i am willing to answer any questions.) weekdays: (b)(6). i am
signi�cantly concerned about the safety of the insulet company's omnipod insulin pump for managing blood
sugars and insulin delivery for people with type 1 diabetes. i know that many people use this system without
issues or with limited issues and i've heard of many other people who have had similar problems. (some of
my communications have taken place with other families with diabetes as well as using the diabetes online
community.) i would like to report the continuous problems and safety concerns that my (b)(6) year old child
has had with this system. my child has used the "new version" of this system since (b)(6) 2013. i'm going to
number my points and include "subject" topics on each to hopefully make the information �ow easily. device-
the system consists of a "pdm'' (personal diabetes manager, which also functions as the blood glucose meter)
and maintains all settings for the insulin delivery including bolusing and basal rates. excerpt from their
website on how it's supposed to work: (b)(4) "the pod holds and delivers the insulin. the pdm (personal
diabetes manager) wirelessly programs your personalized insulin delivery, calculates suggested doses and
insulin on board, and has a convenient, built-in freestyle blood glucose meter. " pod failures -back in (b)(6)
2014, a few months after we �rst received the system, there was a week where there were three (3) pod
failures. each time a pod fails its stops delivering insulin and stops communicating with the pdm. over the
next couple of months, there were just a couple of random pod issues as well as several pods falling o� (e.g.
due to swimming.) several weeks went by with minimal pod issues. dead battery - pod failure - (b)(6) 2014 -
today was another example of a pod failure. the pdm did not provide a battery warning but the device just
died due to battery life. when we immediately added new batteries, the time and date were re-entered, then
the system says the pod must be de-activated. when i called the helpline, they said the pod would continue to
deliver the basal rate but they recommend the pod be deactivated. no other functions on the device (such as
the blood sugar testing) would function at all - another safety issue, they also note any boluses and
corrections would have to be manually calculated for the next six hours because of the pod failure. this is a
huge safety issue because there is now no record of recent past boluses based on what they're saying. also,
the pod was just applied yesterday so with pods costing (b)(4)/day), basically two days (or $(b)(4)) were lost
plus the expense of the lost insulin. for comparative purposes, if the battery on the medtronic pump
dies, it has memory and retains all previous information including bolus history. the worst part of it, is
the literal trauma to the child who has to have a new pod removed (as noted, it was only one day old and it is
a huge challenge to remove the pod due to the strong tape (even using various chemicals such as unisolve to
remove.) there is always skin damage after the pod is removed. then applying a new pod has it's own
challenges and pain for the child so having to do it even more frequently than the expected every three days
is ridiculous. no child should have to endure this! pod alarm - when a pod fails the child no longer receives

insulin. the device may or may not alarm. the alarm is a vicious screech that cannot consistently be turned o�
using the pdm, especially if a new pod has already been activated just fall o�. if a new one is activated without
deactivating the old one (e.g. when one pod falls o�), it will continuously alarm. thus the pod has no
connection with the pdm knowing which pod is active at the time. cannot press a button to acknowledge
the alarm.) one would think that each pod device would have a unique (e.g. you identi�er and this data would
be retained in the pdm when that pod is activated. but apparently this is not how it's designed. instead you
must take a needle or end of a paperclip and insert it into some unmarked and di�cult to �nd spot on the
back of the pod and insert it into the pod to silence the alarm. if this doesn't work, and often it doesn't,
people have recommended placing the pod in the freezer to silence it, or use a hammer to destroy the pod so
it would stop alarming. (remember this device is being used by young children.) pdm errors, pod failures and
pins - in the course of three (3) days over this past (b)(6) weekend, we had six (6) di�erent pod failures and a
new thing - "pdm errors". when the �rst "pdm error" message occurred, i called insulet and their rep took the
reference number and told me i had to remove the back battery door of the pdm (not the pod this time), then
place a pin or needle or end of a paperclip into a tiny hole on the back of the pdm to "reset" the pdm
machine. when this is done, it completely loses the time and date info and then cannot track past insulin on
board, nor can it calculate a bolus for at least four hours. because of this loss of communication, the system
automatically deactivates the pod only to have to be replaced again. this process of sticking needles, pins or
paper clips into tiny obscure holes on the pod or pdm device is ridiculous and completely unsafe, especially if
a child is expected to safely use this device. (we were traveling staying in a hotel room at the time and didn't
have a paperclip or pin to use every time.) this also leads me to question the safety because it seems like
the pdm has no memory of the "messages" or signals it's sending to the pod and how much insulin the
pod has delivered. it just loses communication with the pod that is on the child's body. so we replaced
the pod again and again and restarted the pdm several times. no pod-pdm communication after speaking
with other people using the system (at the children with diabetes conference including reps from the insulet
company), they noted that the pdm is supposed to be able to work within 5 feet of the pod (on the
body); however, this one barely worked when it was within even 5 inches of the pod. after the fourth or
�fth pod failure/pdm error and innumerable hours on the phone with omnipod customer service, i requested
that they replace the entire pdm. the customer service rep, (b)(4), quite adamantly refused to do this because
she said the pod was allegedly still delivering basal insulin (by this time i have no faith whatsoever that
my child is getting insulin.) i explained the part about the pdm not communicating unless it is directly next
to the pod (instead of the �ve foot range) then �nally with frustration, she said she would send a replacement
pdm by next tuesday for that issue (but not for the pdm errors.) i also asked that they replace the entire batch
of pods (as these were all from one batch.) she said i would need management, approval for that and i would
have to call back the following week. note: even if it was delivering basal insulin, the pod was not able to
deliver insulin boluses which keep a child alive when they eat any food with carbohydrates. expense as
mentioned, each pod failure and pdm error results in loss of at least the $(b)(4) pod (which only lasts for three
days) as well as all of the insulin in the pod (a minimum of (b)(4) units each time.) with all of the pod failures
and errors. i have lost at least entire bottle of novolog insulin which is also very expensive. they have replaced
a couple of the pods but not all that have failed. customer service: i have had to spend countless hours of my
valuable time dealing with the omnipod customer service reps who generally seem to have no idea what any
of the data means and very limited knowledge of the product. when i ask them what the various reference
numbers mean (that appear in the pdm when a pod fails), they just say, "we don't know, they don't tell us. our
engineers use that information to make the product better." if the codes de�ne a list of things that are
happening with the device, why would they not have an explanation list of the various reference codes? that
could serve as "teaching tool for patients so if they do consistently encounter a particular reference code,
perhaps that data could be used for education, as well as improving the product when trends are identi�ed.
new pdm  - more pod failures. we did receive the new pdm, got the settings set up late last night, then applied
a new pod to my child. with the �rst bolus, the pod failed again in the middle of the bolus! i called insulet this
morning and asked to speak with a manager. i left a message. i did hear back from someone this afternoon
who seems to be a management person and she seemed concerned and wanted to help. she said she would
send some replacement pods to try. (however, we will not be able to do this until my child returns from
diabetes camp.) model#: not available at this moment.

4115529 “An email communication was received to report that on (b)(6) 2014, before going to bed, the
patient's blood glucose reading was 75 mg/dl and he had not had anything to eat for dinner. On (b)(6) 2014, at
5:00 am, he woke up and took a shower. During his shower, he fainted; foam was coming out of his mouth
and his nose was bleeding. His mother called for the paramedics and upon their arrival, his bg was reading 29
mg/dl. He was treated with glucose intravenously and did not have to go to the hospital.
 
4189290 “Time: 1:50 pm, blood glucose (mg/dl): 283. time: 3:00 p.m, blood glucose (mg/dl): 324. Time 3:55pm,
blood glucose (mg/dl): 294 - pod deactivated. The customer's mother reported that the needle deployed 10
minutes after it was supposed to.
 
4196364 The customer's mother reported on (b)(6) 2014 her daughter's blood glucose history is as follows:
time: 2:18pm, bg(mg/dl): 300, time: 11:43pm, bg(mg/dl): 383. she stated that the pod was not sticking to her
skin while she was at school. she was having chest pains and trouble breathing so she took her to the
emergency room.
 
4377205 The customer's mother reported that the customer was taken to the er for a second time that day.
the customer had a blood glucose in the 400-500 mg/dl range and had been vomiting all day. the customer
was treated for nausea and given a prescription for ondansetron. the mother treated the high bg with a
manual injection of insulin.
 
4253540 My (b)(6) son received the omnipod insulin pump manufactured by insulet recently. on every third
day or last day of wear, the insulin pod seemingly failed because his glucose levels increased to abnormally
high levels. we informed insulet corporation of the problem and the company sent us a new omnipod
replacement pdm device. however, on the �rst day of using the replacement omnipod pdm device on (b)(6),
my son's glucose rose to 240 mg/dl on the �rst day, after one meal. this glucose value is atypical for him. the
pod did not give any warning alarm to notify us of any insulin delivery problems. the humalog insulin that was
inside of the pod was fresh and expires in 2017. my son continues to receive lantus as his basal insulin and he
did not miss any lantus doses. we do not use the insulin pump or pod for his basal insulin delivery but only
for his mealtime boluses. after this high glucose value, we instead gave him a traditional shot of humalog 1
unit via a pen shot and his glucose came down to a normal level or 116 mg/dl after 20 minutes.
 
4527412 “The patient's mother reported while sitting in the back seat of the car her daughter's blood glucose
result was 60 mg/dl and that she was having a seizure so she was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance. At
the hospital a bg meter comparison was performed. Her pdm read 223 mg/dl vs 481 mg/dl for the hospital's
meter. She stayed in the hospital for a week before being released. She did not provide any further
information regarding the hospitalization or her treatment.
 
4874987 The patient's mother reported that her daughter was having an attack, she was trying to hurt
herself, she's going out of control and this is how she acts when her bg is high. she called 911 and upon the
paramedics arrival and bg meter comparisons were performed. her pdm read 160 mg/dl vs bg in the 500's
mg/dl for the paramedic's meter. they gave her a manual injection of insulin (exact dosage was not provided)
and stayed with her for an hour until she was stable. she con�rmed that she was using the (uncleared)
freestyle lite strips.
 
4838212 Omnipod moved to a smaller insulin pod. ever since omnipod moved to the smaller insulin pod
extra insulin has been being released from the pod during �ights. i was unaware this was happening. my
doctor at the time was also unaware. however, i was expressing my concern to a colleague who then did
some research online and discovered that the nih had tested medtronic and animas insulin pumps a few
years ago and proved that extra insulin is being delivered during �ights. i then went to my doctor and told her
about it - which she was unaware. so i saw someone else in the practice who had con�rmed she knew that
animas and medtronic delivered extra insulin. i travel on average 8 �ights a month so this has been a big
problem for me. i tried many compensating behaviors to account for this such as running temporary basals,
turning o� the insulin pump, eating extra food before �ights and under blousing, bringing numerous supplies
to treat hypoglycemia. i have also reported this numerous times to omnipod. i have now resorted to literally

removing the omnipod on �ights. what i have observed when removing omnipod on �ights is that insulin is
bubbling out of the cannula during take-o�. but not at any other time of the �ight. i am very insulin sensitive -
only requiring around 12-18 units total in one day - therefore the extra insulin - which the nih reported could
be on average (b)(6) for animas and medtronic is equivalent to eating a big meal for me. i am very, very
concerned about this issue and want other who are insulin sensitive to be aware. i am so afraid that a child or
someone who is unaware of the issue will go on a �ight and have a very serious hypoglycemic event.
 
5057747 The patient's mother reported on (b)(6) 2015 at 10:31 her daughter activated a new pod and her
blood glucose history is as follows: time: 11:51, bg (mg/dl): 199. (b)(6). time: 7:52 am, bg (mg/dl): 199. she was
vomiting so she went to see her doctor and after they did some blood work they realized that her bg was
reading over 500 mg/dl. she was then rushed to the emergency room where she was diagnosed with diabetic
ketoacidosis. they placed her on an insulin drip. she was in a comatose state for 2 days. the pod was removed
and discarded. she stay in the hospital and was released on (b)(6) 2015.
 
5128686 The customer reported that her daughter's blood glucose was at a low of 20 mg/dl and then reached
> 600 mg/dl. The patient was in a coma, was treated at the hospital and eventually came out of it.
 
5134737 The patient's mother reported her daughter had to go to the emergency room and that she had
been in two comas as results. The doctor believe that there is something wrong with the pdm as the patient's
blood glucose keep going from low to high. Her blood glucose history is as follows:
 
5180928 The customer's mother reported that her daughter's blood glucose was reading at 238 mg/dl with an
alternative meter and that the pdm meter was reading at 349 mg/dl. patent went to hospital and diagnosed
with diabetic ketoacidosis. at the hospital a bg comparison was done and that the pdm was reading 100
points higher than the hospital's meter.
 
5207721 “Our son has an Omnipod insulin pump. He has had 3 pods that failed to deploy the needle and
insert, but when deactivated and taken o� and set down with a little jolt all three deployed after removal. First
2 pods were on (b)(6) 2015, the 3rd was (b)(6) 2015.”
 
5235214 My (b)(6) daughter, diagnosed at (b)(6) with type 1 diabetes, has been using insulet omnipod for four
years. though some isolated equipment problems sporadically, the recent failures of this omnipod, resulted
in high blood sugars and ketoacidosis. stress beyond belief, trouble in school, missed school, loss of sleep and
in�icted illness which further increase blood sugars. additional pod changes which are extremely painful and
many, many tears. ketoacidosis was treated with additional insulin which were painful boluses as well. poor
kid su�ered and was almost hospitalized due to these product failures. now i am advocating to obtain
replacements for these pods in this lot.
 
5223373 “The mother reported that the patient had a seizure and was admitted to the hospital for
hypoglycemia while wearing a pod. she was treated with glucose intravenously.”
 
5245592 It was reported by the patient's father that she has been hospitalized nine times.
 
5210435 My son has been using the omniopod system for about four weeks. during those four weeks he has
experienced numerous episodes of hyperglycemia after insertion of new pods. he had to go to the
emergency room and to his doctor using this period due to hyperglycemia and medical illnesses caused by
his hyperglycemia.
 
5268054 The patient's mother reported that her daughter was found unconscious due to high blood glucose
and that she had to be admitted into the intensive care unit for a few days.
 
5290573 Failures of insulet corporation's omnipod insulin pumps. omnipod insulin pumps have two
operating components: a small disposable pump, called "pod," worn on the body of a diabetic patient, and a

several feet. (b)(6), living in (b)(6), had three of his omnipod insulin pods fail consecutively on (b)(6) 2015 and
(b)(6) 2015, while spending time with his father, (b)(6). all three failures were similar: unexplained rise in (b)(6)
blood glucose, to very high levels, starting a couple of hours after a bolus, sometimes the correction dose, is
administered using the pod. the changes of (b)(6) glucose levels are observed using his continuous glucose
monitor (cgm) which is veri�ed intermittently using (b)(6) blood glucose meter in the pdm. shortly after (b)(6)
has his pod replaced, his blood glucose decreases to normal levels. very recently, an additional problem was
manifested: unexpectedly low blood glucose only several hours after applying and activating a new pod.
these problems were observed by (b)(6) father, (b)(6), who cared for (b)(6) during that time. (b)(6) observed
similar problems with (b)(6) glucose control starting at least as early as (b)(6) 2015. but (b)(6) did not suspect
failures of the pods until (b)(6) 2015 and, thus, has not documented those previous suspected failures. (b)(6)
does not recall observing such problems during the summer of the year 2015. observation is possible only
every other weekend which (b)(6) spends with his father. (b)(6) mother, (b)(6), claims that there were no
problems with the pods. but (b)(6) has told his father on (b)(6) 2015, that the school nurse and his class aide
have remarked about increase number of occurrences of (b)(6) having high blood glucose and low blood
glucose. (b)(6) has reported my observations, of problems with my son's glucose control, to insulet customer
service on (b)(6) 2015 on the telephone and then very early in the morning on (b)(6) in writing, (b)(6). but
insulet's almost disinterested response is a reason to doubt that they will diagnose the cause of these
malfunctions. their focus is "how soon would you like to receive replacement pots?" despite it being
clear that replacement pods are a bad idea now. reporting on telephone was very frustrating and
�nding a way to submit a written report to insulet via the internet has taken a little time, too. (b)(6)
had to insist on reporting in writing to get help �nding out how to use the submission form on their
website. on (b)(6), insulet's customer-service representative has reiterated to (b)(6) that he report any
future problems to insulet on telephone rather than in writing. the customer-service representative
has refused to give to (b)(6) the full names of the managers who have told her to say it to (b)(6). insulet
is not interested in obtaining logs from (b)(6) continuous glucose monitor and from the omnipod pdm.
insulet's customer service refuse to put (b)(6) in contact with insulet's engineering team. lot #'s and serial #'s
of the 3 pods subject of this report: lot #l41580, sn #(b)(4); lot #l41580, sn #(b)(4); lot # l41580, sn #(b)(4), see

5311383 The patient's blood glucose level was over 500 mg/dl. the pod was not worn. the patient's mother
stated that cannula deployed 5 minutes later after it had already been set to the side.
 
5348044 “The patient's grandmother reported that the patient was hospitalized as a result of hyperglycemia
and an in�amed pancreas. the patient was also vomiting.”
 
5587804 The freestyle omnipod's failed to deliver insulin. they report that it is from pod failure, but i believe it
is much more than that. i have tried contacting the manufacturer for a refund, and additional people who are
supposed to call me back have failed to do so. my alc has increased, and my kidneys are showing damage
from ine�cient delivery of insulin. this began to happen at the end of last year, but i was guaranteed that
other pods delivered insulin �ne. i am proof that they don't. i have spent many precious hours trying to
get the company to resolve this and my problem, but they refuse to move forward and do the right
thing. i cannot a�ord to purchase another device until i receive a refund. i have had blood sugars 400 and
even above, this is a�ecting my life in a very negative manner, and the device needs to be taken o� the
market until a solution is �gured out. people like me have su�ered from high blood sugars which
come with terrible side e�ects. the device and the company need to be investigated and closed until
the units no longer damage individuals health.
 
5821902 my daughter is a type 1 diabetic and uses the omnipod system. she constantly has defective pods.
recently, she was in the hospital and her endocrinologist had the in-house omnipod rep come to the hospital
and put a pod on her. when she checked her sugar in order to eat, the system told her the pod wasn't
working, so the rep brought another pod. this past weekend, she put 200 units in her pod, went to eat and
her system told her she did not have enough insulin for her meal. she began throwing up. her sugar was so
high, it would not register on the meter, it just read "high." it continued to read "high" so she began giving

herself injections with her novolog pen. she has a new pod but is continuing to have readings 240, 250. she
celebrated her (b)(6) birthday today, so she's wanted me to put o� calling the doctor because, more than
likely, she'll end up back in the hospital. i've been reading reviews on the omnipod system and see that they
have had recalls, warnings, lawsuits, etc. i'm not sure what to do at this point. i'm not sure what the return
policy is. i still owe money on the system, but with the problems we continue to have and seems the
problems are worsening, i'm strongly considering no longer using the system. i plan to discuss with the doctor
in the morning and probably the company from whom we bought the omnipod system.
 
5434486 the patient's mother reported that her child had to be hospitalized for a day and a half with diabetic
ketoacidosis due to the pdm not giving the correct insulin doses.

a shunt placed for dialysis
 
5800256 “The patient's mother reported that her daughter had to be hospitalized due to high blood glucose
levels. At the hospital she was diagnosed with an enlarged kidney, heartbeat of 183, blood infection, kidney
infection, and had a stent placed in her kidney. She did not provide any further information regarding the
hospitalization.
 
5753587 The patient¿s father reported that his son was vomiting and that he was nearing a coma situation by
the time he arrived at the emergency room. he was admitted into the intensive care unit with diabetic
ketoacidosis.
 
5749303 The patient's father reported his daughter's blood glucose history is as follows: time: 5:05 am, bg
(mg/dl): 95. he then noticed a pod alarm. 10 minutes later 11. she had a diabetic seizure while she was
sleeping so he called for the paramedics. upon their arrival her bg was reading at 11 mg/dl (with the emt's
meter) and the pdm was reading at 95 and 94 mg/dl. they used something to help bring up her bg levels. dad
stated that he was not sure what the paramedics gave his daughter. she was taken to the hospital where they
monitored her bg levels overnight.
 
5983649 Patient's parent reported that their child had a reaction to the adhesive (itchy, red, raised bumps)
causing the patient to itch the pod o� during the night. unaware that the pod was no longer attached the
patient, blood glucose level rose to 479 mg/dl and patient was taken to the hospital. patient was diagnosed
with dka (diabetic ketoacidosis).

blood glucose (bg) levels reached 898 mg/dl. she was diagnosed with diabetic ketoacidosis and treated with
an insulin drip. the pod was worn between 4 and 24 hours
 
5878200 New pod was placed on and his blood glucose level increased to 380 mg/dl. the doctor and mother
both feel the pdm is having issues communicating with the pod, since the pods didn't give errors and the
pods appeared normal and the insulin was �ne. pdm was requested to be replaced.

FYI - there was a misread with patient #3. This article states that the PDM was giving falsely low results,
Insulet blamed Abbott's strips, but the doctor checked the patient's strips with a control solution and found
them in range. That is not what the FDA report says. According to the report as highlighted, the doctor
checked the patient's strips and found them reading extremely low (23 mg/dL). It says that the doctor then
used *another set of strips* and got in-range results. So in the case of #3 it does appear the issue was a bad
lot of strips, not the Omnipod PDM.


Editor Thu, 11/24/2016 ­ 22:09


A few points: 1. We believe the totality of our research (please read the entire report and all 51 quotes
from parents and users in Exhibit 4) tells us the PDM has a product defect. We do not pin all of our
comments on this one example that you are choosing to highlight. 2. You comment suggests that Insulet
should be believed and we should not be believed. What is your basis for this? We trust patients and users
to tell us the truth. We do not trust the management of any medical device company and suggest you
should question them as well. We believe fraud in the medical device sector is rampant. This is one of the
reasons we focus our attention on the sector. Do you think our research is wrong and the PDM does not
have defects? We would enjoy hearing your thoughts on this. 3. We expect more clarity soon on the
trusthworthiness of management.
