NVAX


The RSV virus changes from season to season which makes creating effective
RSV vaccines challenging.


Novavax has not changed its RSV F vaccine in 3 years and uses the same vaccine
from a previously failed trial.


We believe maternal immunization does not provide adequate antibody protection
for infants.


Novavax’s actions appear to have raised thestatistical hurdle for the Phase 3 trial.


We are short Novavax with a price target of $0.


RSV changes every season and humans do not achieve immunity from RSV

In general, there are two types of vaccines. Lifetime vaccines, such as Hepatitis A, help
recipients develop antibodies that will protect them for their entire life. These vaccines
are long-lasting because the disease from which people are being protected does not
mutate from year to year. In contrast, annual vaccines, such as the influenza vaccine,
must be given every year because the infecting virus changes every year. Novavax
(NASDAQ:NVAX) is attempting to develop a single RSV vaccine that does not change
even though the RSV virus changes. Researchers have found great variability in the
virus strains over time. One study notes that researchers “ have shown a worldwide
distribution of RSV strains with both local and global replacement of dominant viruses
with time.”


In layman’s terms, this means that the virus changes from season to season, much like
the flu vaccine. That’s why one year’s flu vaccine doesn’t properly shield you from the
next season’s flu strains. While it’s our understanding that the flu vaccine changes more
often than RSV, the principle is the same. As a result, RSV “ reinfection is common
throughout the lifespan,” as per the National Foundation for Infectious Diseases.


In addition, even after being infected with RSV, humans don’t achieve lifelong immunity.
The American Lung Associates states, “ Because people do not form long-lasting
immunity to RSV, they can become infected repeatedly over their lifetime.”

We believe the two points above have significant negative implications for Novavax’s
RSV vaccine, which is named RSV F, and we believe Novavax’s PREPARE Phase 3
trial to protect infants from RSV infections via maternal immunization is likely to fail.


Novavax uses the same RSV F vaccine every season despite changes to the RSV
virus


Given the constantly changing dynamics of RSV, we believe Novavax’s approach to
vaccine formulation is likely to prove ineffective. We note that Novavax has used the
same vaccine every year. In fact, Novavax’s RSV F vaccine in the PREPARE Phase 3
trial is the same RSV F vaccine that failed in the RESOLVE Phase 3 trial – no changes
to the vaccine have been made since then.


The current PREPARE Phase 3 has been ongoing since December 2015, which means
that Novavax has been using the same vaccine for nearly 3 years while wild RSV strains
have continued to mutate around the world in unpredictable ways. Therefore, we believe
Novavax’s vaccine is unlikely to work in the PREPARE Phase 3 trial.


In fact, this was definitively shown in a previous Phase 3 trial that Novavax conducted in
elderly patients. In that Phase 3 trial called RESOLVE, Novavax’s RSV F vaccine
performed almost the same as the placebo arm in the primary endpoint and actually
performed worse than placebo in a key secondary endpoint.

In our opinion, Novavax is now trying the same failed vaccine in a harder to treat patient
population (infants) through an unproven and unestablished method (via maternal
immunization).


Maternal immunization provides limited help to infants


Even if Novavax’s RSV F vaccine does provide immunity from RSV, we think maternal
transfer immunization provides limited help to infants. First, we want to make clear that
pregnant mothers are not given vaccines to protect the infant through maternal
immunization. This is simply not accepted nor practiced. The FDA states, “ Currently,
there are no vaccines approved by FDA specifically for use during pregnancy to protect
the infant.”


The two predominant vaccines, Tdap and influenza, are given to pregnant mothers to
“prevent disease in the mother,” as shown in slide 10 of this FDA update for vaccines
given to pregnant women.

While some people may believe that vaccines for the mother provide fetal and neonatal
benefit through the passive transfer of protective antibodies across the placenta, the
antibodies from the mother don’t last long enough to provide robust protection to the
infant. This is because of the short half-life of the antibodies that are transferred.


Of the antibodies produced in the human body, only “ maternal immunoglobulin G is
actively transported across the placenta.” However, the half-life of immunoglobulin G is
only 10-21 days, which is extremely short. This has significant implications for the
PREPARE Phase 3 study since antibodies disappear over time and aren’t reproduced.
The only thing that remains are memory B cells which are specific to the virus strain and
don’t confer immunity to different strains in the future.


Pregnant mothers in the PREPARE Phase 3 study are administered the vaccine in the
third trimester, which is from Week 27 until birth (usually at Week 40). If we assume that
the pregnant women in PREPARE are dosed after the start of the third trimester at
Week 30, and that they reach peak antibody levels after 4 weeks at Week 34, we
calculate that by the time of birth, the baby will have at best 25% of the peak antibody
titer, assuming a 21 day half-life.


If we assume a 10 day half-life, then the baby will only have ~6% of peak antibody titer.

Moreover, we know that “ RSV does not usually occur until a baby is 4 to 6 weeks old,”
and that RSV hospitalizations in infants peak at around 8 weeks. We calculate that
during that key 4 week span, infants in the trial will have between 0% to 13% of peak
antibody titer. We don’t believe this is nearly robust enough to provide meaningful
benefit to infants from RSV.


Novavax’s PREPARE Phase 3 trial faces a very high bar for success, which we
believe it won’t meet

We also believe that the bar for success is incredibly high for Novavax in its Phase 3
PREPARE trial and that Novavax has made it worse by taking actions that raise the
statistical hurdle.


Based on research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, Journal of Global
Health, and from Novavax’s low reported RSV rates in previous Phase 2 and Phase 3
trials, we believe the incidence rate for moderate to severe RSV in infants is around 2%.
A low infection rate has significant implications. Novavax has stated that the Phase 3
trial is powered with a lower bound confidence interval of 30%. With such a low RSV
attack rate, that means that Novavax has to show a huge difference in the 2 arms to hit
statistical significance.


We calculate that for the trial to hit its p-value, it needs to exhibit a 58% difference in the
2 arms for the lower confidence bound interval to be greater than 30%. In other words,
we believe the PREPARE Phase 3 trial has to show a 2.5% vs 1.5% difference in the
arms. That’s extremely difficult to do given what we know about the trial, which we go
into next.


We’ve spoken with an experienced biostatistician who has reviewed Novavax’s
publically released information about the PREPARE Phase 3 trial’s “ informational
analysis” conducted late 2017, and the biostatistician believes that the informational
analysis was a form of interim analysis. We believe this means that the informational
analysis spent up some alpha and increased the chances of Type 1 error. To account for
this, Novavax has to raise the threshold for statistical significance at the trial’s final look.


In addition, we know that Novavax is essentially stopping the trial early. The PREPARE
Phase 3 trial was originally designed to have 8,255 patients, and, as of last year, it was
supposed to run until May of 2020. Now, Novavax is stopping the trial 2 years early with
just 4,636 patients, or a little more than half of the original targeted population. Fewer
patients means fewer events. Accordingly, we believe that the PREPARE Phase 3 trial
will have to show even greater differences between the 2 arms to hit statistical
significance.

We are short Novavax with a price target of $0


We are short Novavax. We believe the PREPARE Phase 3 trial will fail, just like the
RESOLVE Phase 3 trial. This would be Novavax’s second large Phase 3 failure in RSV,
which we believe will render the program worthless.


We also believe the Novavax’s NanoFlu vaccine has limited utility. In our opinion, the
vaccine has shown underwhelming immunogenicity data, and will require large and
expensive efficacy trials for FDA approval. We may discuss this in greater detail in the
future.


In fact, we believe Novavax’s entire vaccine platform is worthless. A close examination
of the company’s history shows that despite planned vaccine announcements for
malaria, Zika, Ebola, and pandemic influenza vaccine in its history, Novavax has failed
to develop any of them.


Moreover, we note that Novavax has a Going Concern warning from its auditors (see
Note 2 in the latest 10-Q), and that Novavax has less than 1 year of cash remaining at
current burn rates. Even if Novavax had adequate cash, it still has a $325 million
convertible bond on its balance sheet that will become due in a little over 3 years.


We believe the company will soon be insolvent and that its vaccine programs are
worthless. Our price target for Novavax is $0, and we believe it is a compelling short.
