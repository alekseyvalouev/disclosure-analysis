on weekends or after regular tasks are done. New staff are sometimes told to clean toilets, 
and taking days off is seen as lazy. Nagamori makes no apologies.” 
  
“These days, if you tell people to put everything into their work, you’re soon dubbed a 
black company,” he says, referring to the Japanese term for firms that flout labor 
standards. “I have no problem saying that. If you don’t work, you lose. The only ones I 
can’t stand are layabouts.”

“Nagamori decries what he sees as a lack of ambition in Japan. Too many young people 
are content with only “small happiness,” like going home to their children in the evening 
rather than working late to become their company’s next president, he says.” 


 
Only two months later, Mr. Nagamori apparently completely changed his views on working 
conditions:139 


 
“But Nagamori spent much of Monday's press event explaining how Nidec is earning 
more by working shorter hours. ‘There are no more moretsu working for us,’ he said, 
using a buzzword once applied with admiration to corporate Japan's most die-hard 
workaholics.” 
 
“For a year, the company has urged employees to leave work on time. They cannot stay 
past their regular hours without obtaining permission from a supervisor that morning, and 
overtime is not approved for unnecessary tasks.” 
 
“Overtime was slashed 30% without affecting productivity. ‘Even if there is still work to 
be done, they tell us to go home when it's past time to punch out,’ a young research and 
development staffer said. ‘That has made us think hard about how to work more 
efficiently.’ 


 
Before Mr. Nagamori publicly changed his mind on working conditions, the impression that we 
got from conversations with sell-side analysts was that they felt the demanding culture was a 
positive for investors, and was another demonstration of Mr. Nagamori’s value.  The impression 
that we have received from the sell-side since Mr. Nagamori’s reversal is that he is once again 
doing something smart for investors.  To the extent our impressions are correct, this illustrates 
how unquestioning many investors have been of Mr. Nagamori – in our view, blindly accepting 
that his every move is a great one. 
 
There was at least one time that Mr. Nagamori was pretty cold, and the result raises significant 
corporate governance concerns.  In our opinion, Nidec effected a bailout of Mr. Nagamori.  In 
December 2008, Nidec made what appears to be a JPY 14.5 billion emergency loan to Mr. 
Nagamori (via an asset management company he indirectly owns).140  In early 2009, the board 
and auditor realized the loan was a violation of U.S. securities law.  Mr. Nagamori repaid the 
loan by selling Nidec shares – 87% of the shares were purchased by Nidec.141

Nidec’s Ex-HDD Valuation Approaches Facebook’s – this Does Not Make Sense 
 
We value Nidec’s shares at JPY 4,764 – less than half of the current price. 
 
We estimate that Nidec’s current share price presently implies an enterprise value of its non-
HDD businesses that is 21.5x LTM EBITDA.  Facebook Inc. (FB) trades at 24.9x EV / LTM 
EBITDA.  FB is growing organically at 35%+ per year.  In contrast, Nidec seems lucky to 
generate 5% organic growth in a given year.  We see many of Nidec’s products as 
commoditized. 
 
Our research indicates that approximately 40% of Nidec’s EBITDA, or JPY 74 billion, is derived 
from HDD motors.  Based on HDD comparables, we think Nidec’s HDD business should trade 
at 7.5x Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDA or lower, a premium over its main competitor Minebea 
Co. Ltd. (6479 JP) and on the high end of the pure play HDD comparables.  This results in a JPY 
555 billion HDD motor segment valuation.  The HDD motor industry effectively consists of only 
Minebea and Nidec (approximately 20% share and 80% share respectively).142  TDK is another 
Japanese HDD supplier that trades at 6.5x EV/EBITDA and historically has traded at very low 
valuations.  HDD manufacturers Seagate and Western Digital trade at 7.6x to 5.8x EV / 
EBITDA, respectively.  HDD companies have historically traded at low valuations due to slower 
growth in PCs and technology obsolescence risks (see the chart below for historical EV/EBITDA 
multiples). However, Seagate has been able to perform better on the enterprise side and has 
historically been a better executor and thus the premium over Western Digital.  We give Nidec’s 
HDD business a slight valuation premium over Minebea, although their product lines and 
financial profiles are very similar (see comparable table below).

forma financials changed due to the acquisition. 
 
Holding the HDD motor segment valuation constant at JPY 555 billion and taking into account 
Nidec’s remaining ex-HDD EBITDA of JPY 111 billion, Nidec’s ex-HDD implied valuation is 
21.5x EV/EBITDA – very close to that of Facebook.
Page 43 of 53	


Revaluing the non-HDD Business 
 
With a low single digit organic growth profile, we think the ex-HDD business needs to be 
revalued at lower multiples.  The Auto, Appliance, Industrial and Commercial (AACI) segment 
accounts for 37% of Nidec’s EBITDA and receives the highest valuation.  However, similar 
companies in the auto sector are growing revenues at 7% and trade in the 6.0x to 9.0x range (e.g. 
Denso, Continental, Visteon and Delphi) – not 21.5x.   
 
We believe the ex-HDD business should be revalued to 8.0x, which is still a premium to many of 
its peers in the AACI segment.  At an 8.0x valuation multiple, the non-HDD business valuation 
is JPY 888 billion, and when combined with the HDD business at 7.5x, our total estimate for 
enterprise value is JPY 1,420 billion or a combined EV/EBITDA multiple of 7.7x.  This implies 
a downside to the current stock price of over 50% or an implied share price of 4,764.  Given 
Nidec’s issues with accounting transparency, the stock could have even further downside.

Prescription for Transparency 
 
While Nidec’s share price has been increasing in recent years, in our opinion the company has 
materially reduced transparency.  We call upon Nidec to reverse its decision to no longer be 
subject to U.S. filing requirements.  We believe investors would be well-served by simple, 
consistent, and transparent segment and product group disclosures.  Most of all, we wish to see 
an attitude that respects investors’ rights to clearly see the company for what it is – the good and 
the bad.  Companies that successfully pump their stocks on the back of incomplete or misleading 
disclosures divert capital from companies that are more forthright, and thus harm markets, 
investors, and other companies. 
 
The most pressing issue is that Nidec is terminating its sponsorship of its U.S. ADSes, and will 
therefore cease filing financials in the U.S.143  We see this as a negative for both foreign and 
Japanese investors.  Nidec claims that its goals in listing its ADSes in 2001 have been fulfilled, 
																																																								
143 https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1158967/000115896716000057/f160502noticeondelistingamer.htm
Page 46 of 53	


so it does not make sense for the company to continue to file.144  We do not think Nidec is being 
completely honest about its reasons.  We see the de-listing decision as Nidec quitting while it is 
ahead.   
 
The U.S. securities regulations – as imperfect as they are – in our opinion, mandate more 
disclosure than those of any other market.  Nidec has established itself as a core Japanese 
holding for international investors, and we suspect management feels that continuing to be 
subject to the increased transparency requirements of the U.S. would make it easier for investors 
to see Nidec’s problems and inconsistencies.  Nidec is larger than it has ever been, and the 
additional cost of maintaining U.S. reporting is inconsequential.  Cessation of U.S. reporting 
seems incongruent with maintaining investor relations representatives on three continents.145   
 
Even in its U.S. filings, Nidec’s reporting strikes us as unnecessarily confusing.  Some of the 
most critical elements for Nidec investors to know are the performance of the HDD and 
Automotive product groups.  It seems unnecessary and unhelpful to bundle Automotive with 
Appliance, Commercial, and Industrial motors.  (We also fail to see the relationship between 
Appliance on one hand, and Commercial and Industrial motors on the other.)  We believe 
investors would benefit if Nidec’s filings separately reported HDD, Other Small Precision 
Motors, Automotive, Appliances, Commercial and Industrial, Machinery, Electronic and Optical, 
and Other.  We further call upon Nidec to provide both organic (ex-currency fluctuations) and 
consolidated metrics for each of the aforementioned product groups.  The organic and 
consolidated product group metrics Nidec should provide investors include revenue, EBITDA, 
operating profit, pretax income, and net income.   
 
Nidec should make clear which entities (or portions of entities) report into which product group. 
While Nidec generally breaks out product group revenue and operating profits on calls and in 
presentations, it is unclear how these numbers are calculated.  As we discuss in this report, there 
are apparently businesses inside of entities (i.e., reporting segments) that can be grouped into 
product groups different from the product groups matching the entities’ primary businesses.  The 
lack of clarity about which entities contribute what revenue and operating profits to each product 
group gives rise to our suspicions that Nidec manipulates its product group disclosures. 
 
We call upon Nidec to disclose historical financial performance for every business it acquires, 
regroups, or reclassifies; and, to continue to provide such disclosure on for at least four quarters 
after the transaction.  This way, investors could better understand how these maneuvers affect 
reported performance.  
 
Nidec seems to use its All Others reporting segment in ways that could mislead investors.  For 
example, after Nidec acquired Elesys, Elesys sat inside All Others for two quarters before being 
transferred to Nidec Motors & Actuators.146  (It appears that when it was transferred out of All 
Others to Motors & Actuators, it was grouped with approximately JPY 20 billion in annual 
revenue from another business.  If we are correct about the bundling, it is also unclear whether 
that apparent additional business transfer suddenly boosted reported Automotive group results.

146 FY2014 20-F, p. 63.
Page 47 of 53	


 
Entities with revenues totaling JPY 106 billion (in the year before they were reclassified) 
disappeared from segment reporting because they were moved into other segments.  This number 
represents 9.1% of FY 2015 total revenue pre-elimination.  Pre-reclassification revenue from 
entities moved into the All Others segment accounted for JPY 70.0 billion, showing the growing 
scope of All Others.  In FY 2015, All Others represented 15.0% of pre-elimination revenue, 
versus 11.5% in FY 2011.  All Others represented 22.4% (JPY 29.0 billion) of pre-elimination 
operating profit in FY 2015.  The incessant movement of entities into All Others (and 
occasionally out of the segment) strikes us as odd and unhelpful to investors.   
 
Nidec’s incessant reclassifications and restatements make it very difficult to compare its 
reporting segments from period to period.  For investors to access to S&P Capital IQ, the 
inordinate amount of changes to segment reporting can be seen by looking at quarterly segment 
reporting, and selecting All Filings (as opposed to only original or the latest filings).  We hope 
that Nidec will minimize its restatements and reclassifications going forward. 
 
The Nidec Corporation segment is also confusing, as it has significant inter-company sales 
(84.1% of its total); and manufactures products across multiple product groups.  This entity’s 
operating profit has increased from 10.0% of pre-elimination operating profit in FY 2011 to 
13.9% in FY 2015.   
 
We see Nidec as wanting to increasingly control investors’ perceptions of the company’s 
performance, rather than presenting unvarnished information.  This is unfortunate and 
unnecessary.  Mr. Nagamori has already cemented his position as one of Japan’s greatest 
industrialists.  He is an amazing executive, but he is not supernatural.  To us, Nidec seems 
unwilling to admit that is unable to replicate the success of its HDD business as it diversifies.  
We urge Nidec and Mr. Nagamori to become comfortable their impressive achievements, rather 
than continuing to voice unattainable targets and obfuscating the reality of Nidec’s 
diversification strategy.   
 
While an appropriate level of transparency would likely result in a much lower valuation, it 
would be a net benefit for Japan’s capital markets and economy.  Long-side activists help to 
make companies more worthy of capital investment.  Short-side activists help prevent companies 
from taking capital for inefficient uses.  Companies that have attracted more capital than they 
deserve starve other companies of capital, and harm investors.  Japan – and the world – therefore 
need both long-side and short-side activists.
