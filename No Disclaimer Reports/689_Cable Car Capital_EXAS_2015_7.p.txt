Reconsideration Update 
This entry was posted in All Ideas  and tagged advocacy EXAS  on August 26, 2015.


Disclosure: Short EXAS


As promised in my previous post, you may now download Cable Car‚Äôs public comment in response to
statements made at the Public Meeting in July. Comments are normally available only through a FOIA
request, but in the interest of transparency I wanted to share my views more broadly. I believe Kevin
Conroy made several statements at the Public Meeting that are not accurate and deserve a public
accounting. The comment letter discusses the legal basis for the reconsideration request, claims
regarding compliance and cost-effectiveness, and additional cost analyses. Exact Sciences
shareholders can take comfort in the fact that the company has impressive operating leverage,
irrespective of the Medicare payment rate. The incremental cost per test in recent months appears to
be less than $100.


Following the preliminary determination on the reconsideration request expected sometime in
September, there will be an additional 30-day comment period before the 2016 fee schedule is
finalized.


CMS Panel


This morning, CMS convened the first meeting of an advisory panel on Clinical Laboratory Diagnostic
Tests. Steve Phurrough, the CMS Medical Officer who asked Conroy several questions at the Public
Meeting that are addressed in my letter, chairs the panel but is not a voting member.


The panel was established under the Protecting Access to Medicare Act (PAMA), which is also
changing the rate-setting process for the clinical lab fee schedule beginning in 2017. Since the PAMA
rulemaking is not yet complete, the purpose of this initial meeting was to provide input into the new
codes for 2016 that were discussed at the Public Meeting in July. The panel‚Äôs recommendations are
advisory and non-binding.

5/19/2018 Reconsideration Update | Cable Car Capital LLC


http://www.cablecarcapital.com/reconsideration-update/ 2/8


The bulk of today‚Äôs debate involved highly technical, controversial determinations regarding the most
comparable tests, from a methodological standpoint, to use for several new test codes. Cost-
effectiveness concerns were not mentioned at all.


Disappointingly, the panel‚Äôs brief discussion (starts at 1:26:30) of code G0464 resulted in an 11-0 vote,
with 1 abstention (likely the representative from the Mayo clinic) from the 12 panel members present,
in favor of maintaining the current crosswalk. More accurately, there was no discussion. The panel did
not discuss their reasoning at all; the only comment was from one individual who questioned why code
81315 had no connection to colon cancer and such a high reimbursement level before voting to
include it in the crosswalk anyway.


The panel members are all very well-respected scientific experts, but it does not appear that they
devoted much, if any, deliberation to the substance of the reconsideration request. In particular,
despite asking many clarifying questions regarding the most appropriate factors to consider for other
tests, in the case of G0464 there was no debate whatsoever about the appropriateness of considering
a test‚Äôs purpose, rather than its methodology, in assigning a crosswalk.


It is unclear whether or not the panel had the opportunity to review the reconsideration request in full
or the further comment letter. As the panel‚Äôs recommendation is non-binding, I strongly urge CMS to
take all available information into account in reaching its determination.

@cablecarcapital I respect the fact that you went there and voiced your opinion. But I don‚Äôt think CMS
is going to give them a hard time.

Out of all of the thousands of stocks to short, I am unable to understand
your ‚Äúobsession‚Äù with Exact Sciences. 


Your ‚Äúcrusade‚Äù against a Company that is going to save millions of lives is bizarre. 
Especially given their proven management team.


Successful traders and money managers are those that don‚Äôt let their ego get in the way. 
It‚Äôs pretty clear that your ego has gotten the best of you in this case. 
Hopefully you can learn from your lesson.

Again, there are thousands of stocks to short on the board. 
Tons of energy sector and mining companies laden with debt who are being crushed by
macro-global weakness. 
Why you are not short any names in those sectors is beyond me.

Thanks for reading, but this isn‚Äôt an obsession, a crusade, or even an unprofitable


investment. Cable Car has other short positions, and I‚Äôve written extensively


about my motivations for pursuing a policy outcome I believe is in the public interest.

Yes, I recall that you have been saying that you are now a consumer


‚Äúadvocate‚Äù who just happens to be a hedge-fund manager short shares of


EXAS. Never mind that 50,000 people a year die from colon cancer using current screening


methodologies. 


Leave it to you to push a test (FOBT) that literally requires you to have colon cancer before


being detected, since 


most Stage 1 and Stage 2 colon cancer doesn‚Äôt bleed.


I also recall that you have been short shares of EXAS since at least Q2-2014, before FDA


approval, when the shares sold in the $11 ‚Äì $17 range. That is what your performance letter


of your top ten holdings has shown. Small hedge fund shops like Cable Car, Voss Capital,


and the research analyst Aaron Fletcher who is a professor at Dallas Lutheran have been


terribly wrong about the prospects for EXAS. They have been on the wrong side of this


‚Äútrade‚Äù. And your trying to tell everyone that you are a consumer ‚Äúadvocate‚Äù?


Really Jacob?

Jack, the weighting of EXAS in the portfolio has varied significantly


over time.


As I have noted many times, I support Cologuard‚Äôs inclusion in the menu of screening


alternatives. Screening colonoscopies and annual FIT tests (with confirmatory


colonoscopy) are among the most cost-effective methods of reducing CRC mortality. I

‚Üê Is your high water mark net or gross of fees? Healthcare Cost Inflation ‚Üí


would like to see Cologuard priced at a level where it would also be cost-effective.


That is a goal shared by many people who are not members of the investment


community.
