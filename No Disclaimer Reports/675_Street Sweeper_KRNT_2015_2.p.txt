Kornit Digital: Recent Event Accelerates Risks

Summary


The recent acquisition of a top competitor poses several negative implications for
Kornit Digital, just as it attempts a critical expansion into a new market for Kornit,
called roll-to-roll.


Electronics for Imaging's acquisition of Reggiani pressures Kornit and other inkjet
printer companies due to the additional cash, R&D and expanded distribution
channels available to the new EFI Reggiani.


EFI has shown it wants to pay only 1.8X revenue and 7-12X EBITDA. At that rate,
Kornit might be acquisition-worthy at $1.88 to $4.26 per share, well below today's
~$14.


TheStreetSweeper alerts investors to the latest negative event subsequent to our recent
report on the massive risks facing Kornit Digital (NASDAQ:KRNT) - an event that suggests
the stock should be trading below $5 per share.


A top competitor, Italy-based Reggiani has been acquired by Electronics for Imaging for
about $84.2 million, plus ~$56.2 million over 30 months of milestone achievements.


The deal presents a couple of negative implications for Israeli inkjet printing company,
Kornit. These are particularly worrisome just as the company tries to make the critical
expansion from the T-shirt makers' market into the roll-to-roll market. Roll-to-roll printers
allow images to be printed on fabrics that are then sewn into garments, wallpaper,
furniture coverings, etc.


First, Reggiani, already a top rival whose sales jumped 61 percent between 2012 and
2013 to ~$76 million, will likely become a roll-to-roll gorilla.


The acquisition by Electronics for Imaging (NASDAQ:EFII) means the rebranded EFI
Reggiani will be able to use the money and advanced distribution channels afforded by
EFII. So it can be expected to negatively impact Kornit's future potential - as Kornit tries to
get its commercial roll-to-roll printer launched over about 18 months.


Second, this deal should have a downward effect on Kornit's valuation today.
