Vital Therapies' Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device has consistently failed every
clinical study it was tested in, including the recent VTI-208 Phase 3 study.


In two of Vital’s latest studies (VTI-206 and VTI-208), placebo patients out-survived
ELAD treated patients.


Nevertheless, the company's management decided to spend their investors' funds
on yet another attempt, based on post-hoc analysis of extremely cherry picked
data.


The FDA has already expressed doubt about ELAD in the past, emphasizing lack
of clinical evidence, and it is possible the agency will reject the proposed new
study.

The full article is available at the Phase 4 research website.


If the biotech industry were a stand-up comedy show, Vital Therapies (VTL) would steal
the limelight. The company has spent the past 20 years proving with the most reliable
statistical significance possible that its Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device (ELAD)
definitely does not work. But it turns out that there is still one remaining super
exclusively narrow patient subset in which ELAD has not yet been demonstrated to not
work. Vital is about to start proving this by YE2015.


Vital is due to submit information to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
around December 2015 regarding the registration of yet another ELAD clinical trial
based on post-hoc analysis of extremely cherry picked data from its recently failed VTI-
208 study. As will be demonstrated later in this report, the statistical significance VTL
eventually found in a tiny patient subset was the result of the elimination of 143 patients,
and took a month of frantic searching by the company. Ultimately, the scavenged
statistical significance appears to derive from sicker placebo patients, rather than
improving patients receiving ELAD treatment.


While it is certain that VTL's future trial will fail just like all its predecessors, it isn't a
certainty at all that the FDA will turn a blind eye to VTL's post-hoc malarkey and
allow the company to run another trial. "A hazard ratio of 1.027 (slightly favoring
the control group) with a log rank p-value of 0.90 (not statistically significant)" (fig. 1)
was the general gist of the company's latest trial outcome PR. In what has become
routine in VTL's trials, placebo patients actually out-survived ELAD patients in VTI-208,
and in VTI-206, half of the placebo patients outlived the ELAD patients nearly three-
fold.


Based on this, it is indeed questionable how allowing Vital to perform more trials would
be ethical, particularly as the FDA has already expressed doubt about ELAD in the past,
"The FDA has noted its view that preliminary clinical evidence…does not indicate that
the ELAD System may demonstrate a substantial improvement over the current
standard of care."


We have submitted an inquiry to the FDA regarding ELAD, bringing continuous out-
survival of the placebo patients in ELAD trials to the agency's attention. Response is
currently pending.

So what is the source of Vital's macabre inspiration to fail again?


This is a very important question for a company whose clinical trial success rate is an
official 0.000001% (Table 1).

After confirming our predictions about the utter failure of both primary and secondary
endpoints of ELAD's VTI-208 trial for patients with alcohol-induced liver decompensation
(AILD) just five minutes after August 21, 2015 options expiry, we were hopeful that
investors would finally be spared from this grotesque stock. But alas, rising from the
ashes of bankruptcy and failure for the sixth time like a horrible hepatocellular Cyclops,
VTL is once again threatening to prove that you can live longer with liver failure, so long
as you do not receive Vital Therapies' Extracorporeal Liver Assist Device therapy.


A month after announcing failure number six, along with the termination of two ongoing
trials (VTI-212 and VTI-210) and the firing of 30% of its workforce, Vital announced that
what remains of its ~$60 million cash position will be used to sponsor failure number 7,
which the company titled trial VTI-308. Oh, and the company would need additional
cash for this to materialize, which will be raised via a secondary offering of $30 million
priced at $5.50 a share, announced on Oct 22.

Frankly, if we were VTL investors, we would much rather keep the cash and advise
Vital's management to check out this website.


Never-ending Post-hoc


The premise behind VTI-308 is nothing short of an inverse post-hoc Ponzi scheme (fig.
2): the trial is based on results which the company cherry-picked in 60 out of 203
patients in trial VTI-208. In turn, trial VTI-208 was based on the premise that 8 out of 37
patients who failed to improve in trial VTI-206 showed a "weak trend towards statistical
significance," while trial VTI-206 was in turn based on meta-analysis of patient subsets
from failed trials in Alcoholic hepatitis, Acute liver failure, Chronic Liver Failure,
Fulminant hepatic failure - and the list goes on.


Throughout the formation of this disaster pyramid, Vital had to get very creative with the
naming of subsets of patients they imagined responded to ELAD. In VTI-208, the
company settled for "Alcohol-Induced Liver Decompensation (AILD)," which is an
obscure medical term the company used to describe liver disease caused by recent
ingestion of alcohol by patients with underlying liver disease, or, more specifically, the
disease of not really related patients who responded less strongly to placebo in VTI-206.
We shudder at the thought of what title the ailment of the healthy, young recently
ingested alcohol liver disease patient subset will receive in VTI-308. Just imagine the
label on that package.

It is important to keep in mind that with every subsequent trial Vital runs after a post-hoc
analysis, ELAD's addressable market shrinks painfully. It is not impossible to envision
that, by trial VTI-2999, ELAD might finally reach the market for the treatment of exactly
one patient. That patient also better have the best insurance he can get to cover the
$150,000 - $275,000 they will need for one course of treatment.


The very basis of ELAD is wrong

The main point of extracorporeal liver dialysis is to filter the patients' blood while the liver
is unable to do so, allowing the liver to regenerate. We have shown before that the best
proof that ELAD simply doesn't work is in the fact that this device does not diminish
any blood toxins at any meaningful rate. Whatever effect VTL thinks ELAD has on
blood toxins and other parameters doesn't even come close to effects of a simple non-
biological dialysis device, which is 10-15 times less costly and cumbersome than ELAD.


VTI-208 was the first large-scale trial that VTL actually completed without early
termination. It was a Phase 3 randomized, controlled, open-label trial in 203 subjects
with AILD. The primary endpoint was overall survival through at least 91 days, and the
secondary endpoint was the proportion of survivors at study days 28 and 91. The trial
enrolled 96 subjects randomized to the treatment group and 107 randomized to the
control group.


The trial failed everything it could: "A hazard ratio of 1.027 (slightly favoring the
control group) with a log rank p-value of 0.90 (not statistically significant, N.S.) indicated
that there was no difference between treated and control subjects in the primary
endpoint. The secondary endpoints of proportion of survivors at study days 28 and 91
also showed no difference between the groups (p-values of 0.45 (N.S.) and 0.74 (N.S.),
respectively)."


In fact, study VTI-208 showed that placebo caused less livers to fail than ELAD - 9.3%
of patients in the control group had hepatic failure, versus 13.7% in the ELAD arm
(Table 2). The same is true for hepatic encephalopathy - which results from…
accumulation of those toxins ELAD was supposed to be filtering from the patient's blood.

It is important to remember that the ELAD trials VTL runs are open-label, because ELAD
patients are receiving dialysis while control patients are receiving standard of care, such
as steroid and anti-cytokine therapy, without dialysis. Dialysis is invasive, it runs the risk
of "leaking" various nutrients and sodium out of the patients' blood, and can actually
cause damage if it is not contributing to improvement. While it is certain that ELAD does
not help patients, it could be argued that this hepatic carcinoma filter device may
actually be making them worse.


Does ELAD stand a chance of ever succeeding?


If it looks like a failure and walks like a failure… the answer is NO.


When Vital went on to show yet another post-hoc analysis in the announcement of their
atrocious VTI-208 results, it must have seemed to most like a horrible joke. An even
more embarrassing fact for VTL is that their frantic search for statistical significance is
actually documented in the sequence of their flabbergasting press releases, like a true
post-hoc-ception:


Aug 21, 2015: the company announces failure of VTI-208 and provides the following
post-hoc analysis:

1. Initially, the company eliminates 83 patients based on MELD score - no stat.
sig.:


In 120 subjects with a MELD score of < 28: overall survival approached statistical
significance with a hazard ratio of 0.575 and a log-rank p-value of 0.077 (the >28 MELD
subgroup's placebo patients performed better than ELAD)


22. The company eliminates another 4 subjects - still no stat. sig.:


"In the per protocol population for this subset (N = 116), the p-value was 0.059
(N.S.). Furthermore, an analysis of 91-day survival in the ITT cohort revealed ELAD
survival of 80.4% versus control survival of 65.2% (p=0.068, (N.S.)). "


3. In another subset, 102 patients are gone in an age-based elimination - no stat
sig. of course:


In another pre-specified exploratory analysis of the 101 subject sub-group with age
less than the median age of 46.9 years, a Kaplan-Meier analysis of overall survival
showed a hazard ratio of 0.634 with a log-rank p-value of 0.167 (N.S.)


Sep 28, 2015: VTL announces trial VTI-308 and post-hoc subset number is now 71 (132
patients lost) - finally stat sig (just)! :


"A post hoc analysis of VTI-208, which serves as the basis for design of our
preliminary VTL-308 protocol, excludes subjects 50 years and older and also those
with creatinine 1.3 mg/dL and above and INR above 2.5, in an attempt to avoid
subjects with significant kidney and blood clotting dysfunction. In accord with this
analysis, the 91-day survival rates were 93.9% for ELAD-treated subjects and 68.4%
for controls (N=71; P < 0.05)."


Oct 16, 2015 - VTL's 8-K: post-hoc subset number is now 60 (143 patients lost) - even
more stat sig!:


Post Hoc VTI-208 Subset: age <50 years, MELD <30 and specific restrictions on MELD
components (Creatinine < 1.3 mg/dL, INR ≤ 2.5, Bilirubin ≥ 16 mg/dL). Overall survival
up to at least study day 91 (N=60; p<0.01.)

91-day survival in this post hoc analysis was 93% for the ELAD group versus 61% for
those treated only with standard of care (Pearson's Chi-squared p<0.01). Moreover, the
survival benefit appeared durable with survival at the end of 180 days of 89% for the
ELAD group versus 48% in those treated only with standard of care (Pearson's Chi-
squared p<0.01).


Notice that the survival of ELAD-treated patients has not really changed between Sept.
28 and Oct 16, but placebo patients got sicker - so we know that the source of all that
statistical significance is not really ELAD. It is highly likely that VTL simply got lucky that
some dozen below-50, certain-MELD and -INR score placebo patients in its failed trial
were sicker than the equivalent ELAD-arm patients.


Of the ~30 patients in each arm of Vital's post-post-post-hoc 60-patient group, VTI-308
is hanging on the hopes of statistical significance from a 10-patient difference in a
203-patient trial. It's all terribly un-scientific.


VTI-308: the protocol & serious issues


Vital now plans to run a 150-patient trial based on those very same exclusive
parameters, which took a month to scavenge from VTI-208's data. The company plans
to begin opening clinical sites in Q4 2015, and to start enrolling patients in the first half
of 2016. For this, VTL has submitted a briefing document including a draft trial protocol
to the FDA for the upcoming Type C written response meeting, from which VTL expects
feedback by YE2015.


The proposed eligibility criteria are:


"The proposed design excludes subjects aged 50 years or older and those with a
MELD of 30 or higher. Considering the three components of MELD, subjects are also
excluded with creatinine of 1.3 mg/dL or above, which limits kidney dysfunction, and
international normalized ratio (INR) above 2.5, which limits blood coagulopathy. The
third MELD component, bilirubin, has been raised to a minimum of 16 mg/dL to
ensure that liver dysfunction is a major contributor to MELD."

It isn't yet clear what indication VTL intends to pursue in VTL-308, and whether it will be
AILD or whether the company will concoct another convoluted disease name. It is also
highly uncertain that the FDA will actually allow the company to run another trial.
In addition to the fact that ELAD has been shown to be less effective than placebo in
VTI-208, and the fact that the agency expressed doubts about the efficacy of ELAD in
the past, it has also raised issues with the open-label set-up of VTL's trials: "The FDA
has expressed concern that the VTI-208 study may not be adequately designed to
provide convincing evidence of efficacy if there are significant differences in how the
ELAD System subjects and controls are treated during the treatment period and after
hospital discharge."


Obviously, there are other issues with the trial setup of VTI-308. An obvious one is that
the average age of people with liver disease is way over 50. The under-50 liver disease
patient subset, even in VTL's lucid dreams of an effective ELAD, would be a patient
niche that would generate hardly any revenue for the company, considering ELAD's
price is an insane $150,000-275,000 for one course of treatment. In an environment
where drug pricing is heavily discussed, a device that is less effective than a cheap
alternative (like the MARS device) just doesn't stand a chance of surviving.
