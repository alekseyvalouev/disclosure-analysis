asensio.com to release critique of Universal
Display’s invalid “beat and raise” and denials of
near-term sudden death risk.


Posted on November 11, 2013 by asensio.com


Last Friday, the publicly traded shares of Universal Display Corp.’s


common stock (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) experienced an undeserved


and counterintuitive 25% one-day increase after UDC announced a


supposed “beat and raise.” UDC perpetrated its scheme, the


supposed “beat and raise,” exactly as Goldman Sachs and others,


including asensio.com, had long-ago advised. Tomorrow


asensio.com will be issuing a detailed report to address UDC’s


material misrepresentations that, in the words of one of their


analysts, “frustrated” investors’ ability to properly value the shares


and UDC’s attempts to distract from sustained negative financial


results, along with UDC’s distorted presentation of recent adverse


patent litigation decisions.


The more important issue is UDC’s denial of the materiality of the


upcoming trial on what UDC is now describing as its “early


fundamental phosphorescent OLED inventions,” which is scheduled


within days, on November 20th and 21st. UDC’s conduct seems to be


aimed at purposefully cultivating a belief among analysts that this


pending decision cannot have a material negative outcome on


UDC’s ability to collect semi-annual payments from Samsung or to


obtain new business. 


UDC’s so-called “beat and raise” was totally invalid. UDC’s Q3 results


were actually below the expectations of informed observers. UDC’s


results were below those implied by the growth in OLED mobile


display shipments in the quarter. They were not a beat, but a miss.


Furthermore, UDC is anticipating a drop in materials sales in Q4,


despite continued display shipment growth. UDC’s red emitter sales


continue to experience year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter


declines.

Again, in our view, we consider UDC’s continuing efforts to avoid


openly addressing the potential “sudden death” impact of the


hearing later this month on UDC’s most crucial patent claims, while


continuing to distort the meaning of other also significant adverse


patent decisions, to be more serious than its preposterous “beat and


raise.”
