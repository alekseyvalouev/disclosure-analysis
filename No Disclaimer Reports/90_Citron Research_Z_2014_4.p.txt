Zillow (Nasdaq:Z) Gives Away Potentially Most 
Lucrative Market ... for FREE?? 


 
How Can You Win At Monopoly when you Give Away 


Boardwalk for Free? 
 
The stock market is a funny place; sometimes you can be right and wrong at the same 
time.  Over the past two years, Citron Research has been critical of Zillow’s business 
model.  Zillow's financial performance has repeatedly proven us right -- generating 
topline and bottom line misses and downward revisions.  Yet the stock price has 
proven us wrong: 40 to 140 in 18 months!

Citron could write 100 pages on the irreconcilable structural flaws in ZIllow’s business 
model- past, present, and future, which are directly responsible for the earnings 
disappointments. But the company just delivered the message on a silver platter in one 
simple press release: 
 


Zillow and Douglas Elliman Real Estate Company 
Launch Strategic Marketing Partnership 





http://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20140624-909960.html 
 
This week's release said it all.  When we read about the partnership between Zillow and 
Douglas Elliman, the largest name in New York City real estate, a release that discloses 
no financial details, we couldn’t believe our eyes.  Did Zillow just give away the keys to 
its most potentially lucrative market in the entire United States … for free?  
 


The press release says Douglas Elliman is Zillow’s marketing partner.  Elliman 
shouldn’t be Zillow’s marketing partner- they should be Zillow's 
customer… Not just any customer, one of its largest customers! 
 
So much for the mythical metric “eyeballs” on Real Estate listings … or 2018 EBIDTA … or 
any other nonsense metric Wall Street is hooked on besides profitability.  All you need 
to know is this:  
 
Starting this week Zillow has just given Douglas Elliman featured listing status for its 
9,000 listings, anointing its agents with the special branding opportunity normally 
reserved for its highest paying Real Estate Agent / customers.   
 
With this agreement, all Elliman property listings now appear as “featured listings”, 
displayed on top of all Zillow's search results in NY City.  The Zillow website and app will 
become a default advertisement for Douglas Elliman.  And specifically, with the 
“featured listing” designation for all those listings, they become unavailable as 
inventory for display ad sales for other brokers, thereby basically giving away the most 
valuable piece of inventory they own.

Further, Zillow now has completed the abandonment of the revenue stream its acquired 
StreetEasy.com used to generate. 
  





http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-12/zillow-drops-search-fees-for-nyc-listings-site-
streeteasy.html 





This is time management has to NOT: Tweet, Vine, Instagram, Facebook, or 
even Tinder its shareholders -- this is the time for old school disclosure.  
What were the financial terms behind this transaction?  When a publicly 
traded company touts a “partnership” with no financial terms, it’s almost 
always because they are immaterial. 
 


Why would Zillow Do Such a Thing? 
 


This deal completely deconstructs Zillow’s business model.  Zillow ought be most 
dominant in cities without a public-facing MLS system, because it provides something 
for which no other source exists.  That’s why StreetEasy could charge $10 per month or 
$100 per year.  New York City has always been the holy grail for a real estate listing 
service to exploit the lack of MLS in a competitive environment with high RE prices.  So 
what does Zillow do?  It gives i it away for free.   
 
What does this mean to the value of its offerings for Realtors in cities with a public 
facing MLS, like Los Angeles, Chicago, and Houston?  
 


It is all about the listings.   
 
The highlights the unique flaw in Zillow's business:  its customers are also its content 
providers, which leaves it operating within a culture of irreconcilable conflict. 
 
Zillow’s Achilles Heel has always been that it does not own its content (the listings) -- it 
is utterly dependent on broker cooperation and participation in order to have accurate 
content (the listings) to display.  In the U.S., unlike other countries, real estate listings 


Most everyone knows about Zillow’s acquisition of the popular New York City 
website StreetEasy.  When StreetEasy was acquired by Zillow they used to 
charge $10 a month or $100 a year for subscription for real estate search 
tools.  In February of this year Zillow went free with StreetEasy saying "Today’s 
move is part of a redesign that makes more space for “featured listing” 
advertisements purchased by developers and brokers”  And than what do they 
do…they give away the featured listings to their potential biggest 
customer.  No subscription fees no featured listing fees.

are just a commodity that can be found all over – it is a fragmented market.  This 
weakness was highlighted in a recent Forbes article that explains that listing agents have 
the upper hand in the relationship.

Since day one, Zillow’s unresolved flaw in its business model is the proposition of forcing 
Real Estate agents and brokers to spend their advertising dollars to get leads from their 
own listings.  With this deal, Zillow irrefutably demonstrates the major headwind this 
problem really represents.  This practice has never been fair to the consumer or the 
broker.  The Douglas Elliman deal demonstrates conclusively that the power of the 
listing outweighs the power of the web traffic. 
 
Without Zillow, Douglas Elliman would sell the same amount of Real Estate in New 
York.  But without Douglas Elliman, Zillow would be irrelevant in New York.  
 
Zillow needed to get Elliman in its listing system in order to preserve the relevance and 
credibility of its NYC listings.  The lack of accuracy in its listings is so evident that one of 
its competitors, www.realtor.com, has dedicated its entire marketing message to 
criticize Zillow’s obvious weak point:  accuracy of listings. (Funny commercials)

Why Zillow Does Not Want Investors or Any Other Brokerage Firms to 
Know About the Details of the Douglas Elliman Deal 
 
Here is some simple analysis.  Let’s look at 2 zip codes in New York starting with real 
estate hotbed SOHO -- 10013:    http://www.zillow.com/homes/10013_rb/ 
 


“Zillow not only offers property listings without charge but also 
prominently names the agent marketing the property,”  


--Benjamin Edelman, Harvard Business Review 


“Listing Agencies Have the Upper Hand,”  
--Panos Mourdoukoutas, Forbes

The first thing you will notice when going to “newest” is that every Douglas Elliman 
listing is 4 days old, despite how long they have really been on the market.  But who 
really cares about honesty when you are running a business? Most importantly, notice 
that by being anointed “featured listings”, Zillow restricts competing broker 
advertisements around those listings. 
 
Compare a Featured Listing with just one broker to a “non-featured” one, which shows 
multiple broker ads competing on another broker’s listing: 
http://www.zillow.com/homedetails/138-Mulberry-St-3A-New-York-NY-
10013/2106350451_zpid/ 
 
And what would a summertime analysis be without the Hamptons?  The same goes for 
East Hampton – 
 
http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/Suffolk-County-
NY/list/2046_rid/days_sort/40.97717,-72.34218,40.843786,-72.485249_rect/6_p/ 
 
What is important here is this demonstrates the dismantling of the Zillow core business 
model of selling leads to brokers around other people’s listings. More importantly it 
shows that Zillow’s traffic was not enough to make Elliman want to pay any significant 
sums of money for this deal.  The reality of this deal will impact the pricing power of 
Zillow going forward in major markets.   
 
We can’t stress this enough: 
 
Without Zillow, Douglas Elliman would sell the same amount of Real Estate in New 
York.  But without Douglas Elliman, Zillow would be irrelevant in New York.  
 


The fallout from this partnership could be devastating.  
 
Zillow now has passively telegraphed to all major brokerage firms in the US that if you 
withhold listings from Zillow, you too can get unique branding and featured listing status 
for your properties. 
 
Everything about this deal hurts the perceived value of the Zillow brand to all 
paying/advertising realtors/customers.  Principally, it highlights the disconnect between 
what Wall St. thinks Zillow is (a real estate behemoth) and what Zillow really is (a lead 
generation company that is nothing without listings). 
 


Zillow HAD to do this deal as recently as last week as the 
competitive landscape is shifting under their feet

Just last week the Real Estate Board Of New York (REBNY) decided to implement 
Internet Data Exchange (IDX) for their listings.  This is a broker-neutral platform that 
affords consumers easy access to view pooled listings on agent or broker websites.    


REBNY Votes to Implement Internet Data Exchange (IDX) As Part of Listing Service 


http://www.rebny.com/content/rebny/en/newsroom/press-releases/2014/idx_rls_vote.html 


 
This was a direct attack on Zillow, as brokers are positioning themselves to generate 
traffic on their own websites. 


 
http://www.inman.com/2014/06/20/idx-comes-to-new-york-rebny-votes-to-allow-brokers-
agents-to-display-pooled-listings/ 


 
Another harbinger of change in the NY Listings market:  
 





http://therealdeal.com/blog/2014/06/20/rebny-to-integrate-idx-into-its-listing-service/ 
 


Brokers would rather use the new IDX system to drive traffic to their own websites. 
 


Zillow is forced to cut as many deals for direct feeds from 
brokers as possible – in an attempt to preclude another Austin, 
Texas situation. 
 
In October 2013 The Austin Multiple Listing Service turned off its feed of listings to 
syndication sites like Zillow as of April 2014.  As of now, the only way Zillow gets a listing 
in Austin is if the broker opts to upload it themselves. 
 
http://www.inman.com/2013/10/30/8-more-austin-real-estate-brokerages-turn-off-
flow-of-listings-to-portals/ 
 


Kathy Braddock, Purcell’s fellow managing director at William Raveis, 
also cited the rise of StreetEasy, which was bought by Zillow last year 
for $50 million, as the key factor in REBNY’s decision to adopt IDX. 
Allowing the general public to skip that step brings REBNY’s RLS 
system in line with Zillow and StreetEasy, which do not require users 
to log in to browse listings.

As of the date of this report there are currently 10,100 properties displayed for sale on 
the official MLS of Austin: 
http://www.austinhomesearch.com/Listing/ListingSearch.aspx 
 
Yet, if you go to Zillow and search Austin, Texas you only see results for 2,568 


properties:  http://www.zillow.com/homes/  That’s scarcely 25% of the listings in 
Austin!  
 


Pricing Power?  Look Down Under 


The rationale behind Zillow’s recent price strength in the stock is partially due to 
management’s having convinced analysts that they are gaining increasing “pricing 
power”  -- the ability to raise advertising rates in the near future.   


The empty rhetoric of this promise is laid bare by the Douglas Elliman deal.   Wall Street 
will soon realize that the consumer regards Real Estate listings as a commodity, like a 
stock quote. Having spent hundreds of millions on wave after wave of consumer 
advertising, Zillow still only controls 17% of the real estate traffic in the US and is far 
from being a controlling force.  


Investors must consider Australia and the recent 20% pullback in the REA group.  Real 
Estate agents in Australia have pushed back against price increases on a site that 
controls 67% of the real estate traffic there and have gone as far as launching a broker 
owned portal of their own. 


Broker-owned portal to launch in Australia 


http://www.inman.com/wire/broker-owned-portal-to-launch-in-


australia/?utm_source=20140625&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=dailyheadlinesam#.U61vHfldUwD 


It is Citron’s firmly held opinion that broker indifference to Zillow as a lead-generation 
tool, plus what we are seeing in New York and other markets worldwide is the “tell” of a 
coming correction in Zillow’s vulnerable business model. 


These links are must-read if you invest in this space.  If anyone thought the U.S Real 
Estate market was going to become a model like Australia’s, now we see that Australia is 
more likely to become the U.S. when it comes to brokers taking control of their own 
listings!

Any recent news on how brokers feel about Zillow?   
Is it a “Must Have”? 
 


JUST THIS WEEK Inman news reported the results of survey responses from nearly 1,300 
randomly selected real estate agents … and it was not at all favorable to Zillow. 
 


 
http://www.inman.com/2014/06/25/realtors-want-more-technology-from-brokers-and-mlss/ 





Here is the study result as published.  Again, this report was issued just this week:

When asked to pick the single best marketing software or 
website to generate new leads, 22 percent cited their company 
website, followed by their personal website (15 percent), “other” 
(14 percent), realtor.com (13 percent), Facebook (10 percent), 
Zillow (9 percent) and Trulia (6 percent).

This survey clearly demonstrates non-differentiation of product, with even 
Realtor.com (with a market cap 1/10


th
 of Zillow’s) preferred by a 3:2 margin.  More 


importantly it shows the importance of individual websites:  real estate, unlike travel, 
has always been, and will always be, a people business. 
 
 


Conclusion 
 


At the beginning of 2013, you could invest in Zillow at $28, for a share for a company 
that was supposed to generate $65 mil in EBIDTA in 2014.   
 
Today you are paying $140 a share for what analysts now project to be $50 mil in 
EBIDTA.  All this for a company that does not really know what it is and whose 
business model is constantly under attack not only from its competition -- but from its 
own customers. 
 


For this, investors are paying 20x revenues and a 142 P/E on forward 
earnings?   Good luck with that!  
 


Caveat emptor. 
 


   Cautious Investing to All  
 


*  Spencer Rascoff 
In past writings, Citron has been critical of Zillow CEO Spence Rascoff.  We’ve gone as far 


as to lampoon him on the site – and for this we apologize.  If we were starting a public 


company tomorrow we would hire a top notch COO and make Rascoff the CEO.  It is 


impossible to look at the stock chart of Zillow and not attribute it to the tireless 


interviews, tweets, and social media enthusiasm that Rascoff exudes every time he 


opens his mouth.   





Considering the company has consistently missed bottom line estimates for three years, 


we give him a C- as an operator.  Because Wall Street doesn’t care, and instead has been 


mesmerized by Rascoff’s enthusiastic misdirection of focus toward “eyeballs” and away 


from a profitable business model, we give him an A+; he’s a true master of the Jedi Mind 


Trick.
