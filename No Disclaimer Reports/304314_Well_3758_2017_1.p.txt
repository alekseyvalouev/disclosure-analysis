Aeria	(3758):		
Floating	on	Unreal	Numbers	











The	Crux:	
	
Aeria	has	just	one	mobile	game	hit,	but	independent	
industry	trackers	show	that	download	numbers	for	
that	game	are	significantly	lower	than	the	statistics	
the	Co.	has	showed	in	its	many	releases	on	the	topic.	
Outside	the	game,	the	Co.	has	no	new	hit	games	on	the	horizon	and	a	track	record	of	failed	M&A	activity	
for	the	last	three	years.	What’s	worse,	the	M&A	was	mostly	funded	through	stock	and	warrants	and	Co.	
shareholders	now	likely	face	dilution.	The	Co.	seems	like	it	needs	to	constantly	to	have	its	stock	pumped	
up,	but	earnings	and	cash	flow	are	weak	with	no	trigger	for	improvement.	Recently,	the	Co.	downgraded	
its	auditor	to	a	tiny	firm	with	a	track	record	of	auditing	clients	fined	by	financial	authorities	for	improper	
activity.	We	value	Aeria	at	¥465	per	share	which	implies	a	downside	of	over	70%.

REPORT	SUMMARY	
	
Aeria	has	been	on	a	buying	spree	since	the	end	of	FY2014,	today	it	is	an	amalgamation	of	independently	
operated	 IT,	online	gaming	and	real	estate	service	businesses	 that	have	been	predominantly	acquired	
over	the	past	three	years.			
	
One	of	the	many	deals	it	made	was	for	smart-phone	game	developer	Liber	Entertainment	in	April	2015.		
In	January	2017,	Liber	released	a	new	smart-phone	game	called	A3!	and	Aeria’s	stock	has	jumped	more	
than	185%	off	the	back	of	the	game’s	apparent	success.			
	
Given	Aeria’s	 lack	 of	 cash	 flow	over	 the	period,	 it	 has	 relied	upon	 all-stock	 acquisitions	 to	 pay	 for	 its	
acquisition	binge	 in	an	attempt	 to	create	earnings.	We	believe	 the	Company’s	over-reliance	on	stock-
acquisitions	and	ongoing	absence	of	a	sustainable	earnings	model	means	Aeria	is	highly	incentivized	to	
ensure	its	stock	trades	as	high	as	possible.	As	a	result,	we	believe	Aeria	oversteps	the	lines	of	acceptable	
promotion	to	misleading	disclosure	to	investors.	
	
We	value	Aeria	at	¥465	per	share	which	implies	a	downside	of	over	70%.	We	believe:	
	


- Aeria	has	released	misleading	download	data	for	A3!	that	overstates	actual	downloads	by	over	
400%.	 The	 company	 claims	 over	 4	 million	 downloads	 for	 A3!,	 but	 multiple	 third-party	 data	
providers	show	just	over	821,000	unique	downloads	to	the	end	of	Sept.	


- Aeria	is	further	misleading	investors	by	claiming	A3!	is	growing	strongly	with	over	500,000	new	
downloads	just	from	July	to	August.	However,	the	same	independent	third-party	data	shows	A3!	
has	only	added	approx.	45,000	new	unique	downloads	


- A3!	is	clearly	not	as	popular	or	growing	as	fast	as	Aeria	appears	to	suggest,	consequently	we	think	
revenue	and	profit	from	A3!	(the	main	source	of	earnings	for	Aeria)	are	likely	to	fall	off	a	cliff	


- We	have	concerns	over	 the	reliability	of	Aeria’s	accounts	after	 it	downgraded	 its	auditor	 from	
ShinNihon	EY,	a	Big	Four	firm,	to	small	accounting	firm	Avantia.	Moreover,	Aeria	has	stated	that	
there	was	a	lack	of	adequate	internal	financial	controls	and	reporting	regarding	the	acquisition	of	
companies	that	have	driven	its	apparent	growth.	


- Poor	Acquisitions.	Aeria	has	been	a	serial	acquirer	since	the	end	of	FY2014,	yet	these	purchases	
have	 had	minimal	 impact	 on	 its	 bottom	 line.	 Indeed,	 Aeria	 took	 an	 unusually	 large	 goodwill	
amortization	hit	on	the	first	wave	of	these	acquisitions	just	one	year	later	in	FY2016.	In	fact,	closer	
analysis	of	Aeria’s	parent	accounts	show	this	was	essentially	an	impairment	charge	on	these	deals.	
We	think	this	demonstrates	that	Aeria	was	aware	these	acquired	businesses	were	worth	far	less	
than	 they	 paid.	 Investors	 need	 to	 review	 the	 disclosure	 of	 its	 write-downs	 in	 its	 financial	
statements	and	ignore	the	hype	the	company	spins.			


- Dilution	 is	 coming.	 Aeria	 has	 paid	 for	 its	 numerous	 acquisitions	with	 stock	 and	warrants.	We	
expect	the	warrants	could	well	dilute	shareholders	by	at	least	16.3%
3	
	


VALUATION	
	
We	believe	that	the	revenue	and	profits	from	A3!	will	sharply	decline	in	the	near	future	given	the	game	is	
not	nearly	as	popular	as	promoted.	We	think	A3!	has	already	moved	past	“peak	earnings”	and	the	steeper	
part	 of	 its	 earnings	 decline	 has	 begun.	 The	 rest	 of	 Aeria’s	 business	 consists	 of	 a	 series	 of	 random	
acquisitions	with	no	discernible	synergies	and	the	Company	has	been	loss	making	in	most	years.	As	such	
we	believe	these	acquisitions	to	be	of	no	value.	Aeria’s	only	two	previous	games	of	note	were	Klee	and	I-
chu,	yet	these	are	ancient	history	and	cannot	provide	any	earnings	support.	For	the	two	years	prior	to	
A3!’s	release,	the	online	content	business	only	produced	losses	for	the	Company.	 	A3!	 is	thus	the	only	
asset	of	any	value	and	we	calculate	this	to	be	worth	¥10.2	billion	at	most;	this	amounts	to	a	share	price	
for	Aeria	of	¥465	per	share	which	implies	a	downside	of	over	70%.

AERIA	IS	MISLEADING	INVESTORS	OVER	DOWNLOADS	AND	GROWTH	
	
A3!	Downloads	are	80%	lower	than	Aeria	claims	
	
At	the	end	of	January	2017,	Aeria’s	subsidiary	(Liber	Entertainment)	released	A3!,	a	simulation	game	that	
revolves	around	creating	a	boy-band.	Liber’s	previous	game	I-chu	(アイチュウ) was	underwhelming	and	
did	not	help	Aeria	hit	profitability,	but	A3!	has	been	comparatively	much	more	successful...	unfortunately	
though	that	success	is	just	not	as	great	as	Aeria	likes	to	claim.
5	
	


The	 hyperbole	 started	 on	 November	 4,	 2016,	when	 Aeria	 announced	 pre-registration	 figures	 of	 over	
100,000	and	rising	to	an	incredible	470,000	on	January	23,	2017.	
	


	
	
Aeria’s	inflammatory	tone	continued	when	they	launched	the	game.	As	can	be	seen	by	the	table	below,	
Aeria	continually	publishes	announcements	promoting	the	fast	growth	in	the	number	of	downloads.	In	
the	first	three	days,	Aeria	claims	to	have	had	over	800,000	downloads	and	just	a	couple	of	days	later	it	
had	surpassed	1	million	downloads.	Aeria	has	continued	to	make	announcements	every	time	downloads	
surpass	 another	 500,000-download	 milestone	 with	 its	 most	 recent	 announcement	 claiming	 to	 have	
broken	through	4	million	downloads	made	on	August	17,	2017:

Priori	Data	shows	a	total	821,172	downloads	until	September	2017	and	just	783,177	downloads	to	the

results	with	other	App	Analytics	companies	and	found	similar	results.	
	
Aeria	claims	to	have	over	800,000	downloads	in	the	first	three	days,	but	according	to	Priori	Data	they	did	
not	break	that	barrier	until	August	2017,	over	6	months	later!	In	fact,	Aeria	claims	that	there	were	over	1	
million	 downloads	 after	 just	 five	 days	 but	 based	 on	 third	 party	 data	 they	 are	 still	 under	 1	 million	
downloads	let	alone	the	over	4	million	claimed.	
	
In	short,	third-party	data	shows	that	A3!	downloads	are	80%	less	that	those	claimed	by	Aeria.

(1)	The	dates	of	Aeria	announcements	vary	and	as	such	we	have	just	lined	
up	each	announcement	with	a	corresponding	month.

Why	the	big	difference?		
	
App	Analytics	companies	define	downloads	as	one	per	account	holder,	they	do	this	to	correct	for	instances	
where	 one	 user	may	 have	 downloaded	 an	 app,	 deleted	 it	 and	 then	 reinstalled	 it.	 Unlike	many	 other	
developers,	Aeria	does	not	disclose	its	definition	of	the	“downloads”	it	announces.	However,	it	appears	
to	be	clearly	more	than	one	download	per	account.	We	believe	Aeria	are	counting	multiple	downloads	
per	account	as	users	attempt	to	arbitrage	in-game	bonuses	awarded	to	players	in	what	is	known	in	Japan	
as	a	rese-mara	or	“Marathon	Reset”.	This	occurs	when	users	install	the	game,	but	are	displeased	with	the	
bonus	in	the	starter	kit	they	receive,	delete	the	game,	and	re-download	the	app	numerous	times	until	
they	receive	bonuses	they	are	happy	with.	Whilst	many	companies	prevent	users	from	doing	this,	Aeria	
does	not	and	in	fact,	according	to	some	websites,	A3!	is	actually	among	the	smartphone	games	where	a	
rese-mara	strategy	works	best3.			
	





	
	
Aeria’s	claimed	growth	is	just	not	there	
	
It	is	not	just	that	Aeria	has	overstated	the	number	of	downloads,	they	also	imply	the	game	continues	to	
attract	a	large	amount	of	new	users	and	thus	A3!	will	remain	a	strong	contributor	of	profit	going	forward.	
However,	this	is	far	from	the	truth,	as	can	be	seen	from	the	graph	below,	the	actual	growth	profile	of	new	
unique	downloads	is	far	lower	than	those	announced	by	the	Company.

Moreover,	as	the	graph	below	shows,	the	number	of	new	monthly	users	is	dropping	considerably	implying	
future	profit	growth	is	highly	unlikely.	We	think	Aeria	may	be	incentivized	to	mislead	investors	in	order	to	
maintain	a	higher	 stock	price	as	 this	 is	 the	main	currency	 in	which	 they	have	 funded	 their	acquisition	
binge.

On	August	21,	20174,	Aeria	signed	a	license	agreement	with	bilibili5,	a	Chinese	company,	to	distribute	A3!	
in	 China,	 although	 the	 date	 of	 launch	 has	 yet	 to	 be	 decided.	 Before	 you	 get	 too	 excited,	 bilibili	 also	
distributed	 I-chu	which	 seems	 to	have	 failed	 to	help	Aeria	become	profitable.	 	We	believe	 this	 is	 just	
additional	promotion	by	management	to	try	push	up	the	stock	price. 
	
Upcoming	Games	
	
Aeria	has	recently	released	a	new	game,	“Soen	no	Kantai”,	a	game	based	on	the	board	game	“Battleships”	
but	as	we	expected	it	had	an	underwhelming	debut	and	has	only	had	40,000	downloads	since	its	launch	
at	the	beginning	of	September	2017.

Conclusion	
	
Aeria	has	misled	investors	regarding	the	popularity	of	A3!.	Based	on	the	slowdown	in	downloads	Aeria	
does	not	have	the	popularity	to	be	a	long	lasting	profit	generator.	As	can	be	seen	from	the	data	above,	
growth	 is	 slowing	 and	was	 never	 near	 the	 level	 that	Aeria	was	 claiming.	 As	 such	 investors	 should	 be	
extremely	cautious.		We	value	the	company	at	just	24%	of	the	current	share	price,	even	in	the	case	of	an	
optimistic	assumption	that	the	net	income	in	the	next	year	will	be	flat.

WE	CAN’T	TRUST	AERIA’S	ACCOUNTS	–	CAN	YOU?	
	
Red	Flag	#2	
	
Aeria	downgraded	their	auditor	from	ShinNihon	EY,	a	Big	Four	accounting	firm,	on	March	1,	20176,	to	a	
very	small	auditor	called	Avantia	(アヴァンティア)7.	This	move	to	a	small	firm	is	itself	a	red	flag.		
	
Red	Flag	#3	
	
The	track	record	of	Avantia’s	other	clients	raises	more	concerns	over	the	kind	of	companies	that	Avantia	
audits:	
	


- 2372	I’rom	Group		 -		fined	for	insider	trading	on	clinical	trial	results8	
- 3674	Aucfan	Co	 Ltd	 -	 	 had	 a	dispute	with	KPMG	over	 accounting	 and	 internal	 controls	 so	


changed	to	an	auditor	called	Aria	and	then,	just	six	weeks	later,	changed	to	Avantia9	
- 6656	Inspec		-	fined	for	market	manipulation10		
- 9704	Agora	Hospitality	Group	 -	 Fined	 by	 the	 FSA	 for	 filing	 false	 statements	 in	 201511	and	


become	an	Avantia	client	in	2017	
	
Red	Flag	#4	
	
We	find	it	highly	suspicious	that	after	no	acquisitions	in	FY	2016,	in	March	2017	Aeria	swapped	its	auditor	
from	a	respectable	Big	Four	firm	to	a	tiny	auditor	and	in	the	few	months	that	followed	undertook	a	large	
number	of	acquisitions.	Multiple	acquisitions	in	itself	is	another	red	flag	and	the	timing	looks	increasingly	
suspicious	so	soon	after	changing	from	a	large	to	a	small	audit	firm.		
	
	
Red	Flag	#5		
	
Aeria’s	accounts	are	littered	with	restatements,	but	of	particular	concern	for	such	an	acquisitive	company	
is	that	it	has	filed	notifications	with	regulators	for	the	past	two	financial	years12	that	its	internal	controls	
with	regards	to	financial	reporting	are	deficient.	
	
For	both	2015	and	2016	Aeria	notified	the	Kanto	Bureau	of	Finance	that	it	had	accounting	issues	relating	
to	the	allocation	of	M&A	acquisition	costs!	
	
We	find	it	hard	to	believe	that	anyone	can	confidently	trust	Aeria’s	accounts.

WORTHLESS	ACQUISITIONS	AND	QUICK	WRITEDOWNS	
	
At	the	very	end	of	FY2014,	the	company	embarked	on	an	acquisition	spree,	buying	six	companies	between	
November	2014	and	November	2015.	While	these	deals	helped	increase	revenue	the	company	remained	
unprofitable.	After	a	nearly	one	and	half	year	hiatus,	Aeria	has	begun	a	new	M&A	binge	since	April	2017	
and	has	acquired	another	ten	companies	by	end-September	2017	and	diversified	into	real-estate	services	
with	a	number	of	acquisitions	in	this	space!	
	
Aeria’s	acquisition	strategy	appears	to	be	like	buying	lottery	tickets	in	the	hope	of	eventually	generating	
sustainable	earnings.		
	


	
	
The	majority	of	these	acquisitions	were	completed	via	stock	swaps	and	we	believe	that	the	total	value	of	
the	acquisitions	made	was	approximately	¥8.3	billion,	with	additional	warrants	that	could	be	valued	up	to	
¥890	million14	if	the	stock	hits	certain	price	levels.		
	
We	believe	that	the	total	cost	of	acquisitions	made	during	FY2014	and	FY2015	alone	amounted	to	approx.	
¥3.6	billion.	Incredibly,	in	the	next	fiscal	year,	(Red	Flag	#6)	the	Company	took	a	suspiciously	large	goodwill	
amortization	charge	against	these	for	¥1.7	billion,	or	almost	50%	of	the	value	of	the	deals!		
	
In	Aeria’s	parent	accounts,	this	charge	is	labeled	as	a	loss	on	valuation	of	shares	of	subsidiaries,	which	we	
think	 indicates	 that	 this	 is	 merely	 an	 impairment	 charge	 and	 implies	 these	 acquisitions	 are	 far	 less	
profitable	than	expected	prior	to	the	acquisition.	This	means	that	a	number	of	these	acquisitions	failed	
very	 quickly	 and	 raises	 suspicion	 that	 the	 Aeria’s	 management	 are	 either	 performing	 minimal	 due	
diligence,	have	poor	deal	making	abilities	or	are	sampling	taking	a	scattergun	approach	in	the	hope	of	
stumbling	across	some	value	essentially	playing	the	lottery	with	shareholder’s	equity	and	losing.

Additionally,	as	can	be	seen	in	the	graph	below,	while	its	acquisitions	have	helped	boost	revenue	they	
have	made	minimal	impact	on	net	income!	Even	accounting	for	the	goodwill	charge	taken	in	FY2016,	the	
Company	would	likely	still	be	loss	making.	This	implies	that	there	is	likely	to	be	little	to	no	value	in	the	
acquisitions	that	Aeria	has	made.	
	


	
		
Additionally,	it	is	worth	noting	that	if	all	the	warrants	that	have	been	issues	as	part	of	the	acquisitions	are	
exercised	then	investors	can	look	forward	to	at	least	16.3%	dilution.

CONCLUSION	AND	VALUATION	
	
From	January	2008	until	January	2017,	Aeria’s	market	capitalization	rarely	surpassed	¥10	billion.		Since	
the	release	of	A3!	though	its	stock	price	has	exploded	pushing	Aeria’s	market	capitalization	to	over	¥35	
billion.		
	


	
	
	
The	cause	for	this	rerating	was	the	release	and	apparent	success	of	the	game	A3!	by	Aeria’s	subsidiary	
Liber	 Entertainment.	 However,	 as	we	 have	 shown,	 A3!	 game	 is	 not	 nearly	 as	 successful	 as	 Aeria	 has	
implied.	Aeria	appears	to	have	misled	investors	by	claiming	the	game	has	been	downloaded	over	4	million	
times	 and	 continues	 to	 be	 heavily	 downloaded,	 however,	 third	 party	 data	 shows	 A3!	 has	 been	
downloaded	less	than	830,000	times,	almost	80%	less	than	the	company	claims!	Growth	is	also	lackluster	
contrary	to	Aeria’s	claims.	We	believe	that	Aeria	has	included	downloads	from	“Marathon	Resets”	in	their	
numbers	and,	as	such,	the	majority	of	the	downloads	are	not	additional	new	users	providing	new	revenue	
but	current	users	deleting	and	reinstalling	their	apps	to	game	bonuses	they	receive.		
	
Without	new	real	users,	the	revenue	and	profits	from	A3!	are	likely	to	dry	up	and	Aeria	will	remain	just	
an	assortment	of	worthless	acquisitions.	
	
Aeria	has	taken	goodwill	charges	of	almost	50%	of	the	value	of	the	acquisitions	they	made	just	a	year	after	
the	transactions	took	place.	Indeed,	Aeria	has	continued	to	amass	acquisitions,	but	based	on	its	poor	M&A	
history,	we	do	not	ascribe	any	value	for	shareholders	in	these.	A3!	arguably	has	been	Aeria’s	only	tangible	
success	considering	that	it	has	continued	to	post	operating	losses	in	its	online	content	businesses	even	
with	its	Klee	and	I-chu	games	and	we	do	not	believe	the	Company	will	be	able	to	repeat	this	success.	In	
terms	of	A3!,	we	assume	that	the	game	will	generate	net	profit	of		¥1.8	billion	for	FY2017	and	flat	net	
profit	in	FY2018,	these	are	significantly	generous	assumptions	as	the	revenue	from	the	game	is	already	
declining	and	the	rate	of	the	decline	is	expected	to	increase	both	in	FY2017	and	FY2018.	As	a	result,	we
17	
	


value	Aeria	at	¥465	per	share,	a	downside	of	over	70%	on	a	fully	dilutive	basis	including	warrants15.	We	
set	a	reasonable	PE	multiple	to	50%	of	comparable	companies	in	the	same	industry.	But	considering	that	
the	company	has	been	making	loss	except	for	A3!,	it	is	likely	that	this	may	be	still	overvalued.	
	
	





																																																													
15	We	include	the	effect	of	issuing	new	shares	due	to	the	acquisition	of	Total	Management	which	is	estimated	based	on	the	
current	stock	price	and	the	impact	of	the	exercise	of	any	of	the	warrants	that	have	been	issued.
