Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. 
 
In this report, we present compelling evidence that Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. (“ABAT” or the 
“Company”) is fabricating its SEC financial statements. We believe that the Company’s revenue and profit 
are highly overstated in its SEC filings. We have created a video where we discuss our findings: Part 1 is 
here and Part 2 is here. Our evidence includes: 
 


• SAIC filings show that ABAT is reporting significantly lower revenue and profit to the authorities in 
China. For 2009, SAIC filings showed less than $2 million of revenue, compared to $64 million in 
SEC filings.  


• ABAT has unreasonably high margins in an established industry with strong competitors.  The 
Company’s SEC-reported margins and return on capital are virtually impossible. Out of 106 global 
battery manufacturers as classified by Bloomberg, ABAT has the highest operating profit margin by 
a wide margin. When compared to six leading Chinese battery makers, ABAT’s operating margin is 
triple that of its closest competitor and six times that of the median operating margin of the 
comparable companies. 


• Site visits show underutilized facilities lacking in quality 
control. We hired investigators to visit both the Harbin and 
Wuxi facilities, and provide photos as well as commentary 
from our investigators. Our investigators concluded that 
both facilities produce commodity, low-margin products 
that are highly unlikely to be generating industry-leading 
margins or return on capital. 


• In December 2010, ABAT announced that it was acquiring 
a Shenzhen battery maker for $20 million. We believe this 
acquisition is a sham, and that ABAT paid $20 million in 
2010 for an entity that they had previously bought in 2008 
for $1 million, but had not disclosed to public investors. 


• Confirmation from former customers and partners that the 
Company is likely a fraud. After visiting one of ABAT’s 
plants, one customer called the facility “absolutely the biggest joke I’d ever seen”. A recording of the 
conversation is available here. In another conversation available here and here, a customer said the 
CEO admitted to hiring an accounting firm "to cook his stock price up". 


• Low quality auditors and high turnover. The Company has had 4 auditors in the past 7 years, with no 
auditor being ranked in the top global 100 auditors at the time of hire.  


• Unqualified CFOs and high turnover. A CFO or auditor has resigned at least once a year. The 
Company’s past three CFOs have included: (i) a company insider who has been general manager of 
the Company’s main operating subsidiary since 2004, and is therefore not remotely independent, (ii) 
a 29-year-old who was formerly VP Finance at China Natural Gas, another fraud, and (iii) a 
candidate whose primary experience comprised of being a financial adviser at Smith Barney.  


• Continuous share dilution through secondary offerings, despite having more than adequate cash 
reserves. Through repeated share issuances, the Company has grown its outstanding shares from 
10.0 million following the 2004 reverse merger to 76.4 million today.  





Our estimated fundamental value for ABAT is $0.00

Introduction 
 
Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. is yet another fraudulent U.S-listed Chinese stock that the 
Securities and Exchange Commission can add to its list of targets for investigation. We believe 
that the Company’s actual revenue is materially less than the revenue reported to the SEC, and 
that the underlying operations are not profitable. Given that ABAT’s SEC filings are fabricated, 
we’re not sure exactly how small the actual business is. We are confident, however, that ABAT 
should be investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for filing falsified financial 
statements.  
 
Since the Company is engaging in fraud and likely has no intention of providing a meaningful 
return to public foreign shareholders, we think that the stock is fundamentally worth $0.00. 
ABAT should be de-listed from the NASDAQ stock exchange.  
 


The Company 
 
ABAT’s main operating business is the manufacturing and sale of polymer lithium-ion batteries. 
In 2009, the Company also acquired a business that makes and sells electric and hybrid-
powered motorbikes, scooters and SUVs. In the year ended December 31, 2010, batteries 
comprised 55% of sales and electric vehicles comprised 45% of sales.  
 
The Company went public in July 2004 through a reverse merger. ABAT controls two main 
operating subsidiaries: Heilongjiang ZhongQiang Power-Tech Co., Ltd. (“Heilongjiang ZQPT”) 
and Wuxi ZhongQiang Autocycle Co., Ltd. (“Wuxi ZQ”). Heilongjiang ZQPT operates the battery 
business; it was set up in 2002 and its manufacturing facilities first became operational in 2004. 
Wuxi ZQ operates the motorbikes/scooters business and was purchased by ABAT in May 2009.

SAIC Filings 
 


Businesses that operate in China file their financial statements with the State Administration for 
Industry and Commerce. These statements are an excellent place to start piecing together the 
truth. Non-fraudulent Chinese companies submit financial statements to the SAIC that resemble 
those published in the US.  ABAT’s filings in China indicate that ABAT is earning a tiny fraction 
of the revenue reported to the SEC and generating millions of dollars of losses rather than 
profits. 
 
ABAT’s corporate structure is simple.  Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. owns Cashtech 
Investment Limited, which owns two key subsidiaries.   
 
The first is Harbin ZhongQiang Power-Tech Co., Ltd. (“Harbin ZQPT”), which “holds the 
government lease of the real property on which [the] battery operations are located”.  Harbin 
ZQPT manages Heilongjiang ZhongQiang Power-Tech Co., Ltd. (Heilongjiang ZQPT), which is 
the actual operating subsidiary. For our purposes, we are interested in the SAIC filings of 
Heilongjiang ZQPT. Note that we have also checked the SAIC financials of Harbin ZQPT and 
the entity generates negligible revenue.  
 
The second subsidiary owned by Cashtech is Wuxi ZhongQiang Autocycle Co., Ltd. (“Wuxi 
ZQ”), which was acquired in 2009 and manufactures electric vehicles powered by ZQ Power-
Tech batteries.  Prior to being acquired, this company was called Wuxi Angell Autocycle Co., 
Ltd.

English translations. Harbin ZQPT filings and translations are also available on request:

Wuxi ZQ 2009 SAIC Filings in Chinese 
Wuxi ZQ 2009 SAIC Filings in English Translation 
 
In the cases of both Heilongjiang ZQPT and Wuxi ZQ, the SAIC filings tell a very different story 
than the SEC filings.   
 
Below is a summary of ABAT’s 2009 SAIC filings:  


SAIC Filings for 2009


Units are in CNY (thousands)


Wuxi Angell Harbin ZQPT Heilongjiang ZQPT
Revenue 4,790            -                8,136                         
Gross Profit (600)              -                (6,244)                       
Net Income (12,670)         (307)              (14,351)                     


Total Assets 199,960        139,344        116,010

Below is a comparison of ABAT’s SEC and SAIC financial figures:  


A Comparison of SEC and Consolidated SAIC Filings for 2009


Units are in $ (millions)
and assume an average conversion rate of 6.83 CNY/USD


SEC SAIC
Revenue 63.562$         1.893$           
Gross Profit 28.392$         (1.002)$          
Net Income 21.360$         (4.001)$          


Total Assets 157.826$       66.664$         
Shareholder Equity 131.932$       32.483$         


 
In 2009, Heilongjiang ZQPT generated revenue of $1.2 million and a loss of $2.1 million, 
assuming average conversion rates of 6.83 CNY/USD. In 2008, Heilongjiang ZQPT generated 
revenue of $934k and a loss of $825k, assuming an average conversion rate of 6.95.   
 
In 2009, Wuxi ZQ generated revenue of $702k in 2009 and a loss of $1.9 million, assuming 
average conversion rates of 6.83 CNY/USD. In 2008, Wuxi ZQ generated revenue of $934k and 
a loss of $2.7m. It is possible that the lower revenue and losses reported in 2009 at Wuxi ZQ 
are a result of the acquisition midway through the year.  But readers should understand that the 
SAIC filings indicate business performance as of December 31, 2009.  Interestingly, the SAIC 
numbers are in a similar magnitude to losses reported by ABAT management in the Risk Factor 
section of the 2009 annual report: 
 


Wuxi ZQ recorded substantial net losses in each of its past two fiscal years: a net loss of 
$3,727,136 in the year ended December 31, 2008 and a net loss of $1,150,719 in the 
year ended December 31, 2007. In 2009, even after we took control of management, 
Wuxi ZQ continued to lose money, finishing 2009 with a net loss of $1,392,821.

In the case of a consolidated ABAT, the SAIC filings show much lower sales and profit than the 
SEC filings.  It's obvious that the numbers above aren't simply accounting irregularities or 
rounding errors.  Throughout the remainder of this report, we will demonstrate that the 
discrepancies indicate deliberate deceit by management.   
 


Impossible Economics 
 
Selling a commodity product into a competitive market with no technological advantage is 
difficult. It's especially difficult for a small business without economies of scale, limited customer 
relationships, and no distinguished brand name.  But ABAT purports to be not just surviving, but 
thriving with industry-leading margins and an ROIC that warrants explanation.  
 
A company with an EBITDA margin of 45% in 2010 must have some uniquely special 
competitive advantage. Yet ABAT itself recognizes that it has no special technology for its main 
products. The following is taken from its annual report: 
 


The technology utilized in producing polymer lithium-ion batteries is widely available 
throughout the world, and is utilized by many competitors, both great and small.  ZQ 
Power-Tech’s patents give it some competitive advantage with respect to certain 
products.  However, the key to competitive success will be ZQ Power Tech’s ability to 
deliver high quality products in a cost-efficient manner.  This, in turn, will depend on the 
quality and efficiency of the assembly lines that we have been developing at our plant in 
Harbin. 


 
In choosing a set of comparable companies for ABAT, we’ll use companies listed by Bloomberg 
in its “Batteries/Battery Systems” industry classification.  
 
The results are startling. In terms of EBIT margin, ABAT ranked #1 out of 106 global companies, 
with an EBIT margin of 39%, compared to 23% for the next closest competitor Exide Industries 
Ltd of India, a $40 billion revenue business.

Out of the 106 companies provided by Bloomberg in the “Batteries/Battery Systems” 
classification, Bloomberg records the EBIT margins for 79 of them (the remaining companies’ 
margins are shown as “N.A.”). ABAT reports a 39% EBIT margin. Only three other companies 
report EBIT margins above 20%, one of which is NEWN, another suspect Chinese reverse 
merger company. Only 10 companies report EBIT margins above 15%. ABAT, a company with 
less than $100m of sales and a relatively tiny player in a commodity industry, is an extreme 
outlier in our analysis. ABAT also comes up top in other profit margin metrics, with the #1 
ranking in EBITDA margin and #2 ranking in net income margin.  
 
Is it possible that a company with only about 5 years of operating experience is generating 
higher margins than a company such as Energizer with its 15% EBIT margins, based on the 
“quality and efficiency of the assembly lines”?   
 
Perhaps it's ABAT's position in China and access to cheap labor that gives it such an amazing 
edge in the global arena.  We can test this hypothesis by comparing ABAT to a handful of other 
Chinese battery manufacturers.  The independent third party research organization Research in 
China publishes an annual report titled “Global and China Rechargeable Lithium Battery 
Industry Report”.  In the 184 pages of the 2009-2010 edition, no mention is made of ABAT or its 
subsidiaries.  The report does, however, make mention of China BAK Battery Inc. (BAK), BYD 
Company (BYD), SCUD Group Ltd, and Tianjin Lishen, which generate respective revenue of 
$222m, $5,805m, $185m, and $295m.   
 
Other Chinese battery manufacturers which are not active in the lithium polymer market can 
also be compared to ABAT.  Examples include the Coslight Technology International Group 
Limited and Tianneng Power International Limited, with $352m and $330m of revenue 
respectively in 2009.  Gross margins and operating profit margins for all six of these companies,

as well as ABAT, have been summarized in the table below for the most recent available fiscal 
year: 
 


Company Gross Margins Operating Profit Margins 


China BAK Battery, Inc. 10.6% -9.7% 


BYD Company 17.7% 7.3% 


SCUD Group Ltd 18.1% 5.8% 


Tianjin Lishen*  5.4% 


Coslight Technology 26.6% 9.1% 


Tianneng Power 28.5% 14.3% 


ABAT 47.3% 39.0% 
*This is a subsidiary of CNOOC and financial statements were not readily ascertainable, although it is evident that the 
Research In China report is using numbers specific to Tianjin Lishen. 
 
ABAT’s operating margin is nearly triple that of its closest competitor and six times that of the 
median operating margin of our Chinese battery makers.  
 
Obviously, strong operating performance alone would not normally be cause for concern.  But 
when a company is doing as well as ABAT, investors need to understand why or how.  ABAT 
clearly states in its annual report that it has limited (if any) technological advantage, and is 
competing in what is predominantly a commodity market.  We have spoken to a customer who 
has visited ABAT’s Harbin battery manufacturing plant, and he has stated that there was 
nothing uniquely special about the Harbin facility. We also hired investigators to visit the Harbin 
facility and their findings are discussed later in this report.  
 
The founder of ABAT, Zhiguo Fu, established it in 2001 without any prior knowledge, 
experience, or expertise relating to batteries or manufacturing.  Fu's background is in real 
estate.  Furthermore, this company didn't begin manufacturing until 2004.  ABAT has limited 
operating experience, an unrecognized brand name, and production facilities too small to claim 
economies of scale.  Yet it seems like no matter how we compare ABAT to its competitors, 
ABAT’s financial figures come out ahead despite the numerous causes for concern discussed 
elsewhere in this report. 
 
The Above Comparison was Conservative 
 
The gross margins and operating profit margins quoted above for ABAT include both the 
Heilongjiang ZQPT operations and the Wuxi ZQ operations. The margins for Wuxi ZQ, which 
makes the electric vehicles, are substantially lower than the margins for Heilongjiang ZQPT, 
which is responsible for battery manufacturing. If we exclude the electric vehicle business, the 
battery operation’s segment EBIT margin for 2010 was actually 46%, which is even more 
inflated than the 39% figure quoted on Bloomberg and shown in our comparable company 
comparison above.  
 
This Harbin plant is either the world’s most spectacular battery manufacturing facility, or the 
Company’s financial statements are fiction. We believe that it’s the latter. 
 
In the words of John Bird, the godfather of Chinese reverse merger fraud exposés, "It's like 
somebody telling you they just drove over here at 600 miles per hour. It's not going to happen."

Wuxi's Highly Unlikely Turnaround 
 
ABAT acquired the Wuxi ZQ operations in May 2009, when it announced that it would acquire 
Wuxi Angell Autocycle Co., Ltd. for $13.9m in cash and 3m ABAT shares (worth $9.9m given 
the $3.29 closing price of ABAT shares as of May 4, 2009, the date of acquisition). The cash 
was used to retire Wuxi’s various liabilities, given that the Wuxi operations were highly indebted, 
delinquent on payments to creditors, and in operational disarray.  
 
On July 20, 2009, ABAT filed an 8K providing Wuxi Angell’s historical financial statements. The 
8K paints a bleak picture of Wuxi Angell’s historical operations. Below is a financial summary of 
the Wuxi operations prior to their acquisition by ABAT:

As we can see, the Wuxi operations generated negative operating profit in fiscal years 2007 and 
2008 and the last twelve months ended March 31, 2009. Revenue declined to a mere $749k in 
the most recent quarter prior to ABAT’s acquisition and no money was being invested in capital 
expenditures. The Company had net debt of $9.2m on March 31, 2009 and couldn’t generate 
cash flow to service it, given its operating loss of $3.8m in the prior 12 months. It had negative 
working capital of $15.9m. It was being sued for non-payment by numerous creditors, including

Co., Ltd. for delinquent payments of more than $2m.  
 
Yet if we are to believe the SEC financial statements, ABAT was able to rapidly transform the 
Wuxi operations into a world-class electric scooter manufacturer within a few mere months. 
Below are charts comparing revenue and EBITDA at the Wuxi operations prior to and 
subsequent to ABAT’s acquisition in May 2009:

Revenue Operating Profit


Wuxi financial figures prior 


to acquisition by ABAT Wuxi financial figures after acquisition by ABAT


 
 
In its very first full quarter of owning Wuxi, ABAT was able to generate 19% EBITDA margins in 
the Wuxi segment, compared to the facility’s negative EBITDA throughout 2008 and the first 
quarter of 2009. By the first quarter of 2010, the Wuxi segment was posting an EBITDA margin 
of 30% and by the third quarter of 2010, the EBITDA margin had grown to 40%.  
 
Revenue growth was astronomical too. By the final quarter of 2009, the Wuxi operations were 
generating more than 10 times as much revenue as they had in the most recent quarter prior to 
ABAT’s acquisition. A business that generated $6m revenue in 2008 and $20m revenue in 2009 
was suddenly able to generate $49m revenue in 2010. Another spectacular performance by 
ABAT management! 
 
It’s theoretically possible that ABAT executives are superhuman turnaround experts. It’s far 
more likely that they are lying about their numbers.  
 


Wuxi ZQ Site Visit 
 
As part of our investment research process, we sent an experienced factory inspector to the 
Wuxi Angell autocycle production facility.  What we found was not encouraging. 
 


• Out of four assembly lines, only three were operational. 
• Staff included 200+ workers, but only 20 are office workers, indicating likely weaknesses 


in R&D, engineering, QC, and sales.

• Factory management indicated 20,000 unit sales for 2010, with prices ranging from 
$450-$920 USD.  This compares to 90,000 units reported to us by ABAT VP of Finance 
Dan Cheng on a conference call, a number which can also be backed into using data 
provided in ABAT’s 10-k. 


• The facility does not have a motorcycle manufacturer’s permit issued by the Chinese 
government. 


o Management claims to use the VIN of a partner, which is illegal. 
• Our investigators’ greatest concern was the lack of quality control (QC). 


o No line inspector or inspection of finished products. 
o No inspection list attached to each bike. 
o No testing center inside the factory. 
o The facility lacked basic equipment to test different parts for new product 


development. 
o Motor speed and efficiency testing machines were present, but no noise, 


temperature, or salt-fog testing machines. 
o No incoming parts inspection. 


 
The quality control issues described above are further evidenced in our conversations with 
ABAT customers presented later in this report.  Our investigator also took numerous pictures:

Harbin ZhongQiang Power-Tech Site Visit 
 
As lacking as the facilities were in the Wuxi facility, the Power-Tech site visit was even more 
disturbing in light of the world-class margins and the Company’s reliance on this facility to 
support the bottom line. 
 
Our investigators concluded the following: 
 


It appears that the Harbin plant is in operation, does produce cells, and has sales.  The 
semi-automated processes… are more advanced than some of the battery companies of 
China, and far less advanced than battery companies of international standing such 
as ATL, Lishen, Samsung, LG Chem. It appears that they do some things well, and have 
some potential great strength, but appear to have limited ability and concepts in the 
marketing and sales of their product. Selling cells to packagers is a common business 
model for Asian battery factories, but not one that realizes as much profit. And I note that 
the CTO acknowledged that the packagers and trading companies were making the 
entire margin and he was not. Again, normal for Asian cell makers – but not a way to 
gain success. 
 
A proprietary BMS (Battery Management System) is essential for a successful battery 
company in the Light Electric Vehicle space. And the lack of such is a major handicap for 
Harbin.  It appears to me that this company has a tiny business selling Li Ma or LFP 
(Lithium Iron Phosphate) cells to packagers for use in low priced battery packages sold to 
the domestic China market. This is the least profitable business they could have.  
The LI-Polymer cells are apparently not really in production (the normal issue with Li

16 





poly) due to high cost of materials and resulting high cost of the cells making them 
uninteresting to most applications.  The LFP cells cannot be exported due to patent 
issues… So the only apparent product for any significant sales would be Lithium 
Manganese cells, and for that to make money for Harbin they would, probably, 
need to develop their own BMS, become their own packager, and compete with 
Phylion, Zhenlong, AEE, MGL, LG Chem, Lishen, HYB, and others. 


 
Unfortunately we were not able to photograph the interior of the facility.  Our investigator 
requested permission, but pictures were not allowed.   
 


Veken Vs. ABAT 
 
On October 16, 2008, ABAT issued a press release announcing a “five-year sales contract with 
Veken USA Co. Ltd.” in which “ABAT anticipates delivering 10,000 sets of battery modules per 
month to Veken USA, generating approximately $27 million in annual revenue”. ABAT refers to 
Veken USA as a “a China-based multi-billion dollar corporation and one of the world's leading 
OEM manufacturers serving many famous power sports brands”.  
 
In actuality, Veken USA was a tiny entity run by only a few people and did “not have any 
business or management relationship” with the multibillion dollar Veken Group based out of 
China, according to a letter we’ve acquired from the China-based Veken.  
 
Specifically, the term “Veken” is used by three separate companies, each discussed in detail 
below:   
 


1. The Veken Group in China is a multibillion-dollar revenue conglomerate that has a 
subsidiary involved in batteries: Ningbo Veken Battery Co., Ltd. The Veken Group’s 
website that can be found here and a link to the website of the Ningbo Veken subsidiary 
can be found here.   


 
2. Veken USA Company Ltd. is a tiny company based in the US that is run by a few 


people and its website can be found here. The company description page claims that 
Veken USA has “financial backings” of Veken Group. Two months ago, the website 
claimed that Veken USA “is the marketing branch of the power sports division of Veken 
Group in China”, which can be seen in this screenshot here. ABAT has also described 
Veken USA as “a China-based multi-billion dollar corporation and one of the world's 
leading OEM manufacturers serving many famous power sports brands”. All of these 
statements are grossly inaccurate, because based on the letter provided below, Veken 
Group makes it clear that it is unaffiliated with Veken USA.   


 
3. Veken Scooters is a company based in the US that was owned by Fred and Kurt 


Gruenberg. The Gruenbergs, as well as their partner Alice Hu, were tricked into 
believing that Veken USA was a reliable scooter manufacturer that could source reliable 
electric vehicles for distribution in the U.S. This company is no longer operational and 
never sold any scooters. 


 
Below is a letter from the multibillion-dollar China-based Veken Group denying an affiliation with 
the U.S.-based Veken USA Co. Ltd.:

Nine months after the initial press release, on July 21, 2009, Veken Scooters filed a complaint 
against ABAT, available here. The suit claimed that electric scooters delivered from ABAT were 
“not manufactured and/or assembled in a workmanlike manner and required immediate work 
and/or repairs by Plaintiff Veken”, that they didn’t meet U.S. EPA standards, and that they were 
not properly registered or did not contain proper vehicle identification numbers to be licensed.  
Veken asked only to exchange the defective merchandise and to be compensated for some 
basic damages. 
 
This lawsuit is additional proof of the low quality and defective nature of Wuxi’s products.  This 
general theme has been corroborated numerous times throughout our research process. 
According to ABAT’s financial statements, the Company was able to turn around the Wuxi 
operations from a factory unable to create products “in a workmanlike manner” in 2009 to a 
company generating 32% segment EBIT margins in 2010. We think this is highly unlikely. While 
we believe that Wuxi ZQ sells electric scooters and scooter parts in some shape or form, we’re 
highly doubtful of the unit’s sales and profit figures as reported in SEC filings. As we wrote

previously, ABAT executives are either superhuman turnaround experts, or they’re liars. We 
suspect it’s the latter.  
 


The Fraudulent Shenzhen Zhongqiang Acquisition 
 
On December 20, 2010, ABAT announced that it would acquire a Shenzhen-based battery 
maker called “Shenzhen Zhongqiang New Energy Science & Technology Co., Ltd.” for 
approximately $20 million.  
 
We believe this acquisition is a sham, and that ABAT paid $20 million in 2010 for an entity that 
they had previously bought in 2008 for $1 million, but had not disclosed to public investors. 
We’ve seen numerous situations where fraudulent Chinese RTO companies use acquisitions as 
justifications to transfer cash from public shareholders to related parties. This appears to be one 
such circumstance.  
 
We know that ABAT acquired the Shenzhen battery company in 2008 because the acquisition 
was discussed in a lawsuit filed by Sui-Yang Huang on September 30, 2009. Sui-Yang Huang‘s 
father owned the former battery maker, and he sued ABAT in U.S. courts over a compensation 
dispute in September 2009. Specifically, Huang’s father owned Shenzhen Shengxi Science and 
Technology Co., Ltd. (“Shenzhen SST”), which was sold to ABAT for $1 million.  
 
This can be verified from the court documents, such as ABAT’s memorandum available here or 
in the affidavit of Xiezhong Zeng. We’ve pasted the acquisition agreement that is included in 
Exhibit A of the Zeng affidavit below:

As we can see, ABAT purchased Shengxi Science and Technology Co., Ltd. for $1 million. The 
agreement is dated as of August 31, 2008, demonstrating that the acquisition occurred in 2008. 
As we can also see, after purchasing the target, ABAT changed the name of the company to 
Shenzhen Zhongqiang Energy Technology Co., Ltd. Furthermore, Zhiguo Fu became the legal 
representative of Shenzhen Zhongqiang Energy Technology Co., Ltd. in September 2008, as 
can be seen from this link to the Shenzhen SAIC registration website (screenshot included here 
in Chinese and English translation) 
 
No aspect of this acquisition was disclosed in SEC filings in 2008 or 2009, which itself is 
materially fraudulent. When public companies make acquisitions, they are required to disclose 
acquisitions in SEC filings because acquisitions are material events. ABAT did not do so. 
Instead, ABAT waited until December 2010 and then announced that it was acquiring Shenzhen 
Zhongqiang Energy Technology Co., Ltd. for $20 million.  
 
This is $19 million more than ABAT actually paid in 2008 to purchase the same company. 
 
As a final note, we’ll briefly mention a final point about Huang’s suit. After bringing suit, Huang 
claims to have been fired from his position as CTO and told to “work at an ABAT facility located 
over 1,800 miles from his home”, and to have suffered “intentional infliction of emotional distress 
due to death threats that he received after bringing suit”.  This information can be confirmed in 
the Opinion and Order filed with Justia which can be found here. The death threats are available 
in Exhibits H and K in this court document. We’ve pasted them below from the affidavit:  
 


  
We tried contacting Huang through his lawyers but have thus far been unsuccessful.

Conversations with ABAT Customers 
 
Since Advanced Battery's inception, management has made numerous claims regarding 
relationships with suppliers, distributors, research partners, and other related parties.  As part of 
our due diligence process, we have attempted to contact most of the relevant parties that ABAT 
has mentioned having a relationship with.  In many cases, the parties we have contacted have 
been nonexistent, non-locatable, unwilling to speak, or had something strongly negative to say 
about ABAT.   
 
In multiple cases, we found customers who either came away from their visits to the Company’s 
factories unimpressed or confident that the Company was inflating its financial figures. In this 
section, we provide a recording with one such customer, but have concealed and modified his 
voice.  
 
This customer had signed a contract to receive scooters from ABAT’s Wuxi facility in 2009. After 
receiving defective product, the customer demanded to visit the Wuxi facility that had 
supposedly been manufacturing the scooters. During our conversation, the customer indicated 
that he had visited numerous other Chinese manufacturing facilities to which Wuxi could be 
compared, and he described the Wuxi facility as a “joke” multiple times.  The facility was 
described as “four empty walls”, the inadequacy of which made him suspect Wuxi was some 
sort of distributor operation rather than a manufacturing facility.  Furthermore, the customer 
stated that he thought about contacting the SEC to report ABAT for fraudulent claims made in 
press releases.  He said that “none of the stuff they put out was accurate”. 
 
Click here for a link to a recorded excerpt from our conversation 
 
Below is a transcription from the above recording of our conversation with the customer:  
 
Prescience: Now how does Wuxi fit into the mix here? 


 
Customer: Wuxi Angell Factory was in Wuxi – it was Wuxi Angell... They were the one that 


Zhao Ping had some type of agreement with them to do the manufacturing of the 
Veken product. When we got involved, unfortunately we didn’t know that it was 
the tail end of Wuxi being in business. Apparently – oh, gosh, what was his name, 
I forgot the owner’s name, he had rung up all kinds of multimillion dollar bills that 
he had to pay and couldn’t afford production and so forth – so when we actually 
showed up to the factory in October of 2008, or 2009 – I think it was maybe 2009 
– when we showed up to the factory, they weren’t doing any manufacturing at all. 
There was nothing going on. They had a showroom, but it was an empty shell of a 
building. So the whole thing started to - all the pieces started to come into place 
because at that point when we had gotten there, it was only 2 months after we 
first signed this agreement with Mr. Ping. And they sent us three samples that 
were perfect, and then they sent us a whole container where every single one in 
the container was junk and then while we’re out there, they admitted to us that 
they knew it was junk. That they had all of this product that they had made that 
had failed, but they had to get some money in, so they sold all the product to us. 
And they knew that when the container left, that it was all junk. Everybody knew. 
 


Prescience: Now would you happen to have pictures of your visit of the factory? 
 


Customer: Um, I don’t know if I have pictures of that visit, because they didn’t want us to visit 
the factory. So I pulled a fast one on them. And what I did was they kept saying 
‘Oh yeah we’re going to fix all the problems, we’re going to fix all the problems’, 
and they kept bringing samples to the front of the facility. And it was a series of 6-

8 buildings, and what I did was – it was still warm at that point when we were 
there and they had overhead doors open to these buildings – when I was test 
driving these new hybrid scooters, I was driving through the buildings. I would 
take it to the end of the block and I would be sneaky and I would go through one 
overhead door and out the other. So [in] one building where they were supposed 
to be doing manufacturing, it was all these dust-covered frames in one corner, 
and it was obvious to tell that there was nothing going on there. Nothing going on. 
Their QC department was 3 or 4 dust-covered machines and 2 schleps sitting in 
an office where there was nothing happening. And they were like ‘oh yeah we QC 
everything blah blah blah’ and it was such bullshit. And you can tell – we visited 
so many factories.  We went to a different area that specializes in motorsports and 
you could see that they have all the equipment to do all the testing. Here, they just 
threw some stuff in there and it was never touched.  
 


Prescience Are you comparing it to other companies that you visited? 
 


Customer Yes, legitimate companies.  
 


Prescience So there was a significant difference there? 
 


Customer Oh my god, yes. It was a joke. It was absolutely the biggest joke I’d ever seen. 
Any normal person that came through there would realize that it was a joke.  
 


 
The customer frustration exemplified above is not isolated to just one customer.  Other 
customers we’ve been in touch with have voiced similar opinions of ABAT.  For example, in 
2010 ABAT touted an agreement to re-enter the US market, expecting to deliver 2,000 electric 
scooter units to All-Power America for $1.1 million.  Only half the delivery was taken before 
serious issues surfaced regarding quality control and licensing.  The following quote is one 
excerpt from the long conversation we had regarding these issues and more with an All-Power 
executive: 
 
All-Power: Every step of the way we had some serious QC issues… The licensing is the 


official word that we gave out to everybody because that was a very tangible 
problem that the retailer used to return the products.  But licensing was a major 
part of it, they should have checked for licensing compliance before they sent it. 
 


Prescience: So Wuxi, which is the company that you got the cycles from, they sent you shitty 
product, am I reading you right?  I’m not sure if I follow you? 
 


All-Power: Yeah, and that caused a major loss of confidence with our customer.  Plus we 
missed a lot of deadlines, and the customer said “you missed a lot of deadlines 
plus you have licensing issues, we’re going to send you all of them back”.  So 
they put them on trucks and sent them back.  Now we’re stuck with the inventory 
that I don’t know how the hell to move. 


 
In conjunction with the evidence from the Veken Scooter case described above, we see how 
management has twice produced excessively optimistic press releases announcing the release 
of ABAT brand products in the US.  Each time, they have sent inferior, unusable products, and 
left customers on the hook.  This compares to the language provided by Fu announcing the 
relationship with All-Power: 
 


This new order is an example of management’s significant progress in expanding and 
servicing overseas customers. Entering the US market is a very important milestone for 
us and the renewal of orders from our current customer base in Europe, the Middle East

and South East Asia only adds to the recognition our eco-friendly electric vehicles are 
receiving all around the world. 


 
Wuxi ZQ mentions additional customers in its February 3, 2010 press release and its 2010 10K. 
We review our diligence with some of these customers below:  


 
Ampere 
Our attempts to contact Ampere proved successful, and management indicated a productive 
and ongoing relationship with ABAT. The Wuxi facility does indeed appear to be distributing 
scooter parts to Ampere. Ampere purchases the parts from ABAT and then constructs the 
final product on-site in India. However, the Ampere executive with whom we spoke 
confirmed our belief that ABAT’s products are not uniquely special, or particularly different 
from other suppliers, such that the Company can generate margins that are orders of 
magnitude above competitors’. Rather, Ampere selected ABAT because they “follow 
instructions better” than other scooter parts suppliers. The conversation was further 
evidence that Wuxi ZQ does not produce a product deserving of industry-leading margins.  


 
Autoplaza Holdings 
We didn’t find any information about a company called Autoplaza Holdings. An internet 
search yielded no relevant results other than ABAT filings and media reports discussing 
ABAT. 


 
Eco Style Di  
We could find no information about a company with this name. Eco Style Di, which 
translates to "Eco Style Of", isn’t listed in the Italian yellow or white pages (Pagine Gialle, 
Pagine Bianche) and an internet search yielded no relevant results other than ABAT filings 
and media reports discussing ABAT. 
 
Floretti 
Our attempts to contact Floretti, also called Tradeforme BV, proved successful, and 
management indicated a productive and ongoing relationship with ABAT.  Floretti sources 
electric scooters from ABAT and ABAT is one of several scooter suppliers that Floretti uses.  


 
Kanuni Motorcycle 
We spoke to an executive at Kanuni Motors. They did not recognize Wuxi ZhongQiang or 
Advanced Battery Technologies as a supplier to them of batteries or scooters. They said 
that they do not have any suppliers with factories in Wuxi.  


 
Motoran 
Attempts to contact this company have failed, both by phone and email.  Management did 
not return our numerous calls. We attempted to contact Motoran both from our offices in the 
US, and through investigators located in Turkey. 


 
Menzaghi Motors  
We spoke with the CEO of Menzaghi Motors, Paolo Pinciroli. Pinciroli confirmed that they 
are a customer of Wuxi ZQ and have known them for “3 or 4 years”. They’ve ordered 
approximately 100 scooters from them annually, providing further evidence that Wuxi is 
inflating its sales numbers. For Wuxi ZQ to meet its sales targets, it would need to export at 
least 30,000 scooters annually.

We also got the following quote from Menzaghi Motors: “Sometimes when I [visit] this 
company, I see the people work. Some other times, the people don’t work, I don’t know 
why.” 
 
Pinciroli compared Wuxi ZQ to other scooter suppliers that they use. It was clear that 
several of their other suppliers provided higher quality products and quickly corrected 
mistakes. For instance, Pinciroli said: “[The competitor] solves the problems in a short time. 
[Wuxi] takes too much time – these people don’t understand the situation in the market. Of 
course, I see only the European market, but I cannot tell to our customer that you must wait 
3 months, 4 months or 5 months before your problem is solved.” 


 
We also asked whether Wuxi ZQ’s scooters suffered from any quality control issues. His 
response: “I don’t think that [Wuxi ZQ] have people to control quality because sometimes I 
see one man – the chief of the line of production – he tests a vehicle, but for 10 meters, not 
more [chuckle]. I don’t think they have a serious quality control [department], like, for 
example, Jinstar, Iden, Sukida, Kai-sun. These other companies have special departments 
to control quality. [Wuxi ZQ] I don’t think cares.” 
 
We concluded from our conversation that Wuxi ZQ was not a significant supplier to 
Menzaghi Motors, and that the quality of their product was average, as opposed to one 
deserving of industry-leading margins.  
 
Tinterparts Trading GmbH 
We were unable to locate any information about this company. Tinterparts Trading is not 
listed in the German telephone book (Das Telefonbuch) and an internet search yielded no 
relevant results other than ABAT filings and media reports discussing ABAT. 





Conversations with ABAT Partners 
 
Alongside numerous ruined or strained customer relationships, we have also uncovered a 
number of failed partner relationships.   


 
ZAP 
In July 2007, ABAT signed an agreement with ZAP to supply $5.168m worth of batteries for 
ZAP’s vehicles. ZAP, a publicly traded electric vehicle developer that trades under the ticker 
ZAAP, reported total COGS of $3.34mm, $6.79mm, and $4.49mm in 2009, 2008, and 2007 
respectively.  This indicates that ABAT sales estimates are likely inflated.   
 
ZAP allegedly has a long history of exaggerating claims in press releases, taking advantage of 
investors, and various other sorts of foul play as described in an expose from Wired Magazine 
which can be found here:  “Hype Machine: Searching for ZAP’s Fleet of No-Show Green Cars”.  
 
We spoke with ZAP’s co-founder and came away further confident that ABAT is fabricating its 
financial statements. He said he had visited the Harbin facility twice – once last year and once 
three years ago – and also said he helped introduce ABAT’s founder Zhiguo Fu to Wuxi Angell. 
To be clear, he did not state that ABAT was fabricating its numbers. But reading between the 
lines, we drew the conclusion that he had his own suspicions about ABAT’s purported margins 
and growth.

When we asked whether he thought the Company’s numbers were real, he responded: “I can 
see his numbers are climbing like you said, and, who knows?” We pressed:  
 
Prescience: Listen, seriously, you’ve been there. Do you think it’s real? 


 
ZAP: Ah, well, yeah I know, there was that recent article in the Wall Street [Journal] that 


said that all these Chinese companies are faking their numbers. [chuckle]. Maybe 
you saw that a couple days ago. 
 


Prescience: I did see that. 
 


ZAP: Yeah, yeah, so that’s why I’m saying – I don’t know his real numbers. I knew that 
he grew, but I can’t tell you whether his numbers are real or not. 
 


 
At no point did he say that he believed ABAT was committing fraud. But we came away from the 
conversation further confident that ABAT was fabricating the financial figures in its SEC filings.  
 
Altair Nanotechnologies, Inc. of Reno, Nevada  
An agreement was entered into in which Altair would supply ABAT with nano-structured lithium 
spinel electrode materials in 2005. According to ABAT, “the inclusion of these nanomaterials in 
ZQ Power-Tech's batteries has significantly increased the power delivery and reduced the time 
required for recharge”. However, our conversation with the CEO of Altair reveals a different 
story:    
  


Altair: As I indicated we had signed an agreement in 2005 and at that time sold them 
some raw material and there literally were no further communications after some 
time in 2007.  To be quite honest with you they stiffed us on the payment. 
 


Prescience: They skipped payment? 
 


Altair: Yea, they didn’t pay the entire amount due. 
 


 
ECr Technologies of San Jose 
In 2005, the company signed a letter of intent to jointly develop an all-electric bus, for which 
ABAT would supply the batteries, battery management, and charging systems.  This company 
was headed by Samuel Romano, who had also founded the Georgetown University’s Advanced 
Vehicle Development Program. We could not locate the contact information for ECr 
Technologies, and Mr. Romano has since retired from Georgetown. We contacted Charlie 
Prizlaff, the program manager at the Advanced Vehicles team at Georgetown, who said he 
would forward our correspondence to Mr. Romano. But to date, we have not heard back.  
 
In addition to the US and other global companies above, ABAT purports to have (or have had) 
relationships with other Chinese companies.  Our investigations produced additional findings 
similar to those above. 
 


Aiyingsi Company of Taiwan (哈尔滨爱英斯汽车部件有限公司)  
As far back as 2004, ABAT was commenting on their relationship with Aiyingsi, and indicated 
that they had received an order for $21mm of 3.7 volt PLI battery sets.  Supposedly “shipments 
under that order were made to Aiyingsi commencing in 2006”.  The company could be found on 
the internet, but our investigator in China failed to contact Aiyingsi when she was told that the 
Aiyingsi phone had been disconnected.  We were able to find the following information about

Beijing Guoqiang Global Technology Development Co. Ltd. (强环球科技发展有限公司)  
ABAT claims to have supplied “3,000 battery sets for use in electric garbage trucks that were 
designed for the 2008 Olympics” between May 2007 and February 2008, for $10mm.  Our 
investigator in China was able to get in touch with the General Manager, but he refused to 
answer any questions unless we brought legal proof of our identities to Beijing.  However, our 
investigator commented that “from his tone, it is likely that he knew ABAT and once conducted 
business with ABAT”. 
 
U Long Run Sheng Technology Co. Ltd. 
In 2009, ABAT supposedly entered into an agreement to supply this company with $7.8mm of 
batteries.  However, nothing could be found out about this company.  No information could be 
found on the internet or in business directories, by us or our investigators in China. 
 
Harbin University of Science and Technology 
In 2005, ABAT contracted with the university to design the electrical controls and management 
systems for a sedan conversion using advanced nanotechnology electrode materials. We were 
unable to locate the correct person at the university to speak with about ABAT.  
 
Beijing Institute of Technology 
In 2005, ABAT contracted to develop and test four electric buses to be built by ABAT for the 
2008 Olympic Electric Bus program. We were unable to locate the correct person at the institute

CFO & Auditor Turnover 
 
In light of the substantial evidence that ABAT is a fraud, high CFO and auditor turnover can be 
considered as yet another symptom. On average, ABAT has lost either a CFO or auditor more 
than once per year. Below is a table documenting the Company’s CFO and auditor turnover: 
 


Date CFO Change Auditor Change 
9/14/2004 John C. Leo resigned,  


replaced by Guohua Wan 
 


9/27/2004  Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman & 
Company resigned,  
replaced by PKF Hong Kong SAR 


12/28/2006  PKF Hong Kong dismissed,  
replaced by Bagell, Josephs, Levine & 
Co., LLC 


4/20/2007 Guohua Wan resigned,  
replaced by Sharon Xiarong Tang 





5/13/2008 Sharon Xiaorong Tang resigned,  
replaced by Taylor Dahe Zhang 





3/1/2009 Taylor Dahe Zhang resigned,  
replaced by Guohua Wan (again) 





12/14/2010  Dismissed Friedman, LLP (Acquired 
Bagell),  
replaced with EFP Rotenberg, LLP 


 
Losing a CFO or auditor at least once a year is not normal; rather, it’s a sign of potential fraud.   
 
Furthermore, ABAT has made a mockery of the chief financial officer institution. Its CFOs since 
2004 have either been company insiders or highly unqualified to be the chief financial officer of 
an emerging global battery manufacturing powerhouse, which is what ABAT would be if its sales 
growth and profit margins were real. Below is a chart of the Company’s CFOs: 
 


Date Name Comments 
3/09-Present: Guohua Wan Previous CFO who has been a company insider since the 


company’s inception. Ms. Wan has been general manager 
of ZQ Power-Tech since 2003. 
 


5/08-3/09 Taylor Zhang 29-year-old who had received his MBA from the University 
of Florida two years before accepting ABAT’s CFO position. 
Prior to joining ABAT, Zhang was the VP of Finance at 
China Natural Gas, another U.S.-listed Chinese fraud.  
 


4/07-5/08 Sharon Tang From 1998 to 2006, Tang was a financial advisor at Smith 
Barney in New York. We don’t think that being a financial 
advisor at a brokerage firm provides the experience 
necessary to be the CFO of a Nasdaq-listed company with 
industry-leading margins and sales growth.  
 


9/04 to 4/07: Guohua Wan General manager of ZQ Power-Tech since company’s 
inception in 2003.  
 


Prior to 9/04: John Leo Temporary CFO following the Company’s reverse merger.

Ms. Guohua Wan is the current CFO and was also formerly CFO from September 2004 to April 
2007. She is a key company insider and has been general manager of Heilongjiang ZQ, the 
company’s main operating subsidiary, since the business’s inception. Her lack of independence 
and the fact that she is also the general manager of the Company’s main operating subsidiary is 
troubling.  
 
Prior to Ms. Wan, Taylor Dahe Zhang was only 29 years old when he was hired as ABAT’s 
CFO, and even he resigned in less than a year. Mr. Zhang was previously a Vice President of 
Finance at China Natural Gas, another U.S.-listed Chinese reverse merger fraud.  
 
Prior to Mr. Zhang, the Company’s CFO was Sharon Tang, who joined in April 2007. The vast 
majority of Ms. Tang’s experience prior to her post at ABAT constituted of being a financial 
adviser at Smith Barney from 1998 to 2006. We don’t think that being a financial advisor at a 
brokerage firm provides the experience necessary to be the CFO of a Nasdaq-listed company 
with industry-leading margins and sales growth. Ms. Tang lasted only 13 months on the job. 
Prior to Tang, the Company’s CFO was Guohua Wan, the company insider and current CFO 
previously discussed.  
 
The Company’s history of auditors has been equally disappointing. Below is a table listing 
ABAT’s history of auditors: 
 


Date Name Ranking within Global Top 100 
Auditors 


2010-Present EFP Rotenberg, LLP Unranked 
 


2006-2010 Bagell, Josephs, Levine & Co., 
LLC (which later merged into 
Friedman LLP) 
 


Unranked (Friedman LLP, however, was 
ranked #47) 
 


2004-2006 PKF Hong Kong Unranked 
 


2004 Rosenberg Rich Baker Berman & 
Co 


Unranked 
 


 
None of the Company’s auditors have been ranked in the top 100 global auditors at the time of 
ABAT’s hiring. Bagell, Josephs, Levine & Co., LLC was acquired by Friedman LLP in 2010, but 
Friedman resigned as ABAT’s auditor in less than a year.  
 
The Company’s current auditor is EFP Rotenberg. Rotenberg & Co., which merged with the 
EFP Group in 2009, received a PCAOB inspection in 2008 concluding the following: 
 


The inspection team identified what it considered to be audit deficiencies.  The 
deficiencies identified in one of the audits reviewed included a deficiency of such 
significance that it appeared to the inspection team that the Firm did not obtain sufficient 
competent evidential matter to support its opinion on the issuer's financial statements. 


 
The PCAOB is an independent third-party “nonprofit corporation established by Congress to 
oversee the audits of public companies in order to protect investors and the public interest by 
promoting informative, accurate, and independent audit reports”.   
 
Instead of hiring a top-4 auditor, or even a top-100 for that matter, ABAT chose EFP Rotenberg 
as its fourth auditor in six years. If ABAT was truly an emerging battery manufacturing

powerhouse, and actually did have the top operating profit margin by a wide margin out of all 
global battery makers, it would probably want to hire a top-4 auditor.  
 


Shareholder Dilution 
 
US-listed Chinese frauds make money by issuing shares to foreign investors.  If it wasn't for the 
fact that public investors are losing or stand to lose millions of dollars, the situation would be 
almost laughable.  Despite the fact that management is reporting more than enough cash on the 
balance sheet to fund operations and significant expansion and despite the fact that no 
responsible management team would sell shares in a fast-growing, high margin, cash-rich 
business for less than 12x earnings, ABAT issues shares on a very regular basis.   
 
On July 12, 2004, Buy It Cheap.com, Inc., which ABAT had recently reverse merged into, 
changed its name to Advanced Battery Technologies, Inc. and began to trade on the OTCBB 
under the ticker ABAT.  On this date, there were 1,984,258 shares outstanding plus Series D 
Preferred Stock which was to be converted into an additional 8,061,130 shares, for a total 
outstanding shares of 10.045 million shares.  ABAT simultaneously authorized an increase in 
the number of shares available to a maximum of 60 million shares. 
 
From here on out, management began diluting shareholders excessively.  They did this by 
issuing shares in public offerings, paying for acquisitions with shares, and paying management 
with shares.  The following is a timeline of major share dilutions and trailing earnings multiples:

We’ve also provided graphical depictions of ABAT’s egregious share dilution. Below is an 
annotated timeline demonstrating the Company’s share issuance:

Below is a graphical comparison of the share count to ABAT’s stock price and trailing price 
earnings ratio. As we can see, the heavy dilution has resulted in a stagnating stock price over 
the past few years despite the increased reported earnings, per Bloomberg:

32 





 
 
We can also see from this graph that ABAT has been issuing shares at irrationally low valuation 
multiples. For a company that supposedly grew revenue from $4.2 million in 2005 to $63.6 
million in 2009, paying even 15x earnings creates terrible dilution for shareholders.  Yet in its 
most recent capital raise, management was willing to sell shares for less than 12x trailing 
earnings.  If the capital was absolutely necessary to build out facilities, it might be justifiable.  
But over the same span of time, ABAT reportedly has grown cash from $18k to $53 million.  As 
of the third quarter, it had a cash balance of $74.3 million.  It's hard to argue they needed more 
cash.  Likewise, PP&E has grown from $11.9 million to $47.2 million and intangibles have grown 
from $528k to $14.3 million.  Therefore, for every dollar either raised in the capital markets or 
earned, only fifty cents was spent.  And with only $21.8 million of purported operating cash flow 
between 2005 and 2009, we can guess where most of the money came from: US investors.   
 
The most recent offering, which management expects will raise between $28.4 million and 
$42.7 million, offered no insight into how the money would be spent.  Specifically, the 
prospectus states: 
 


We intend to use the net proceeds received from the sale of the securities for further 
development of our existing product lines and other general corporate purposes. We 
cannot estimate precisely the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. The 
amounts and timing of the expenditures may vary significantly, depending on numerous 
factors. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the 
net proceeds of this offering.  


 
This degree of share dilution is completely unjustifiable.  Even the most forgiving shareholder 
can only draw the conclusion that management has continually ignored its fiduciary 
responsibility to investors since day one.  Any rational investor, realizing that this is how frauds

steal money, would look at this track record and see a smoking gun.  Not coincidentally, the 
most recent announcement of share dilution dropped the stock price by 12.4% in a single day.

Conclusion 
 
Fraud is not an American problem or a Chinese problem – it's a greed problem that arises when 
trust or hope replace critical thinking. We will review the key facts once more:   
 


• SAIC filings show that ABAT is reporting significantly lower revenue and operating losses to the 
authorities in China. For 2009, SAIC filings showed less than $2 million of revenue, compared to 
$64 million in SEC filings.  


• ABAT has unreasonably high margins in an established industry with strong competitors.  The 
Company’s SEC-reported margins and return on capital are virtually impossible. Out of 106 global 
battery manufacturers as classified by Bloomberg, ABAT has the highest operating profit margin 
by a wide margin. When compared to six leading Chinese battery makers, ABAT’s operating 
margin is triple that of its closest competitor and six times that of the median operating margin of 
the comparable companies. 


• Site visits show underutilized facilities lacking in quality control. We hired investigators to visit 
both the Harbin and Wuxi facilities, and provide photos as well as commentary from our 
investigators. Our investigators concluded that both facilities produce commodity, low-margin 
products that are highly unlikely to be generating industry-leading margins or return on capital. 


• In December 2010, ABAT announced that it was acquiring a Shenzhen battery maker for $20 
million. We believe this acquisition is a sham, and that ABAT paid $20 million in 2010 for an entity 
that they had previously bought in 2008 for $1 million, but had not disclosed to public investors. 


• Confirmation from former customers and partners that the Company is likely a fraud. After visiting 
one of ABAT’s plants, one customer called the facility “absolutely the biggest joke I’d ever seen”. 
A recording of the conversation is available here. In another conversation available here and 
here, a customer said the CEO admitted to hiring an accounting firm "to cook his stock price up". 


• Low quality auditors and high turnover. The company has had 4 auditors in the past 7 years, with 
no auditor being ranked in the top global 100 auditors at the time of hire.  


• Unqualified CFOs and high turnover. A CFO or auditor has resigned at least once a year. The 
Company’s past three CFOs have included: (i) a company insider who has been general 
manager of the Company’s main operating subsidiary since 2004, and is therefore not remotely 
independent, (ii) a 29-year-old who was formerly VP Finance at China Natural Gas, another 
fraud, and (iii) a candidate whose primary experience comprised of being a financial adviser at 
Smith Barney.  


• Continuous share dilution through secondary offerings, despite having more than adequate cash 
reserves. Through repeated share issuances, the Company has grown its outstanding shares 
from 10.0 million following the 2004 reverse merger to 76.4 million today.  





 
ABAT management has lied on their financial statements. The fabrications are so extraordinary 
that ABAT appears to be the single most productive and efficient battery manufacturer in the 
world, despite its small economies of scale and relative obscurity. The information provided to 
investors regarding customers, partners, and suppliers has been tracked, and in many 
circumstances has led to a dead-end or a ruined relationship. The fraud hypothesis is 
furthermore supported by the long list of CFOs and accountants, a sham acquisition in 
December 2010, as well as the never-ending share dilution for no clear purpose.
