Re: HLSS Servicer Advance Receivables Trust Supplemental Notice of Default Supplemental
Notice of Event of Default Supplemental Notice of Facility Early Amortiation Event


Ladies and Gentlemen:


We write on behalf of our client BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC, as investment
manager to BlueMountain Montenvers Master Fund SCA SICAV-SIF, BlueMountain Guadalupe
Peak Fund L.P., and Blue Mountain Credit Alternatives Master Fund L.P. (collectively,
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Second Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-second-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-ad


"BlueMountain"), which own certain Series 2012-T2 and Series 2013-T3 Notes issued in
connection with the HLSS Servicer Advance Receivables Trust (the "HSART Trust").  We write in
reference to the Sixth Amended and Restated Indenture, dated as of January 17, 2014,
including all Schedules and Exhibits thereto (the "Indenture"), by and among the HSART Trust,
as Issuer, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company ("DBNT"), as Indenture Trustee, Calculation
Agent, Paying Agent and Securities Intermediary, HLSS Holdings, LLC ("HLSS"), as Administrator
and as Servicer (on and after the MSR Transfer Date), Ocwen Loan Servicing, LLC ("Ocwen"), as a
Subservicer and as Servicer (prior to the MSR Transfer Date), Barclays Bank PLC, as
Administrative Agent, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, as Administrative Agent, and Credit Suisse
AG, New York Branch, as Administrative Agent, and all agreements referenced therein,
including without limitation all the Designated Servicing Agreements and Transaction
Documents.  Unless otherwise speci�ed, capitalized terms used but not de�ned in this letter
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Indenture.


We write to supplement the notice of Events of Default that BlueMountain served on January
23, 2015 (the "January 23 Letter") with two subsequent occurrences that constitute incremental
Events of Default under the Indenture.  Speci�cally, the recent downgrades of Ocwen's servicer
rating by Moody's Investors Service, Inc. ("Moody's") and Fitch Ratings, Inc. ("Fitch") automatically
gave rise to defaults and termination events in agreements governing Ocwen's mortgage
servicing rights that collateralize the obligations of the HSART Trust to the Noteholders.  Those
defaults and termination events, in turn, resulted in Events of Default under the Indenture.[1] 
The increased risk of loss stemming from the occurrence of these Events of Default provides
additional grounds to implement the bargained-for contractual remedy of an increase in the
Note Interest Rate by 3%.


The two Events of Default discussed in this letter are independent of, yet also reinforce, the
Events of Default recited in the January 23 Letter.  The January 23 Letter asked the Indenture
Trustee to enforce the Noteholders' contractual remedy to address the precise conduct by
Ocwen that HLSS and Ocwen acknowledged in the offering memorandum for the HSART Trust
posed a material risk of loss to the Noteholders.  Ocwen's admitted misconduct has caused a
succession of materially negative outcomes (e.g., governmental investigations, the appointment
of monitors and third-party auditors, ratings downgrades) that entitle the Noteholders to the
relief sought in the prior and instant notices.  The previously-noticed Events of Default remain
valid, and no determination has yet been made regarding their merits by the Indenture Trustee
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Second Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-second-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-ad


or any Court.  However, because both notices are predicated on irrefutable facts in the public
domain and the plain reading of the governing agreements, we expect the Indenture Trustee
to render a determination in the near term.


The January 23 Letter


The January 23 Letter provided notice of Events of Default pursuant to Sections 8.1(d), 8.1(g), and
8.1(m)(i) of the Indenture.  These Events of Default were predicated upon facts "stipulate[d]" and
"agree[d]" to by Ocwen that, among other things, it had engaged in "numerous and signi�cant"
violations of New York law, had "inadequate and ineffective technology systems and
personnel," and "regularly gives borrowers incorrect or outdated information, sends borrowers
backdated letters, unreliably tracks data for investors, and maintains inaccurate records."[2] 
BlueMountain requested implementation of the "express and reasoned remedy to compensate
the Noteholders for the increased risk of loss associated with the speci�ed Events of Default: 
an increased rate of return."[3]  Under the terms of the Indenture, the increased Note Interest
Rate was due on the next scheduled Payment Date of February 17, 2015.[4]  In advance of the
February 17 Payment Date, however, DBNT represented to BlueMountain's counsel that it had
not made any determination as to the merits of the Events of Default asserted in the January
23 Letter, and that it had not formally or informally solicited opinions from any Noteholders
concerning the matter.  DBNT stated that, due to these considerations, it required additional
time, beyond the February 17 Payment Date, to ful�ll its duties as Indenture Trustee to evaluate
the merits of the January 23 Letter. 


To afford DBNT a reasonable opportunity to perform its duties, BlueMountain allowed DBNT to
delay making a determination as to the merits of BlueMountain's claims until after the
February 17 Payment Date.  BlueMountain agreed to DBNT's request to reserve the higher
interest payment due with respect to the February 17 Payment Date only.  Speci�cally,
BlueMountain informed DBNT that it "does not object to the Trustee withholding and reserving
—in lieu of distributing the Incremental Interest Payment to the Noteholders on the next
Payment Date—funds in the amount of the Incremental Interest Payment due for the period
from and including January 23, 2015 through February 17, 2015, with the understanding that
the funds withheld shall be deducted from amounts that would otherwise be distributed to
[HLSS]."[5]  BlueMountain agreed to DBNT's request even though the Events of Default
speci�ed in the January 23 Letter are predicated on irrefutable facts in the public domain and
the determination of the propriety of the relief requested by BlueMountain is straightforward.

https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-second-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-ad


BlueMountain also informed DBNT that it "will consider additional requests, if any, by the
Trustee to consent to the withholding and reserving—in lieu of distributing—of Incremental
Interest Payments for future Payment Dates in view of the facts and circumstances as they exist
at that time."[6]  Independent of the agreement with BlueMountain, the Trustee secured HLSS's
consent to the withholding and reserving by the Trustee of higher interest payment amounts
from funds that otherwise would have been distributed to HLSS.  Neither the BlueMountain
nor the HLSS agreement with the Trustee is a decision on the merits of the January 23 Letter, or
relieves the Trustee of its obligation to timely address the noticed Events of Default.


The Downgrades


Since the January 23 Letter, Ocwen's servicing operations were subject to two recent rating
downgrades.  First, on January 29, 2015, Moody's downgraded Ocwen's "servicer quality (SQ)
assessments as a primary servicer of subprime residential mortgage loans to SQ3- from SQ3
and as a special servicer of residential mortgage loans to SQ3- from SQ3."[7]  Second, on
February 4, 2015, Fitch downgraded Ocwen's servicer ratings as follows:  (i) Ocwen's residential
primary servicer rating for Prime, Alt-A, Subprime, HELOC, and Closed-end Second Lien
products to "RPS4" from "RPS3"; (ii) Ocwen's residential special servicer rating to "RSS4" from
"RSS3"; and (iii) Ocwen's master servicer rating to "RMS4" from "RMS3."[8]  The reduction in
Ocwen's servicing rating to the levels of the Moody's and Fitch downgrades (together, the
"Downgrades") provides an objective measure of a material increase in risk associated with
Ocwen's servicing operations.  Home Loan Servicing Solutions, Ltd. ("HLSS Ltd.") also recognized
as much in its recent press release, which noted that Ocwen's "ability . . . to maintain its
residential mortgage servicer ratings" is an "[i]mportant factor[] that could cause actual results
to differ materially" from the company's "forward looking statements."[9]  Accordingly, as
detailed below, the Designated Servicing Agreements and Transaction Documents state that
such Downgrades shall automatically, without further inquiry, give rise to events of defaults and
termination events, which in turn, constitute Events of Default under Sections 8.1(d) and 8.1(m)
(i) of the Indenture. 


Section 8.1(d)


Under Section 8.1(d) of the Indenture, an Event of Default occurs when "the Servicer . . .  shall
materially breach or default in the due observance or performance of any of its covenants or
agreements in this Indenture or any other Transaction Document (subject to any cure period
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Second Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-second-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-ad


provided therein) . . . ."[10]  The Receivables Sale Agreement is a Transaction Document.[11]  In
Section 4 of the Receivables Sale Agreement, Ocwen made a series of covenants, including a
covenant titled "Default."[12]  Therein, Ocwen covenanted that—through to the date on which
Ocwen "shall sell to HLSS all of the servicing rights and obligations under [the] Designated
Servicing Agreement" (the "MSR Transfer Date"),[13] which has not occurred—it "is not in default
. . . under any material agreement . . . including without limitation, each Designated Servicing
Agreement, excluding those as a result of a breach of a Collateral Performance Test in respect
of which no notice of termination has been sent[]."[14]  Ocwen further covenanted that "[e]ach
Designated Servicing Agreement, as amended, is in full force and effect and no default (other
than such an event resulting solely from the failure of a Collateral Performance Test under the
related Servicing Agreement) exists thereunder . . . ."[15] 


A signi�cant number of Designated Servicing Agreements have events of default or servicer
termination events as a result of the Downgrades.  Ocwen Financial Corporation recently
reported that out of the "approximately 4,000 private label securities (PLS) agreements" it
currently services, "[t]o date, including the recent announcement from Fitch, our servicer
ratings have fallen below the minimum criteria set forth in 482 PLS agreements."[16]  This
represents approximately 12% of the PLS agreements serviced by Ocwen, and includes a
material number of Designated Servicing Agreements.


The minimum rating criteria in the Designated Servicing Agreements validate the Downgrades
as an objective measure of a material increase in the risk of loss already realized with respect to
Ocwen's servicing operations.  Moreover, the right to terminate Ocwen as a servicer under
Designated Servicing Agreements as a consequence of the Downgrades creates incremental
risk of loss to the Noteholders.  As recited in the January 23 Letter, Ocwen and HLSS
acknowledged in the offering memorandum for the HSART Trust that terminations "may result
in delays or interruptions in payments on the Notes" and that the "yield on [the] Notes may be
impacted."[17]  For all these reasons, the Downgrades have triggered defaults in the Designated
Servicing Agreements, which, in turn, have caused additional Events of Default under Section
8.1(d) of the Indenture.


Section 8.1(m)(i)
5/18/2018 BlueMountain Capital Management, LLC Delivers Second Notice of Default on Certain Notes to Trustee


https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/bluemountain-capital-management-llc-delivers-second-notice-of-default-on-certain-notes-to-trustee-of-the-hlss-servicer-ad


Under Section 8.1(m)(i) of the Indenture, an Event of Default occurs when there is "an event of
default under any full-recourse, term loan facility under which a Subservicer, HLSS or [HLSS
Ltd.] is borrower, including, without limitation, the loan facility evidenced by that certain Senior
Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement."[18]  The Downgrades gave rise to additional Events of
Default under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement, as follows:


Ocwen is the borrower and a Loan Party under the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility
Agreement. See Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement § 1.01 (de�nition of "Loan
Party").
Section 8.01(e) of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility Agreement, titled "Default in
Other Agreements," provides that an Event of Default arises upon the occurrence of,
among other things, the "breach or default by any Loan Party with respect to any other
material term of . . . any loan agreement, mortgage, indenture or other agreement relating
to such item(s) of Indebtedness, in each case beyond the grace period, if any, provided
therefor, if the effect of such breach or default is to cause, or to permit the holder or
holders of that Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder or holders), to cause,
that Indebtedness to become or be declared due and payable (or redeemable) prior to its
stated maturity or the stated maturity of any underlying obligation, as the case may be."
Id. § 8.01(e)(ii)(2).
The Master Servicing Rights Purchase Agreement and each related Sale Supplement[19]
are items of Indebtedness under Section 8.01(e) of the Senior Secured Term Loan Facility
Agreement.[20]
The Downgrades constitute Termination Events under each Sale Supplement.[21] Upon
the occurrence of a Termination Event, HLSS obtains the right to direct Ocwen to sell its
mortgage servicing rights to pay amounts due to HLSS.[22] Other market participants
seem to suggest that the Termination Events do not afford Ocwen's other secured lenders
similar rights, and therefore, proceeds from a sale of Ocwen's rights will bene�t HLSS
exclusively.[23] To the contrary, the Termination Events trigger a cross-default under the
Senior Secured Loan Facility Agreement, which entitles the participating lenders to
accelerate Ocwen's debt (among other remedies).[24] Moreover, under the loan facility,
the participating lenders may make claims to the proceeds from the servicing transfer.[25]


In summary, the Downgrades gave rise to a Termination Event in each of the Sales
Supplements, which gave rise to an Event of Default under the Senior Secured Term Loan
Facility Agreement, thus constituting an Event of Default under the Indenture.[26]
