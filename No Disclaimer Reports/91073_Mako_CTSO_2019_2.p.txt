On August 15, the day my prior article was published on Seeking Alpha,
Cytosorbents put out a PR saying it had received renewal of its CE Mark through
May 2024.


The May 2024 expiry date and other evidence strongly suggest that the CE Mark
was renewed under the old Medical Device Directive ((MDD)) and not the new
Medical Device Regulation.


The CytoSorb will still need to be re-certified under the MDR by May 2024 to retain
access to the European market.


This is a brief follow-up to my last article about Cytosorbents (NASDAQ:CTSO). The day
it was published, the company put out a press release:

MONMOUTH JUNCTION, N.J., Aug. 15, 2019 /PRNewswire/ — CytoSorbents
Corporation (NASDAQ: CTSO), a critical care immunotherapy leader using its
CytoSorb blood purification technology to treat deadly inflammation in critically-ill and
cardiac surgery patients around the world, announced that CytoSorb has received
renewal of its European Union CE Mark through May 2024 and ISO 13485:2016
Full Quality Assurance System certification of its manufacturing facility
through September 2022.


CytoSorbents Logo. (PRNewsFoto/CytoSorbents) Mr. Vincent Capponi, Chief
Operating Officer of CytoSorbents stated, “I am happy to announce CytoSorbents
successfully completed its CE Mark and ISO13485:2016 re-certification audits. These
certificates cover CytoSorb and our new manufacturing facility commissioned in June
2018. The success of this renewal of the CE Mark and recent audit is a reflection of
CytoSorbents’ ongoing commitment to quality. I am very proud of our quality,
manufacturing, and research teams that contributed to these accomplishments.”


The May 2024 date immediately got my attention- it appears a few times in the
Factsheet for manufacturers of medical devices with EU Medical Device Regulation:


The MDR will replace the existing Medical Devices Directive (93/42/EEC) (MDD) and
the Active Implantable Medical Devices Directive (90/385/EEC) (AIMDD). The MDR
was published in May 2017, marking the start of a three-year period of transition from
the MDD and the AIMDD. During the transitional period the MDR will come into force
gradually, starting with the provisions related to the designation of Notified Bodies
and the ability of manufacturers to apply for new certificates under the MDR. The
transitional period will end on 26 May 2020, the “Date of Application” ((DoA)) of the
Regulation. From that date the MDR will apply fully. To avoid market disruption and
allow a smooth transition from the Directives to the Regulation, several transitional
provisions are in place (Article 120). Some devices with certificates issued under
the Directives (AIMDD/MDD certificates) may continue to be placed on the
market until 27 May 2024, and made available until 27 May 2025. During the
transition phase, products certified under the Directives and products certified under
the Regulation will coexist on the market. Both will have equal status under the law,
and no discrimination in public tenders may take place.

https://ec.europa.eu/docsroom/documents/31201
As a manufacturer, the timing of your transition to the MDR is up to you. From 26
May 2020, all new certificates will have to be delivered according to the
Regulation. The certificates delivered under the Directives can be valid until
their date of validity for a maximum of four years (27 May 2024 at the latest).
However, in the latter case, the requirements of the new Regulation relating to post-
market surveillance, market surveillance, vigilance, and the registration of economic
operators and devices shall apply from the Date of Application (Article 120 paragraph
3)...


Yes, AIMDD/MDD certificates will generally remain valid until their indicated expiry
dates. This applies to all the certificates commonly issued by Notified Bodies,
including the EC Design-Examination Certificates, Certificates of Conformity, EC Type
Examination Certificates, the EC Certificate Full Quality Assurance System, and the
EC Certificate Production Quality Assurance. However, all certificates issued
after 25 May 2017 will be void at the latest by 27 May 2024. After this date there
will be no more valid AIMDD/MDD certificates.


There is an unfortunate lack of transparency in the EU when it comes to medical device
regulation, which is something which the new regulations are intended to address.
There is no publicly accessible EU-wide database of registered medical devices, but
Italian Ministry of Health has a searchable web page and the French ANSM has a
downloadable excel file containing a list of registered medical devices. The web pages
are in Italian and French, of course. I wasn’t able find the Cytosorb on the Italian page,
and believe the French excel file has the relevant piece of information – see the
screenshot below:

It appears to me that the Cytosorb CE Mark was renewed under the MDD in September
2018 and thus the company extended its certification under the old regulations until the
last possible date (May 27 , 2024). The company will still face all the challenges of
renewing the device under the MDR and will still lose access to the European market in
2024 if it can’t provide sufficient evidence of safety and efficacy to satisfy the new, more
stringent requirements for re-certification.

The Cytosorbents PR linked above notes that “CytoSorb has been used in more than
67,000 treatments, up from 46,000 a year ago.” After 7+ years on the market in
Europe and 67,000 treatments, the company still does not have definitive
evidence that the Cytosorb is both safe and effective. It also still has not yet been
approved by the FDA, which has been a stated goal of the company since 2006.


Nothing fundamental has changed, but the can has been kicked down the road. I now
believe that revenue could decline 70%+ in May 2024.


In the meantime, Cytosorbents will continue to lose money. Bulls may think that the
company is temporarily unprofitable because it is investing in Research and
Development, but SG&A expense has been more than double R&D over the last 12
months. In fact, SG&A expense has been greater than gross profit for every single
year since the reverse merger in 2005.
