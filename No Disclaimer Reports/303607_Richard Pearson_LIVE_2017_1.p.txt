Summary
From November to December, Live Ventures tripled on the back of aggressive paid
promotions. Promoters have been paid as much as $2 million to hype Live
Ventures.
Same promoters as imploded fraud Force�eld Energy which was delisted and went
to zero. Latest LIVE bull was permanently barred by the SEC for “egregious” stock
fraud.
Company created “earnings” via multiple one time discretionary accounting gains.
Auditor was cited in 2016 for egregious and extensive audit de�ciencies.
Company’s recent acquisition of “Vintage Stock” is effectively a continuation of
now bankrupt Blockbuster, and has actually acquired its locations from
Blockbuster and bankrupt Borders.
Live Ventures has just $770,000 in cash remaining.

Name: Live Ventures (NASDAQ:LIVE (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/LIVE))


Inst. Ownership: 3%


Short Interest: 85,000 shares (3% of outstanding)


Cash Balance: $770,000 (28 cents per share)


52 week low: $6.00


Introduction


I �rst became aware of Live Ventures a few years ago when I was investigating and exposing an illegal stock
promotion �rm called The Dream Team Group. At the time, the company was known as Live Deal and one of
the Dream Team promoters was moonlighting, also writing for another stock promotion �rm. That �rm was
looking to recruit writers to write undisclosed paid promotions on Live Ventures.


My �rst article at the time exposed the Dream Team and their two primary promotions, Galena
(NASDAQ:GALE (http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/GALE)) and CytRx (NASDAQ:CYTR
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CYTR)). I then followed up with various other articles exposing many other
related stock promotions. A few of them were stocks which I had shorted, but with many more of them, I
highlighted their problems just for the sake of cleaning up the market, even though I had no �nancial interest.


As expected, nearly all of these promotions (once exposed) fell by at least 90%. Executives resigned. SEC
investigations ensued. Shareholder lawsuits were �led. Some have been delisted outright and gone to zero.


As always, there had been volumes of supposed “analysis” of each of these companies’ business prospects.
And, of course, in each case, the business appeared to be compelling. But as is always the case, whenever I
�nd evidence of the individuals, promotion �rms and tactics of stock promotions, these businesses ALWAYS
end up failing. The purported business descriptions and developments are nothing more than manufactured
fantasy. They are designed to sound great for the sole purpose of luring in retail investors. And then they fail.


In the end, there were still many other stocks which I had come across but which I never got around to writing
about. In some cases, the stocks were too small and illiquid for anyone to care. In other cases, they traded for
just a few pennies. And in some cases, I simply had too little information at the time to merit a full report.


But over time, some of these legacy stock promotions rear their heads again, so I do try to keep my eye on
them. Live Ventures is one of those stocks.


As with the others, I will demonstrate clearly the view that Live Ventures is nothing more than a paid stock
promotion with negligible business prospects. Investors have been grossly misled into bidding up the stock
price by several hundred percent in just a few weeks. As investors see the true background facts, I expect the
stock to quickly implode just like the others.


Preview of this report


There are so many blatant problems behind the promotion of Live Ventures that it is di�icult to know where to
start.


I will break this report down into the following Parts:


PART A – THE ONGOING PAID PROMOTIONS, INCLUDING THROUGH DECEMBER 2016.

7/5/2019 Short LIVE. Massive Paid Promotions, Heavy Accounting Manipulation, Deficient Auditor And More - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 3/28


Here I will show how millions of dollars have been paid to some of the most notorious stock promotion �rms
which happen to still be operating. Live Ventures is being promoted by the same �rms I have exposed in the
past and who were responsible for the promotion of stocks such as Force�eld Energy (NASDAQ:FNRG
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FNRG)), among others. Following my exposure of Force�eld, the stock fell
by 60% within days. The Chairman was promptly arrested by the FBI as he tried to �ee the country. The stock
was then halted and delisted, going to zero all within a few trading days.


I will show how these �rms often interact with one another to obscure the nature of the ultimate paying party
for the promotions. Buried deep in the disclosures, we can see that the promoters end up admitting to us that
they are being paid to present deliberately skewed information for the sole purpose of making stock prices
rise. The promoters have explicitly noted that stock prices typically rise sharply during their promotions
campaigns, at which time they sell their own shares into the hype. Again, the information is hard to �nd, but in
order to absolve themselves of liability, the promoters warn that most investors who invest during their
campaigns will lose most or all of their money when the stock prices crash. Additional warnings (included
below) should generate similar levels of concern. Wherever possible, I include the stock promotion �rms
involved as well as the dollar amounts they have been paid.


These promotions have been ongoing even through the month of December, even on the last day or two
before the stock exploded to over $30. But now the paid promotions appear to have come to an end. The
share price has been falling almost every day since earnings were released, even on light volume. Without a
promotion in place, there simply aren’t buyers willing to support the stock.


Anyone who buys into the stock with this knowledge is deliberately signing up to lose money into the hands of
professional stock promoters who know that the stock is about to collapse. Buying Live Ventures under such
circumstances is literally downright idiotic.


PART B -LIVE BULL MICHAEL J. MARKOWSKI (BARRED BY SEC FOR “EGREGIOUS” FRAUD)


In Part B I show how Michael Markowski became an aggressive “bull” on Live Ventures just beginning in
November 2016, right as the simultaneous paid promotion began to take o� and the stock price began to
triple. Mr. Markowski has now written on Live Ventures 9 times in less than 6 weeks. He dramatically urges
investors to buy “at market” – not using limit prices and “recommends” continued purchases even as the price
went higher and higher. Mr. Markowski assures investors that Live Ventures will soar to as high as $180 (a 9
bagger from current levels) during 2017. Perhaps his perfect timing on getting involved with Live Ventures was
pure coincidence. Or perhaps not.


Many of the statements included in Markowski’s articles are �at out wrong. Yet investors have relied upon this
inaccurate information to buy shares of Live Ventures at ever higher prices. Details on these inaccurate
statements are provided below.


Mr. Markowski regularly touts his deep and lengthy expertise in the securities industry acquired over 40 years
in the business. But he blatantly fails to disclose that the SEC charged him with a host of securities fraud
violations which it described as being so “egregious” that barring him from the industry was “in the public
interest”.


The SEC noted that


Markowski’s conduct was egregious. The complaint in the injunctive action describes the manner in
which Markowski knowingly and recklessly manipulated the market prices of three Global-backed
securities, including aggressive and fraudulent sales practices, unlawful solicitation of aftermarket
orders during initial public o�erings, and delayed execution of the sell orders of Global customers.

https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 4/28


In other words, Markowski would use fraudulent means to induce customers to buy securities at manipulated
prices and then his brokerage would prevent them from executing their sell orders (sometimes for months)
even as the stocks plunged.


This is eerily similar to the content of his recent articles in which he keeps urging investors to buy “at market”
and then to buy more even after the stock tripled. Investors are strongly urged to never sell.


In determining a permanent bar on Markowski, the SEC noted that:


Markowski has provided no credible assurance against future violations. Indeed, Markowski’s
testimony bespeaks a complete lack of understanding of, and appreciation for, the regulatory scheme
governing the securities industry.


The vast, vast majority of individuals in the securities industry will never have any sort of violation on in their
history whatsoever. When the very rare person does, they will be penalized. A bar from the industry is a truly
rare occurrence reserved for the worst of the worst violators in the business where the SEC feels it needs to
protect investors from their further behavior.


PART C – THE INACCURATE “PROMOTION FODDER”


All promotions need some sort of talking points to get investors excited. These can often be acquisitions or
other corporate events. The “fodder” is then echoed and ampli�ed by the company in its press releases and
then further hyped and promoted by stock promoters.


Live Ventures has put out multiple press releases touting tremendous new developments. In fact, we can see
that the information that is touted in their press releases does not match what the company has disclosed to
the SEC.


Live Ventures states that Isaac Capital Group (which is solely controlled by Live Ventures’ CEO Jon Isaac)
has locked up “ALL” of its shares for 5 years, implying that the CEO cannot sell his shares.


Yet in addition to the 800,000 shares which have supposedly been locked up, Isaac has access to around
700,000 additional shares via warrants / options which have average exercise prices as low as $4.14 and
which expire in less than 2 years. THE WARRANTS ARE EXCERCISEABLE IMMEDIATELY – meaning that
Isaac can exercise and sell over $10 million of stock any time he wants.


Live Ventures put out a press release claiming that the company achieved EPS of $8.92 in 2016. This
is WRONG and is inconsistent with Live Ventures’ SEC �lings.


First o�, the $8.92 which was touted in Live Venture’s press release was calculated by subtracted the 800,000
shares which Isaac agreed to lock up. This is wrong. Even in its own SEC 10K �ling, Live is not able to
calculate EPS this way. The number as shown in the 10K is actually $5.40. So Live Ventures has already
overstated its EPS in the press release by 65%.


In fact, anyone running a text search on the 10K for the number “$8.92” will �nd no hits at all.


But then it gets better. Live Ventures didn’t even realize a true pro�t at all. Live Ventures LOST MONEY. The
GAAP Net Income number provided the company was $17.8 million. But to achieve this, the company added
in almost $19 million of arbitrary one time accounting adjustments, some of which appear to have no
precedent in public company accounting. So in fact, Live Ventures did not post a true pro�t at all – instead,
Live Ventures actually lost nearly $2 million.


These one time arbitrary adjustments (made at the company’s own discretion), are broken down in detail
below.

https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 5/28


Our barred “bull” Markowski has tried to spin these bizarre adjustments as a positive for Live Ventures. He
has also speci�cally assured us that


Before conducting any additional analysis, I checked out its auditor. I discovered that it was Anton
Chia, which is one of the most respected and SEC approved auditing �rms.”


In fact, Anton & Chia is not even a top 50 audit �rm. It was just cited (in September 2016) by the PCAOB for
multiple egregious audit de�ciencies, including failure to conduct proper audits in accordance with GAAP
(which is exactly what I see at Live Ventures). The �rm’s client list has heavy inclusion of imploded China/Asia
reveres merger bulletin board stocks which trade for just pennies. Some no longer trade at all and have failed
to �le with the SEC. And oh, by the way, the SEC does not “approve” audit �rms at all. Ever. That is not what
they do. So once again, the information Markowski uses in urging investors to place “market orders” is
egregiously wrong. The information on Anton & Chia is publicly available and easy to �nd with just a 5 minute
Google search.


In November, Live Ventures announced an acquisition of “Vintage Stock” which it touted was going to bring in
massive revenues to the company and involve no dilution. Given the two press releases above, investors
have every right to be skeptical. Within weeks, the company was already making large downward revisions in
its projections.


Until we see a detailed 8K for the acquisition, we have no idea what to expect from this acquisition. (Although
I do provide more detail on Vintage below).


PART A – THE “USUAL SUSPECTS” AND WHAT THEY ARE HIDING


Live Ventures’ stock has shown a repeated pattern over time. When the stock trades at a very low price, a
reverse split occurs to raise the price up and reduce the �oat. At the same time, some new acquisition or
corporate development is announced. Simultaneous paid promotions (which have now run into the millions of
dollars) help to temporarily drive the stock up. But when the business fails to produce results, the stock price
falls again and the process is repeated.


The most recent promotion campaign saw the stock triple in November to December 2016.


As in the past, there was a reverse split which coincided with some sort of “news”. As in the past, there is the
presence of heavily compensated stock promoters. And as in the past, the stock price quickly showed a
reaction, tripling in a few weeks.


Over time, stock promoters are getting more sophisticated. In the past, their hyped-up promo material would
sit out in cyberspace for extended periods of time, even after the promotions ended. This would simply
provide ammunition for people like me to discredit the promotions as the stock prices began their inevitable
implosions.


But now the promoters have often wised up. Their promotions usually go up on specialty sites designed just
for the promotion. The promotion material is then removed once the stock price soars. After all, once the stock
price rises and they dump their stock, there is no ongoing bene�t to maintaining a permanent record of the
promotion.


In other cases, stock promoters use huge email blasts to millions of retail investors. Because they do not
appear on web sites, the information behind these promotions is usually untraceable.


Fortunately, there are some of us out there who sign up for as many promo emails and sites as possible and
then store all of the emails.

And also in some rare cases we can still track down the occasional promotion that has not yet been deleted,
such as the one below. (I have saved pdf copies of this because I expect the material to be deleted).


This one (“Stock Market Leader”) comes from the promotion last dated December 27th, 2016
(http://stockmarketleader.com/new-nasdaq-alert-live/). So just a few days ago. Note that this is just before the
stock soared and that the promoter was paid $15,000.

up the stock by promoters who know that the stock is going to decrease when the short term

Ultimate Stock Alerts, ProTrader Elite and Goldman Small Cap Research


Shown above are promotions from Ultimate Stock Alerts and a variety of a�iliated stock promotion �rms tied
to Pro Trader Elite LLC. Live Ventures (and formerly Live Deal) have also been frequent promotions tied to
“Goldman Small Cap Research”. GSCR is a “paid for” research �rm which touts microcaps and which has no
connection to Goldman Sachs. People pay Goldman to write favorable reports. That’s GSCR does.


I highlighted both Ultimate Stock Alerts and Goldman Small Cap in this exposé on the promotion behind
fraudulent Force�eld Energy. Both Ultimate and Goldman were paid to promote Force�eld. Following my
article, the stock was quickly delisted and went to zero. The Chairman and 8 others were imprisoned following
their indictment in this $100 million fraud.


ForceField Energy: Undisclosed Promotions And Management Connections To Past Frauds
(http://seekingalpha.com/article/3071896-force�eld-energy-undisclosed-promotions-and-management-
connections-to-past-frauds)


We can also see that these promoters use a maze of paying parties to obscure who is really behind the
promotion. Many times, seemingly independent promotions all tie back to ProTrader Elite, which then uses a
variety of di�erent names.


My favorite is “Small Cap Firm (http://smallcap�rm.com/disclaimer/)“. Small Cap Firm gets paid by ProTrader
Elite to sub-run additional promotions using the same information.


It took me days of digging to �nd this, but ultimately I was able to �nd an “orphan” page which does not
appear to be linked to anything else, which describes how the promotions work and how they will a�ect
investors. Click here (http://smallcap�rm.com/disclaimer/) to read the whole thing. But here are a few
examples.


Again, these all tie back to �rms (such as ProTrader Elite) which work together along with the �rms
who are currently receiving millions of dollars in order to promote Live Ventures.


What will happen to the shares that we hold during the Campaign?


We will sell the shares we hold while we tell investors to purchase during the Campaign.

What will happen when the Campaign ends?


Most, if not all, of the Pro�led Issuers are penny stocks that are illiquid (they do not have much trading
volume at all) and whose securities are subject to wide �uctuations in trading price and volume. During
the Campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each Pro�le Issuer will likely increase
signi�cantly. When the Campaign ends, the volume and price of the Pro�led Issuer will likely
decrease dramatically. As a result, investors who purchase during the Campaign and hold
shares of the Pro�led Issuer when the Campaign ends will probably lose most, if not all, of
their investment.


Why do we publish only favorable Information?


We only publish favorable information because we are compensated to publish only favorable
information.


Is the Information complete, accurate, truthful or reliable?


No. The Information is a snapshot that provides only positive information about the Pro�led Issuers.
The Information consists of only positive content. We do not and will not publish any negative
informationabout the Pro�led Issuers; accordingly, investors should consider the Information to be
one-sided and NOT balanced, complete, accurate, truthful or reliable.


What will happen if an investor relies on the Information?


If an investor relies on the Information in making an investment decision it is highly probable
that the investor will lose most, if not all, of his or her investment. Investors should not rely on the
Information to make an investment decision.


So just how extensive has the promotion campaign been ? There is one location
(http://newsletter.hotstocked.com/newsletters/view/LIVE_NASDAQ_Long_Term_to_Watch-1943812) out there
which has archived just a few of the promotion emails out there. That site does not even have the most recent
mailers (which I already showed above) and it does not track to the websites such as “Stock Market Leader”
(which I also showed above).


We can see that a large variety of seemingly “independent” stock promotion �rms have now been
paid millions of dollars to run this type of campaign on Live Ventures. As shown above, the
information is only positive and consists of pure hype to drive the share price up.


In the past, one promoter, was actually paid a whopping $1 million to run a short term promotion
campaign on LIVE.

Prior to the recent 1:6 reverse split, a �rm by the name of Market Byte

us the following:


(https://staticseekingalpha.a.ssl.fastly.net/uploads/2017/1/5/4238561-1483675849289683_origin.png)


So that implies a target price of $30-42 now that we are past the reverse split. Market Byte was paid
$15,000 (http://newsletter.hotstocked.com/newsletters/view/OTCJ_:_Bank_Of_America_Loves_LIVE-
2139912) for this.

will be back to talk about “LIVE” at another date in time…. Hopefully it will be one this Play has already
produced some INSANE Gains from it’s current low!


Again, there are well over 100 examples of such promotions on Live, with paid amounts varying from
a few thousand dollars to as high as $1 million.


And again, these are just the ones we can track down. Many more have likely been removed from
circulation and can no longer be found.

FRAUD)


Here are the 9 articles that Markowski has written over just the course of 6 weeks.


Before getting into the speci�cs on Michael Markowski, readers should take a step back and get some
perspective on these recent articles. As I will show, these articles deserve a high level of scrutiny
REGARDLESS of who wrote them.

(http://seekingalpha.com/article/4033668-2016-review-2017-
predictions-top-pick)


First, the timing is noteworthy. The author’s articles on LIVE never appeared until a massive simultaneous
paid promotion was being launched on Live Ventures, including payments of hundreds of thousands of dollars
to paid stock promoters. As in past promotions, this surge in promotional activity coincided with a reverse split
along with multiple apparent corporate developments. Yet these developments alone had no impact on the
stock, instead it was the promotions that boosted the stock. And these articles only appeared at the exact
same time as the promotions.


Second, the sheer number of articles deserves attention. In the space of just 6 weeks, the author released an
urgent �urry of 9 articles.


Third, the urgency and hyperbole behind the articles is unusual. The author urges readers to “buy at market”
and not use limit prices, even as the stock was hitting new 52 week highs. To recommend retail investors
place “market” orders on a low �oat small cap stock is downright irresponsible. Even relatively small orders
could create large price surges, resulting in terrible execution prices for investors. Even as the price continued

7/5/2019 Short LIVE. Massive Paid Promotions, Heavy Accounting Manipulation, Deficient Auditor And More - MOX Reports

to rise, the author continues to urge “market” orders at higher and higher prices and then continues to raise
his price target. Investors are explicitly told (in ALL CAPS) to NOT SELL shares, even as they hit a new high.
(The next day the shares fell by almost 30%.)


Fourth, the blatant errors, inaccuracies and omissions deserve special attention. A few of these are included
below.


Again, the point I am trying to make is that when we see this combination of problems, we should immediately
start to be highly concerned about the author and his content.


But this content didn’t come from just any author. It came from Michael Markowski. That makes the problem
visibly much bigger.


Markowski frequently touts his “prestigious” background in the stock market with quotes such as:


Named by Fortune as one of its “50 Great Investors”.
Acknowledged as Cash Flow From Operations (CFFO) expert by WSJ, Fortune,
Forbes.com and Smartmoney.com
Entered capital markets upon graduation from college in 1977. Broker, IPO banker,
analyst and futures trader during career


What Mr. Markowski fails to include in this “prestigious” biography is that he was expelled from the securities
industry for committing extensive securities fraud and then barred by the SEC
(https://www.sec.gov/litigation/opinions/34-44086.htm) from future activities.


This was not a “minor” securities fraud case.


Instead, the SEC explicitly described the conduct of Markowski as “egregious” and noted that


Markowski has provided no credible assurance against future violations. Indeed, Markowski’s
testimony bespeaks a complete lack of understanding of, and appreciation for, the regulatory scheme
governing the securities industry.


According to the SEC:


Markowski’s conduct with respect to market manipulation and customer complaints regarding
unexecuted sell orders demonstrates a high degree of scienter.


Scienter is a legal term that refers to intent or knowledge of wrongdoing. This means that an o�ending party
has knowledge of the “wrongness” of an act or event prior to committing it.


According to the SEC (https://www.sec.gov/litigation/opinions/34-44086.htm), below is what Markowski did.
Readers can note for themselves the eerie similarities to his current articles on Live Ventures.


Markowski “conducted aggressive and fraudulent sales campaigns to promote the
securities, which included making speci�c price predictions about the securities”
Markowski then “instructed Global brokers to solicit unlawfully aftermarket orders
during the distribution of the units.”
Markowski then “restricted the supply of these securities by discouraging brokers
from accepting customer sell orders, reprimanding brokers who did accept sell
orders, paying brokers commissions on buy orders but not sell orders, and
fraudulently delaying the execution of customer sell orders for days, weeks, or
even months.

7/5/2019 Short LIVE. Massive Paid Promotions, Heavy Accounting Manipulation, Deficient Auditor And More - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 15/28


The SEC notes that these problems were brought to the attention of Markowski by the �rm’s compliance
o�icer, but he still did nothing. Markowski came up with numerous excuses for the behavior, including blaming
the problems on a �re which damaged the �rm’s telephone systems. (Unfortunately, the SEC shows that the
problems began well before that �re even occurred.)


The violations above occurred with at least 3 di�erent stocks. But these violations themselves were not
isolated.


The SEC then noted that:


Markowski also has a disciplinary history. He failed to provide the NASD with access to Global’s
books and records in the initial stages of the NASD’s investigation of the same market manipulation at
issue here. This is a serious violation of the NASD’s Rules of Fair Practice for which Markowski was
censured, �ned $50,000, and given a two-year suspension in all capacities and a permanent
bar from acting as a principal or having any �nancial interest in any NASD member �rm.


As I see it, Mr. Markowski has acted in a similar fashion with Live Ventures. He seeks to drive up the price in
the same way, by inciting “market orders” in a small cap, low �oat stock. He continues to urge additional
buying even as the share price soars, continually raising his target price, using speci�c prices as he did in the
fraudulent conduct above. He then seeks to dissuade investors from selling even as the share price begins to
fall apart.


The SEC also noted that following his involvement the 3 stocks above, the share prices all collapsed.


Here is a brief list of just a few of the inaccurate statements made by Mr. Markowski in his articles:


1. For Live, he stated (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-markowski/4945757-short-
activity-) that “Before conducting any additional analysis, I checked out its auditor. I discovered that it
was Anton Chia, which is one of the most respected and SEC approved auditing �rms.” As shown in
the next section. Anton & Chia was cited in September 2016 for multiple egregious audit de�ciencies, its
clients list largely consists of imploded reverse mergers for China/Asia OTC stocks, many of which either
trade for just pennies or no longer report or trade.


2. He also stated (http://seekingalpha.com/article/4033441-live-ventures-diagnosed-second-rare-cash-�ow-
anomaly) that LIVE had positive Free Cash Flow of positive $2.0 million in Q4 2016. This is provably wrong. In
fact, Live Ventures had a Free Cash Flow of NEGATIVE $2.5 million. As a self described “cash �ow expert”,
Mr. Markowski should certainly be familiar with the standard de�nition
(http://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/freecash�ow.asp) of FCF: “Free cash �ow (NYSE:FCF
(http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/FCF)) is a measure of a company’s �nancial performance, calculated as
operating cash �ow minus capital expenditures.” It is actually very simple and well de�ned. Yet for some
reason, Mr. Markowski decided to add $3.3 million back for prepaid expenses. This is simply an arbitrary
adjustment made by Mr. Markowski to arrive at a positive number.


3. On December 20th (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-markowski/4943182-live-venture-),
Markowski stated that Live Ventures has an extremely rare “Free Cash 50% yield”. As of that date, Live
Ventures was already trading at $20, which would mean that Live Ventures was generating Free Cash Flow of
$10 per share, or $28 million. Even using the exaggerated numbers provided above does not come anywhere
near $28 million in FCF in 2016. And then it gets even better. Markowski states that: “Due to LIVE having an
extremely rare Free Cash 50% Yield anomaly its share price will go to a minimum of $50.00 in 2017
regardless of how the S&P 500 performs.”

https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 16/28


4. Stock “bulls” commonly try to blame short sellers when a stock price implodes. They try to use this to
convince retail buyers to buy the stock. Markowski stated that (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-
michael-markowski/4945300-live-shares-) “Based on 2.2 million shares trading on December 28th, the
probability is high that short sales accounted for a signi�cant percentage of the volume.” In fact, we can see
the amount of short interest over time at NASDAQ.COM (http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/live/short-interest).
Over the past 4 months, total short interest has ranged from 70,000-90,000, so nothing near the millions of
shares that Markowski implies. From the site iBorrowDesk, we can see that total additional shares available to
be shorted has seldom been more than 25,000 on any given day. And before he tries to blame the “naked
shorting” bogeyman (another favorite excuse and distraction for stock “bulls”), we can see that the SEC also
tracks the total amount of shares being shorted “naked”. It is called their “fail to deliver list”.
(https://www.sec.gov/foia/docs/failsdata.htm)For Live Ventures, the most recent number of “failed to deliver”
(i.e. naked shorted) shares amounted to just 4,054 shares (yes, just four thousand shares). The reality is that
short sales have accounted for virtually none of the volume. Anyone who claims 40 years in the industry
should be able to �nd this information in just a few minutes.


5. Markowski states (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-markowski/4945300-live-
shares-) that “CEO Jon Isaac owns 1.1 million shares”. As shown below, Isaac controls over 1.5 million
shares, nearly half of which are available for immediate sale via warrant exercise. That is a di�erence of
nearly $10 million into the CEO’s pocket and is directly relevant when we are looking at stock promotions.


Beyond the inaccuracies we can see multiple statements which are deeply reckless in his explicit buy
“recommendations”.


1. Mr. Markowski urges investors to place “at market (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-
markowski/4943182-live-venture-)” purchase orders


2. He also urges investors to place “Good Til Cancled Limit Orders”
(http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-markowski/4945300-live-shares-) to buy at a price of
$26.25 (even as the share price was plunging to $22). The e�ect of this would obviously be to support the
share price.


3. He makes statements such as: “Due to LIVE having an extremely rare Free Cash 50% Yield anomaly its
share price will go to a minimum of $50.00 in 2017 regardless of how the S&P 500 performs.”


4. Assuming that LIVE’s outstanding shares remain at 2.8 million the minimum price for its shares by the end
of 2017 could potentially range from $45 to $180.00.


5. “LIVE’s shares are being shorted instead of being aggressively purchased. Its because should an investor
or conduct a preliminary analysis and not dig much deeper the tendancy is to short instead of buying LIVE
shares. Upon investors becoming aware of this anomaly the share price will go to above $100. This report will
enable you to fully grasp the signi�cance of the anomaly and why a short squeeze is inevitable.” As shown
above, anyone with even a few years of experience in the market would know that this information is provably
false with just a few minutes of looking.


For reference, here is the most recent short interest data from NASDAQ.COM. It shows that short interest in
Live Ventures has consistently been negligible. Mr. Markowski would know that with just a single Google
search of “LIVE Short Interest”.

PART C – DEBUNKING THE PROMOTION FODDER


In every promotion campaign, it is necessary to have some talking points for the promoters to sell to retail
investors. This is what I refer to as the “promotion fodder”.


As will be shown in greater detail further below, each of these items has been overly hyped or misrepresented
outright in promoting the stock.


In fact, even the press releases put out by Live Ventures itself contain information that does not match
its SEC �lings. Not surprisingly, the erroneous information is heavily to the advantage of the share
price.


Fodder #1: The “lockup”


In December, Live Ventures announced (https://globenewswire.com/news-
release/2016/12/28/901923/0/en/Live-Ventures-Announces-Biggest-Year-in-Company-History-Achieving-
Record-Earnings-of-8-92-Per-Share-With-Continued-Growth-Anticipated-in-2017.html) that:


In December, Isaac Capital Group, our largest stockholder, agreed to lock up ALL of their shares for
�ve years (through December 31, 2021)… Accordingly, our common stock was reduced from
approximately 2.8 million to 2.0 million shares.


Isaac Capital Group is controlled by Live Venture’s CEO Jon Isaac. He is the largest shareholder.


The message here is clear. The CEO cannot sell any of his shares until 2021. Clearly this is a strong vote of
con�dence in the stock, and it has helped support the share price.


But that assumption is wrong. The following information can be found in the footnotes
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1jbnf.w1Z5.htm#1stPage) (part F-19) of the 10K.


If we look at warrants / options held by Jon Isaac and/or his Isaac Capital Group, we can see that he has
control of more than 1.5 million underlying shares in total. This includes almost 590,000 shares underlying his
warrants. These warrants have an average exercise price of just $4.14 and they actual EXPIRE in less than 2
years. THE WARRANTS ARE EXCERCISEABLE IMMEDIATELY.

7/5/2019 Short LIVE. Massive Paid Promotions, Heavy Accounting Manipulation, Deficient Auditor And More - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 18/28


So here is the kicker, by appearing to lock up “ALL” of his common stock, the CEO supports the share price.
He therefore can get a much higher price when he sells nearly 700,000 other shares that no one seems to
have noticed. Even if the original shares go to zero in 5 years, the CEO would stand to make more than $10
million if sold at current prices. Without giving the “appearance” of a lockup, this would not otherwise be
possible for the CEO.


And again, the warrants can be exercised for just $4.14, they are exercisable immediately and they EXPIRE in
less than 2 years. The “lockup” is nonsense.


But it gets even better. In order to e�ect this apparent “lockup”, the CEO “converted” his 800,000 shares of
common stock into basically identical preferred shares. As a result, when Live Ventures announced their EPS
for 2016, they divided their “earnings” by 2 million shares rather than 2.8 million shares. This is how the
company seemingly reported an EPS of $8.92.


Live Ventures Announces Biggest Year in Company History Achieving Record Earnings of $8.92 Per Share
With Continued Growth Anticipated in 201 (http://ir.live-ventures.com/press-releases/detail/1535/live-ventures-
announces-biggest-year-in-company-history)7


But that $8.92 was ONLY announced in the �ashy press release. It was not included in the SEC �led 10K
(http://www.secinfo.com/d1jbnf.w1Z5.htm#1stPage). (Feel free to run a text search through the 10K for
yourself). In the actual SEC �lings, we can see that Live Ventures was forced to report the actual EPS number
of $5.40.


And as we see next, even that $5.40 was EPS was only the result of one-time GAAP earnings manipulation.
Without that manipulation, the company actually would have reported a NET LOSS, NOT ANY NET INCOME
AT ALL.


(We will look more closely at problems with Live Venture’s PCAOB de�cient auditor below.)


Fodder #2: The supposed surge in “earnings”


The tremendous promotion surrounding Live Ventures appears to have really kicked o� right around the time
when Q4 earnings were announced (http://ir.live-ventures.com/press-releases/detail/1531/live-ventures-
reports-better-than-expected-net-pro�t-of-30) on November 21st, 2016.


At that time, the company telegraphed that it expected “record” year-end �nancials would be announced in
December. Many promoters as well as “bulls”, including Markowski, began amplifying these expectations and
urging investors to aggressively purchase the shares.


Live Ventures certainly did not disappoint (well, at least not on the surface). On December 29th, the
company announced (http://ir.live-ventures.com/press-releases/detail/1536/live-ventures-hits-79-million-in-
revenues-while-company) (in a press release only) that it had reported “record” earnings of $8.92 per share.


Hype around the upcoming earnings caused the share price to brie�y spike by as much as 40%, from $23 to
$32. But once the 10K was released and read, the stock quickly gave up all of these gains.


As already shown above, the $8.92 number is clearly wrong. It was only achieved by using a too-small share
count which was not included in the actual SEC �lings. The SEC �led 10K shows EPS of $5.40.


But even that $5.40 number is not an accurate representation.


Live Ventures reported total Net Income of $17.8 million for 2016. This number is WRONG.


In the press release, the company then dividend this $17.8 million by 2 million shares outstanding to report
EPS of $8.92 in the press release. As shown above, this number is also WRONG.

7/5/2019 Short LIVE. Massive Paid Promotions, Heavy Accounting Manipulation, Deficient Auditor And More - MOX Reports


https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 19/28


In calculating the $17.8 million in Net Income, Live Ventures added in multiple one time arbitrary items which it
added at its own discretion. These were not the result of any ongoing business.


This included the following:


Item Amount


Bargain purchase gain on acquisition $4.6 million


Change in deferred tax expense $12.5 million


Vendor and note settlements $1.7 million


Gain on asset sales $179,000


TOTAL $18.98 million


As you can see from the names of the line items above, each of these items are non-operating items which
have nothing to do with the ongoing business of Live Ventures. Together, these items count for more than
100% of the supposed “pro�t” reported by the company.


The bulk of these items were added at the discretion of management in a way that is simply arbitrary. They
simply added them because they wanted to.


The reality is that without the bene�t of these arbitrary accounting manipulations, Live Ventures didn’t show
any pro�t at all. Instead, Live Ventures actually LOST around $1.5 million instead of EARNING over $17
million.


So the question becomes: how does Live Ventures auditor allow the company to get away with such
egregious behavior ?


After earnings were released (and as the stock was quickly falling), stock promoter Markowski assured
investors that arbitrary items such as “Bargain purchase gain on acquisition” were actually a strong positive
for the company. He states (http://seekingalpha.com/research/3255271-michael-markowski/4945757-short-
activity-) that:


It’s pure and simple, LIVE’s earnings increased by $4.5 million due to the company being extremely
conservative in valuing and negotiating an acquisition. It is what it is!


Markowski noted that:


I had never in my 40 years seen the booking of such an entry on a company’s Financial
Statements….Before conducting any additional analysis, I checked out its auditor. I discovered that it
was Anton Chia, which is one of the most respected and SEC approved auditing �rms.


I agree with Markowski in that “bargain purchase gain on acquisition” is a very rare item. I have been deeply
involved in the stock market since the late 1990’s and I have never seen it either. It is basically a made up
item used to arbitrarily boost the company’s earnings.


As for the audit �rm of Anton Chia, Markowski’s statements are �at out WRONG. That �rm is neither the “most
respected” nor “SEC approved”.

Anton Chia is not a big 4 auditor. It is not a top 10 auditor. In fact, it is so obscure that I can’t �nd any mention
of it in the top 50 auditors. But we’ll let that slide for now.


First o�, the SEC does not “approve” auditors. So that statement is �at out WRONG.


Second, in September 2016 (yes, very recently), the PCAOB disclosed egregious de�ciencies
(https://pcaobus.org/Inspections/Reports/Documents/104-2016-176-Anton-Chia.pdf) in the audit practice of
Anton & Chia. Their report is publicly available and easy to �nd.


To read all of the de�ciencies noted, simply read the report. In the very beginning of its report on Anton &
Chia, the PCAOB noted that:


Certain de�ciencies identi�ed were of such signi�cance that it appeared to the inspection team that the
Firm, at the time it issued its audit report, had not obtained su�icient appropriate audit evidence to
support its opinion that the �nancial statements were presented fairly…In other words, in these audits,
the auditor issued an opinion without satisfying its fundamental obligation to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the �nancial statements were free of material misstatement.


All told, the PCAOB cited 11 such material de�ciencies, several of which appear to be strikingly similar to the
accounting shenanigans that we see at Live Ventures.


Examples from the PCAOB de�ciency report (published September 2016) include the following:


Does this sound familiar ?


the Firm’s failure to identify, or to address appropriately, a departure from GAAP that appeared to the
inspection team to be material, which related to the improper valuation of a recorded impairment loss


Does this sound familiar ?


the failure to perform su�icient procedures to test a business combination


Does this sound familiar ?


the failure to perform su�icient procedures to test the occurrence and valuation of revenue, including
the inadequate performance of substantive analytical procedures


Many audit de�ciencies involve a lack of due professional care.


Anton Chia does not disclose its client list on its website. The only lists I can �nd are on the site “Auditor
Carousel (https://auditorcarousel.wordpress.com/category/auditor-change-2/page/2/)” which highlights auditor
changes typically due to the implosion of the auditor or due to auditor shopping by microcap companies.


Here are the companies named as RECENT (2016) past or current clients of Anton Chia

So it is hard to see how Markowski comes up with Anton Chia as being among the “most respected” auditors.
In fact, I view having an auditor like Anton Chia as being more of an embarrassment than a mark of honor.


In any event, to me, the use of Anton Chia helps to explain how a $1.5 million dollar net loss was
magically transformed into an accounting pro�t of almost $18 million without any underlying business
activity to support it.


Fodder #3: The acquisition of Vintage (AKA the next Blockbuster and the next Borders Books)


On November 7th, Live Ventures announced (http://ir.live-ventures.com/press-releases/detail/1529/live-
ventures-incorporated-announces-closing-of-60m) the acquisition of Vintage Stock, a retailer which buys and
sells things like used movies (including VHS), music CD’s and video games. The cost of the acquisition was
$60 million and was done via bank �nancing (i.e. no stock was issued).


At the time of the acquisition, the stock barely budged. On the day before the acquisition, the stock sat at
$10.98. On the day the acquisition was announced, the stock hit $11.52, up a few percent. On the next day,
the stock was �at. No one cared.


The reason for the lack of enthusiasm is that trading music CDs and old video games in retail stores is not a
growth business anymore. Much of this is now simply done online. Videos, music and games can simply be
downloaded without visiting a store. If I want to buy a physical copy, I do so via Amazon for a fraction of the
price.


Vintage continues to engage in activities (http://www.vintagestock.com/about-vintage-stock) such as movie
and video game rentals, just like the now bankrupt Blockbuster. In fact, Vintage actually acquired
(http://www.vintagestock.com/about-vintage-stock) many of its Dallas area stores directly from Blockbuster
and brags that it now o�ers “over a million titles to choose from in Movies, Music and Video Games.”


Following the going-out-of-business of its local competitor Hastings, Vintage simply moved in to that
location in Kerryville, TX. Vintage hopes it will do better than its bankrupt predecessor


Vintage also bought a few locations of Borders Books (http://www.hccommunityjournal.com/article_413f7334-
9541-11e6-a6da-c325f6a84fd0.html) as that company too was going bankrupt. Vintage has stated that it
follows an 80-20 rule, where the 20% consists of selling books and magazines, just like the bankrupt Borders
used to do.


Vintage also engages (http://www.vintagestock.com/frequently-asked-questions#return-policy) in the odd
niche business of repairing scratched music CDs, for those out there who still use music CDs.

https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 22/28


Vintage even continues (http://www.vintagestock.com/frequently-asked-questions#return-policy) to carry game
cartridges for vintage consoles such as Atari and the old Nintendo, which were popular in the 1980’s.


There was no detailed 8K released with legacy or pro forma �nancials, such that we don’t really know what
Live Ventures purchased here. But we do know that Vintage has 40 locations spanning 5 states, with 900
employees, such that getting $60 million in bank �nancing should not have been di�icult for the company.
Vintage could have certainly borrowed that much money itself.


For example, if Vintage owns $60 million of real estate, the Live Ventures could have just paid $60 million in
exchange for $60 million in real estate, with the business itself being largely worthless.


But as we have seen, stock promoters needed some fodder for their promotions. And even though Live
Ventures was clearly stepping into the shoes of several bankrupt predecessors, the promoters were able to
spin it for a few weeks.


The website for Vintage describes its inventory of videos, music and games as being “massive”. So a second
theory is that the “value” here was simply that of over valued obsolete inventory. After all, what are rental
DVD’s worth today now that everyone can simply stream from Net�ix, Hulu or Amazon for just a few dollars
without ever leaving their home. If Live Ventures is valuing these rental videos “at cost” of $20 or more, then a
$60 million valuation could be easily justi�ed. But obviously older titles of used rental videos now have a value
which is almost nil.


Because there has been no detailed 8K �led, we simply have no idea.


But just as with the other items of fodder, the promoters have been quick to predict multi bagger share price
increases based on the minuscule amount of vague and unsubstantiated information released by Live
Ventures.


(Note: Here is an example (https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/07/06/853949/0/en/DLH-Provides-
Pro-Forma-Financial-Information-on-Danya-Acquisition.html) of a typical 8K that virtually all companies put out
upon completion of an acquisition. It contains all of the relevant historical and pro forma �nancial information
along with the detailed terms of the transaction and �nancing.)


It is notable that at the time Live Ventures announced the deal in November, that annual sales were
immediately expected to increase to $160 million. But just a few weeks later, this number was already quickly
being reduced (http://ir.live-ventures.com/press-releases/detail/1536/live-ventures-hits-79-million-in-revenues-
while-company) to $120 million. They had therefore been overstated by 33%. No explanation for the steep
revision was given.


The point is this. Live Ventures completed this acquisition in November and immediately put out a press
release touting several unsubstantiated forecasts. Live Ventures never put out an SEC �led 8K with any
concrete details. As we have seen in the past, there have been substantial discrepancies between Live
Ventures press releases and its SEC �lings. We literally have no idea what Live Ventures has purchased here
because nothing has been disclosed. The company is already backing away from its initial vague rosy
statements.


But so far the promoters behind Live Ventures have been quick to seize on the acquisition as further proof that
the stock is going to catapult upwards by several hundred percent in 2017.


Even a casual analysis of Vintage reveals that the company is in various dying businesses including DVD and
VHS rentals, CD music exchange and CD/DVD scratch repair. Vintage has repeatedly been buying out the
locations of other dying businesses such as Blockbuster, Borders and Hastings, all of which went bankrupt /
out of business.

All of the commentary above has been supported with links to external sources, including the company’s own
SEC �lings.


I have demonstrated clearly that CEO Jon Isaac has an extra 700,000 shares which are available through
warrants / options, most of which are exercisable immediately. This information can be found clearly in the
10K.

In the commentary above I also showed very clearly “what was the impact of the EPS add backs and how
they were calculated”. The answer is the earnings went from $17 million to a loss of around $1.5 million. I
broke down what each component was.


I also showed that the number $8.92 for EPS was included in a press release, but this is signi�cantly di�erent
than what is in the 10K �led just 1 day later.


I did send an email to Live Ventures’ IR email address. Rather than paraphrase anything, I have included here
a screenshot of the response. (Responses from Live Ventures are in blue.)


I suggest that readers read the response below and then re-read the commentary above, clicking on the links
to the various �lings.


I note that in the responses below, in 4 out of 5 items, the response clearly did not actually answer the
question that I asked.


For question number 4 (which was answered), the company has stated that they have 71 days to �le an 8K
for the acquisition. This should be interesting given that the CFO was just hired yesterday.

Conclusion


Live Ventures is a stock promotion which has been aggressively pumped by some of the most notorious stock
touts in the business. These promoters have been paid millions of dollars to present skewed information on
Live Ventures. Buried in their disclosures is the fact that they expect the stock to rise sharply on their
promotion and to then plunge when it ends. They warn that anyone who buys into the stock should expect to
lose “most or all of their investment”. These are the same stock promoters who have blatantly promoted
frauds such as Force�eld Energy, which was delisted and went to zero within just a few days of my report on
that company.


The most recent stock “bull” to get behind Live Ventures is Michael Markowski. Markowski began writing
about Live Ventures just as the paid promotion was picking up steam and he quickly put out 9 articles in just 6
weeks. He has aggressively urged readers to put in “at market” buy orders, driving up the stock. He analysisSCROLL

https://moxreports.com/live-live-ventures-exposed-massive-paid-promotions-heavy-accounting-manipulation-deficient-auditor-and-more/ 25/28


contains numerous statements which can be proven totally false with just a few minutes of checking.
Markowski was barred for life by the SEC following multiple instances of stock fraud which the SEC described
as “egregious”. The bar on Markowski was deemed by the SEC to be in the public interest.


The ample promotion fodder on Live Ventures is easily debunked.


The supposed “lockup” of shares held by the CEO ignores around 700,000 shares which can be sold via
exercising deep in the money warrants and options. These options are exercisable immediately and expire in
less than 2 years.


The tremendous surge in “earnings” from Live Ventures was simply the result of accounting manipulation,
including where Live Ventures “wrote up” the assets in acquired in the past. It made these various
adjustments at its sole discretion, and thus transformed a $1.5 million loss into a $17 million accounting
“pro�t”. As shown, Live Ventures uses a penny stock auditor known for auditing imploded China/Asia OTCBB
stocks. This same auditor was cited by the PCAOB in 2016 for numerous and egregious audit de�ciencies,
including ones which bear striking similarity to the adjustments seen at Live Ventures.


 The recent acquisition of Vintage Stock is effectively the equivalent of buying
Blockbuster Video and Borders Books, both of which went bankrupt due to the transition
to online viewing and downloading. Even a cursory view of Vintage’s website reveals
that it still deals heavily I things like VHS cassette tapes and cartridges for 20 year old
gaming consoles. The acquisition simply made for more talking point fodder for the
stock promoters.
The promotion on Live Ventures has clearly come to an end. That is why the stock has been falling each day
and why volume has been declining.


As the stock promoters clearly warned us:


What will happen when the Campaign ends?


Most, if not all, of the Pro�led Issuers are penny stocks that are illiquid (they do not have much trading
volume at all) and whose securities are subject to wide �uctuations in trading price and volume. During
the Campaign the trading volume and price of the securities of each Pro�le Issuer will likely increase
signi�cantly. When the Campaign ends, the volume and price of the Pro�led Issuer will likely
decrease dramatically. As a result, investors who purchase during the Campaign and hold
shares of the Pro�led Issuer when the Campaign ends will probably lose most, if not all, of
their investment.
