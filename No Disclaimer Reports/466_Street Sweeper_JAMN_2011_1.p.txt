Jammin Java: Hot Stock, Bitter Aftertaste?

It’s time to wake up and smell the coffee! That’s exactly what Jammin Java
(OTCPK:JAMN), a heavily promoted coffee company, and – for very different reasons –
we would like investors to do.


Since the beginning of the year, JAMN has miraculously risen from the ashes of the “Grey
Market” graveyard to become one of the liveliest – and richest – stocks in the entire
microcap arena. JAMN has seen its stock shoot straight toward heaven, soaring from 55
cents to peak above $6 a share on massive daily volume, with its market value now
topping $355 million despite the company’s limited resources and operating history. (As
covered in more detail below, two of the Internet tout sheets pushing JAMN the hardest
effectively vanished -- disabled by their Internet servers -- on the day the stock’s trading
volume exploded past 20 million shares.)


JAMN stands out for its powerful connections, the first loudly celebrated by the company
and the second – involving a notorious stock promoter – carefully hidden from view.


For starters, as the company well knows, JAMN comes complete with a very seductive
story. JAMN counts Rohan Marley – one of seven children fathered by iconic Jamaican
musician Bob Marley – as both current chairman and original co-founder of the company.
Thanks to Marley’s son, JAMN has found itself with an attention-grabbing asset.


Through a private firm known as Marley Coffee LLC, corporate filings show, Rohan Marley
has granted JAMN an “exclusive, transferrable, worldwide license” to use the “Marley
Coffee” name to market the expensive coffee it apparently began selling just a few months
ago. JAMN imports its coffee beans from Africa and Central and South America (rather
than Jamaica itself), the company said, and then roasts them here in North America
before ultimately marketing the finished product – retailing for up to $72 (for a variety
pack) before discounts -- with help from the beloved Marley name.


Since JAMN was still classified as a “shell” corporation when it filed its latest financial
statements in December, reporting no revenue or cash in the bank at all, investors have
been bidding up the stock based on mere faith – as opposed to actual evidence – that the
company can drum up huge demand for its high-priced coffee. If the multiples assigned to

industry powerhouse Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) serve as any guide, investors are
basically treating JAMN like a company that sells almost $150 million worth of coffee a
year already and boasts healthy profit margins (approaching 10%) on those sales to boot.


At this point, in fact, JAMN actually looks more valuable on paper than the past “winner”
that stock promoters like to tout when predicting just how successful the company could
ultimately become. Through frequent and potentially expensive advertisements on Yahoo
Finance (now gone), promoters have teased investors with sexy pitches about the “next
Diedrich Coffee” -- which turns out to be none other than JAMN itself. Diedrich wound up
bankrupt before recovering and selling itself to Green Mountain Coffee Roasters
(NASDAQ:GMCR) for $300 million, records show, fetching a price that’s some $56.7
million lower than the market value assigned to JAMN despite its long-established
presence in the coffee industry.


Even the powerful Marley name cannot fully explain the astounding market value enjoyed
by this fledgling coffee company. As indicated above, JAMN can be linked to another –
less illustrious – name as well.


Vancouver stock promoter Shane Whittle has been connected to the company for years.
He served as a director of JAMN from August 2007 to May 2010, corporate filings show,
while filling key executive posts -- including CEO, president, secretary and treasurer --
throughout much of that same time period. Whittle also doubles as CEO of a Canadian
version of Marley Coffee, filings indicate, and ranks as a controlling player at U.S.-based
Marley Coffee LLC – which provided JAMN with its most valuable asset (the Marley
name).


Whittle also ranks as a major shareholder of JAMN itself. He owned almost 10 million
shares of JAMN stock last fall, records indicate, before selling 2 million shares – at just 2
cents apiece – in October and giving another 4.89 million shares away. Whittle smartly
held on to 2.49 million of his JAMN shares, however, which are now worth almost $13
million following an incredible four-month run.


Whittle originally caught our attention a year ago because of his apparent connection to
Big Bear Mining (OTC:BGBR), a heavily promoted penny stock that flew above $1.50 but
has long since crashed below 10 cents a share. Despite convincing evidence to the
contrary, Whittle angrily denied any ties to BGBR in a May 2010 interview with us.


To longtime followers of overhyped penny stocks, JAMN looks like it has neared (or even
reached) its tipping point as well. On a tear for the past month, interrupted by only a
handful of down days along the way, JAMN finally started to take some meaningful hits
