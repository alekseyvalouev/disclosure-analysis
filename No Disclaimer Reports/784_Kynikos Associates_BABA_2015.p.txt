Short-selling specialist Jim Chanos pitched Alibaba as a short at a
conference Friday, according to sources. 


Chanos — founder and president of Kynikos Associates — made his
pitch at the Morgan Stanley Lyford conference, citing "accounting
concerns," the sources said.


Alibaba's stock hit session lows on the news and was trading about 4
percent lower in midday trading.

Chanos also pitched JD.com — China's second-largest e-commerce
company — as a long in order to hedge the Alibaba short.


This led JD.com shares to session highs before trading over 2.5 percent
higher.

Chanos has been a longtime bear on China and warned in September
that Beijing was running out of room to borrow, which would lead to a
"credit event."


"The debt is still growing two to three 'X' the economy every year," he
said.


Alibaba did not immediately respond to a CNBC request for comment.


— CNBC's Scott Wapner and Matthew Belvedere contributed to this
report.
