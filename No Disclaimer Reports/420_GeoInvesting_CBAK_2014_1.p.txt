China BAK Battery (CBAK) –
Loan Default And
Foreclosure Bring China
BAK Battery’s Solvency And
Viability Into Question
July 22, 2014 By GeoTeam


CBAK lost a primary operating asset to foreclosure,
which should result in the company reporting little to
no revenue when it files its Q4 2014 September
results.
Loss of asset speaks volumes. CBAK hoped to sell
assets to fund future growth and repair its balance
sheet sporting Q2 negative equity of $56.5M, up 16%
vs. Q1.
We don’t think many investors buying CBAK are aware
of recent developments since the company has not
issued any formal related press releases on major
news wires.
We question CBAK’s viability to continue as an
operating entity unless it raises substantial capital,
which the company admits has been challenging.
CBAK is now essentially a start-up, which we believe
should be valued on shareholder equity. Our best case
scenario puts CBAK’s new book value per share at
around $0.10.


China BAK Battery (CBAK), together with its subsidiaries,
engages in the manufacture, commercialization, and
distribution of standard and customized lithium ion (Li-ion)
rechargeable batteries. However, as of Q2 2014, all of
China BAK’s producing assets have been repossessed by

creditors. The company has one remaining facility which is
still under construction. CBAK’s shares have been on a tear
since the end of June reaching a 52-week high of $5.00 on
July 2, 2014. According to an article at ZDNet, the run-up
was influenced by LG Chem’s intention to invest hundreds
of millions of dollars in China to build an electric vehicle
battery factory.


Misplaced Investor Optimism


Investors may not know that when CBAK reports its
financial results for Q4 ending September 30, 2014 it will
likely report little to no revenue and have minimal to
possibly negative shareholder equity. Why? CBAK just lost
its primary operating asset, BAK International, to a
Mr. Jinghui Wang due to July 2014 foreclosure
proceedings when it defaulted on an $86 million loan
obligation it executed with Wang just around six
months ago via two transactions. Mr. Wang then
collected on his debt by selling his BAK international
interest to a “third party.”


Investors are now left with a company that is in the
process of building a new battery facility in Dalian that
probably won’t even begin to generate revenue for several
months. And there is no guarantee that management will
be successful in growing its new business, given that it
seems to have failed in its prior attempt to successfully
grow a similar business with past due debts to suppliers
and creditors. In fact, the new factory, intended to target
sexier and higher margin battery segments (like EVs) than
CBAK’s legacy business, has not even met the minimum
required $6 million registered capital to legally begin
operations.


At best, assuming that the transfer of BAK International
included all of its assets and liabilities, we estimate that
CBAK’s shareholder value per share is a paltry $0.09

per share. This generous analysis assumes that the “third
party” acquired a business with negative net equity of $55
million.


Finally, investors that are excited about subsidies CBAK
received to fund certain initiatives should know they were
not provided carte blanche, as these subsidies have to be
repaid.


Basically, CBAK is now a development stage, near $50
million market cap, company with little if any revenue and
minimal book value. Unfortunately, investors buying CBAK
shares who don’t scrutinize SEC filings may not be aware
of these developments since the company has not issued
any formal press releases via major news wires.


Foreclosure Development Is No Joke; Dilution On The
Table


The foreclosure of CBAK’s primary asset should not be
taken lightly. Prior to the foreclosure management had
hoped to sell this asset to reduce debt and raise cash to
fund its new growth initiative. So it appears that the
potential sale of the asset would have been integral to
CBAK’s sustainability. Here are passages from CBAK s Q2
2014 report that was filed around 40 days before the
foreclosure of Shenzhen occurred:


“We intend to sell part of our low efficiency
assets and appreciating land and properties to
repay our short term debts and to provide cash
for the development of more promising products
such as high power batteries and Electric Vehicle
batteries”


As we have been suffering severe cash flow deficiencies,
we intend to sell part of our low efficiency assets and

appreciating land and properties to repay our short term
debts and to provide cash for the development of more
promising products such as high power batteries and
Electric Vehicle batteries. We transferred our 100% equity
interest in Tianjin Meicai to an unrelated party on August
27, 2013. We also intend to dispose of our 100%
equity interest in BAK International and its
subsidiaries (including all their assets and liabilities), and
the properties in Tianjin.


Now it appears CBAK will have to rely on other types of
financing “for the development of more promising products
such as high power batteries and Electric Vehicle batteries”
which, given the financial condition of the CBAK and the
lending environment in China, may not be in the bag. From
the Q2 2014 filing:


“In addition, as we are facing a more challenging
business environment and the Chinese
government has placed tightening lending
policies on state-owned banks in China, we
encountered more difficulties in obtaining funds
from local banks, and have a number of past
due liabilities to suppliers and third party
creditors.” [Emphasis added]


CBAK was already facing challenges raising capital when it
STILL HAD its primary operating asset. And now the
situation has gotten substantially worse.


CBAK Defaults On Loan Payment


LG Chem’s plans have largely overshadowed what was
unquestionably grave news disclosed in a CBAK 8-K filing
on July 3, 2014 announcing the loss of substantially all of
the Company’s BAK International Limited operating assets
to foreclosure. We will show that BAK International Limited

accounted for nearly 100% of CBAK’s 2013 and 2014
revenue. Although CBAK’s shares have since retraced some
of the July 2 surge they are still in our opinion substantially
overvalued at around $4.00.


On April 24, 2014, China BAK received a default notice
from Jinghui Wang, who loaned the company about $86
million dollars in two loan agreements dated December 17,
2013 and January 8, 2014. As part of the loan agreements,
the company pledged 100% of its equity interest in wholly-
owned Hong Kong subsidiary BAK International Limited. In
an April 30, 2014 8-K, the company warned that Mr.
Wang could foreclose on the ownership of BAK
International if a settlement could not be reached. CBAK
noted that BAK International constitutes a
substantial portion of the company’s assets.


After the market close on Friday July 3, 2014, the company
revealed in an 8-K filing that they could not reach a
settlement with Mr. Jinghui Wang, having defaulted on
loans he made to CBAK. The 8-K stated,


“On June 30, 2014, the Company received from
Mr. Wang notice that due to Shenzhen BAK’s
default under the Loans, he had foreclosed his
security interest in and sold and transferred to a
third party the Pledged BAK International Equity
for a purchase price of RMB520 million.” The
statement made in the 8-K follows:


“ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.


As previously disclosed, to repay its overdue
bank loans, Shenzhen BAK Battery Co., Ltd.
(“Shenzhen BAK”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of
China BAK Battery, Inc. (the “Company”)
borrowed from Mr. Jinghui Wang an aggregate of

RMB520 million (approximately $85.9 million)
(the “Loans”) in December 2013 and January
2014. To secure the repayment of the Loans, the
Company and the Company’s wholly-owned Hong
Kong subsidiary, BAK International Limited (“BAK
International”) separately entered into a
corporate guarantee with Mr. Wang, under which
each of the Company and BAK International
irrevocably and unconditionally guaranteed to the
lender timely performance by Shenzhen BAK of
its obligation to repay the Loans. In addition, the
Company pledged 100% of its equity interest in
BAK International to the lender as security for
Shenzhen BAK’s repayment of the Loans (the
“Pledged BAK International Equity”).


On June 30, 2014, the Company received from
Mr. Wang notice that due to Shenzhen BAK’s
default under the Loans, he had foreclosed his
security interest in and sold and transferred to a
third party the Pledged BAK International Equity
for a purchase price of RMB520 million.


As a result of the above foreclosure, the
Company currently owns a Hong Kong
subsidiary, China BAK Asia Holdings Limited,
which in turn wholly owns two Chinese
subsidiaries, Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd. and
Dalian BAK Power Battery Co., Ltd. (“Dalian BAK
Power”). Dalian BAK Power is engaged in the
business of developing, manufacturing and
selling new energy high power batteries, which
are used in electric cars, light electric vehicles
and other high power applications.”


We believe that it is currently a bit of stretch for CBAK to
state that…

“Dalian BAK Power is engaged in the business of

electric cars, light electric vehicles and other high
power applications.”


… since Dalian BAK Power was established in 2013 with a
yet to be fully constructed manufacturing facility that has
not raised the registered capital to operate.


CBAK Now a Development Stage Company


After the loss of BAK International, CBAK now owns only
two Chinese subsidiaries; Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd. and
Dalian BAK Power Battery Co., Ltd. As seen in the chart
below, the company lost a substantial portion of its assets
with the forfeiture of BAK International.


That leaves Dalian BAK Power and Dalian BAK Trading Co.,
Ltd. CBAK’s Q2 2014 filing carries the following
information:


“Dalian BAK Trading Co., Ltd. (BAK Dalian), a
wholly owned limited company established on
August 14, 2013 in the PRC; vii) Dalian BAK
Power Battery Co., Ltd. (Dalian BAK Power), a
wholly owned limited liability company
established on December 27, 2013 in the PRC;”


According to SEC filings, BAK Dalian was only just
established as a company on December 27, 2013 and has
not raised the $6 million needed to begin operations.

“Up to the date of this report (May 20, 2014), the
Company is in negotiation with the Business
Administration Bureau of Dalian District for
extension of payment of the initial capital of
$6,000,000.” Page F-5 Q2 2014 SEC filing


Combine these findings with the fact that the Dalian BAK
manufacturing facility is still not complete, and it appears
safe to assume that Dalian BAK Power did not have any
substantial business as of May 20, 2014. We believe this is
still the case and is supported by on-the-ground due
diligence indicating that Dalian BAK Power manufacturing
facility is not yet fully constructed and that construction
will not be completed by the end of CBAK’s Q4 2014 ending
September 30. Furthermore:


The facility will likely have to go through several
months of testing (assuming construction is ever
completed).
CBAK will likely have to convince banks or investors to
provide it with capital to complete construction and
manufacture product.
CBAK could have lost a good deal of its customers
that deal or have dealt with Shenzen BAK
International, its main source of revenue before BAK
international was lost to foreclosure.


Still, there is no guarantee that customers will wait around
for CBAK to potentially launch Dalian in a market with
capable competitors such as Highpower (HPJ). CBAK Q2
2014 filing states:


“The light electric vehicle market was becoming
more competitive. We intend to give up low value
customers while trying to retain high-end
customers.”

Investors deserve far more information from CBAK
management than what has been provided to date.


Valuation


Currently, since CBAK is essentially a zero revenue
producing asset, we believe that book value analysis is the
appropriate way to value CBAK, that is until it is assured
that the necessary capital can be raised to complete the
construction of the Dalian facility to be in a position to
generate revenue.


Investors may be assuming that CBAK is in good shape
now that it is not burdened with BAK International’s debt
load which resulted in CBAK sporting shareholder equity of
around negative $56 million. However, even after
considering the aggressive assumptions we used to value
CBAK, we calculate its post-BAK International equity per
share to be around $0.10. At around $4.00, CBAK is
currently trading well above this value.


To value CBAK post-BAK International we assumed that all
of its assets and liabilities were transferred to Mr. Wang,
ultimately ending up with the “third party.” We also erred
on the side of caution and retained assets we could not
identify as belonging to BAK International. Likewise, we
were aggressive by moving liabilities from the balance
sheet, which we could not easily identify.


Ultimately, we believe our calculation could be overly
aggressive since we assumed that the net assets
transferred out of CBAK to the “third party”
amounted to negative $55 million, for which the “third
party” paid Mr. Wang $83 million. So we believe that in the
end a good portion of that negative $55 million could have
remained with CBAK. Or perhaps there is more to this
transaction than meets the eye. Who is this third party? We
urge management to provide more details to investors on

what was actually transferred to the “third party.” We
know that Mr. Wang once was a shareholder in
CBAK. Why did he force foreclosure so quickly as opposed
to giving the company time to sell BAK International assets
(some land) that may have been able to cover debts and
provide working capital for CBAK? Recall that company
filings indicate that CBAK’s land (use rights) had
appreciated:


“We intend to sell part of our low efficiency
assets and appreciating land and properties to
repay our short term debts and to provide cash
for the development of more promising products
such as high power batteries and Electric Vehicle
batteries”


Our best-case reconciliation of CBAK’s balance sheet can be
seen below:

Additional assumptions with respect to above table:


According to SEC filings BAK Shenzen and BAK Tainjin
accounted for 80% and 20% of facility square
footage, respectively.
100% of building asset transferred as a result of
foreclosure
80% of machinery, office expense and motor vehicle
assets transferred as a result of foreclosure since
some of Tianjin assets had been in the process of
being moved to Dalian since 2013.

5/23/2018 China BAK Battery (CBAK) - Loan Default And Foreclosure Bring China BAK Battery's Solvency And Viability Into Question | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/loan-default-and-foreclosure-bring-china-bak-batterys-solvency-and-viability-into-question/ 11/14


The loans from Mr. Jinghui Wang in December 2013 and
January 2014, the creation of Dalian BAK at the end of
December 2013, and the subsequent foreclosure and sale
of the assets on June 30, 2014 raise a number of questions
and issues, enumerated below.


CBAK’s Operations And Financial Condition


Substantially all of CBAK’s business operations were
lost to the foreclosure on the BAK International
assets. What is the plan of operations for the company
and how will its financial condition be impacted during
the period it takes to get the Dalian BAK operations up
and running?


We have to assume that business operations have
been suspended until the Dalian BAK operations are
online. Does the company have adequate working
capital and financing to bridge the transitional period
while operations are moved from Shenzhen and
Tianjin to Dalian?


Assuming the new Dalian facility eventually goes
online, how long will it take to validate and ramp up
production of market-ready EV batteries? Does the
company have customers ready to take delivery of the
batteries?


Will CBAK be able to retain its BAK International
customers or will some be lost in the transition? The
battery business is highly competitive and customers
will have little problem finding new sources of supply
from companies that may be far more reliable and
solvent than CBAK.


Government Advances And Subsidies Need To Be
Repaid

5/23/2018 China BAK Battery (CBAK) - Loan Default And Foreclosure Bring China BAK Battery's Solvency And Viability Into Question | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/loan-default-and-foreclosure-bring-china-bak-batterys-solvency-and-viability-into-question/ 12/14


CBAK received a $24.1 million government advances
to relocate its operations from Tianjin to Dalian. The
advances will have to be paid back at some point.


An $8 million subsidy was received for the automated
high-power lithium battery project from the National
Development and Reform Commission and Ministry of
Industry and Information Technology. The company
will have to earn the subsidy or pay it back.


The company also has $15.3 million unearned
subsidies for various lithium battery related projects
from various government authorities. Are some or all
of those subsidies now payable to the respective
government authorities now that the Shenzhen
operations and assets have been lost?


Conclusion


We believe that investors who are getting excited about
CBAK’s near-term prospects probably have not properly
interpreted recent developments. The fact that its main
operating asset was lost to foreclosure means that CBAK
cannot generate meaningful revenues AND cannot raise
cash from the sale of this asset to fund its growth plan to
participate in a “sexy” segment of the battery market.
Concurrently, the foreclosure should raise CBAK’s need to
raise capital, while at the same time making this task all
the more challenging. These events make it difficult for
investors who want to ride the EV hype to get excited
about CBAK. Ultimately, we think CBAK shareholder equity
remains negative and that it is worse off than before the
foreclosure.
