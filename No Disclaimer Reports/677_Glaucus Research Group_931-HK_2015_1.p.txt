These are interesting times for the Hong Kong stock market.  On July 8, 2015, amid fears over plummeting 


PRC stocks and uncertainty over a Greek exit from the Euro, the Hang Seng Index recorded its largest single-


day fall since November 2008.  In such a volatile market environment, companies with unproven and 


speculative business models are most vulnerable to capital flight from skittish investors.  We believe that we 


have identified a stock poised for collapse which, despite recent price depreciation, remains wildly overvalued.  





China LNG Group Limited (“China LNG” or the “Company”), until recently known as a failed IT firm called 


Artel Solutions Group, is a Hong-Kong based business with minimal recurring revenue, limited assets and, 


inexplicably, an HKD 16.69 billion (US$ 2.15 billion) market capitalization.  





Other than its name (recently changed), China LNG has virtually no connection to the natural gas industry or 


to mainland China.  The Company’s LNG business has generated only HKD 131,750 in total revenues since 


inception.  Its operating business remains insignificant.  China LNG’s management team has no experience in 


the natural gas industry.  Rather, China LNG’s only meaningful source of revenue in its last fiscal year was 


from the appreciation of bonds, issued by a related party, which it purchased at below market price from its 


Chairman.   





Despite an unproven and deeply speculative business model, China LNG currently trades at 33.9x price/book 


value.  Yet China LNG is essentially a startup without any proprietary intellectual property, a meaningful 


operating business or tangible experience in the industry.  As such, we believe that it should be valued at or 


very close to book (like other energy companies), meaning we value the Company at HKD 0.08 per share, 


95% below China LNG’s last traded price.   
  


1. More Overvalued than Hanergy.  China LNG’s shares trade at 33.9x book value.  By comparison, 


Hong Kong listed energy companies trade at an average of 1.84x book value.  Global leaders in the 


energy space cluster around a similar ratio: 1.60x.  China LNG is so overvalued that its price to book 


ratio is 18.99 times greater than the average of Hong Kong listed and global energy companies and 


almost twice as high as Hanergy’s peak price to book ratio. 
 


a. Price To Sales Ratio Shows Gross Overvaluation.  Hong Kong and global energy companies 


currently trade for an average price to sales ratio of 1.32x.  Not China LNG.  Annualizing the 


partial year revenue figures from May-July 2015, as reported in the Company’s recent circular, 


we calculate that China LNG’s stock is currently trading at 19,917 times annualized sales of 


its LNG business.  At its peak closing price, Hanergy only traded at 27x annual sales.  Despite 


the fact that Hanergy was widely regarded as overvalued, measured on a price-to-sales ratio, its 


stock was a bargain compared to China LNG’s. 
 


2. Very Little LNG, Very Little China.  In May 2014, the Company changed its name to China LNG.  


Since then, despite its rebranding, the Company’s LNG business remains insignificant.   
 


a. Insignificant Revenues, Assets and Operating Business.  As of July 13, 2015, the Company’s 


LNG business has only generated HKD 131,750 in total revenues.  Ever.  At its current run rate, 


the Company’s LNG business will generate a paltry HKD 790,500 in revenues over the next 


year.  At last FYE, the Company did not own any meaningful assets related to the natural gas 


business.

b. No Intellectual Property or Proprietary Technology.  Nor does China LNG possess any technology, patents, trademarks, copyrights or 
operating rights which would give the Company any competitive advantage in entering a crowded industry. 





c. No Experience or Expertise.  None of China LNG’s senior managers appear to have any experience as an executive (or even a low level 
employee) working for an energy company.  Rather, China LNG’s senior management consists of four accountants and one former 


banker. 





d. Unproven and Flawed Business Plan.  To date, the sum total of China LNG’s operating business consists of vague announcements and 
non-binding framework agreements with various established businesses, two newly formed subsidiaries, and an unproven, speculative 


and deeply flawed business plan. 





i. Filling Stations.  China LNG intends to enter the downstream market by setting up LNG filling stations for heavy vehicles and boats 
sailing along inland rivers.  This field is already crowded with well-capitalized incumbents.  We estimate that there are, 


conservatively, over 2,300 LNG/CNG refilling stations in China, many owned and operated by some of the most experienced, well-


capitalized brand names in the Chinese energy space, including KunLun, CNOOC, PetroChina and Sinopec.  Other companies, such 


as China Tian Lun Gas Holdings Limited (“CTLG”) (HK: 1600), have leveraged an existing brand and network of traditional 


gasoline refilling stations to penetrate the LNG market.  Investors should be highly skeptical of China LNG’s ability to compete with 


established downstream energy service and delivery companies, who have the brand, balance sheet, operating experience and 


expertise to establish and successfully manage filling stations.   Furthermore, this business requires heavy capital expenditures.  


Industry estimates range from HKD 11 million to HKD 15 million per heavy vehicle refilling station, a significant expenditure 


considering that almost all of the Company’s cash balance has been allocated to lease financing. 





ii. Lease Financing for LNG Vehicles and Equipment.  China LNG has reportedly committed US$ 48 million (HKD 372 million), 
representing 70% of the Company’s total assets (at last FYE), into the Shanghai bank account of its newly formed subsidiary, 


China LNG Finance Leasing Co, to finance leases of LNG-equipped vehicles and vessels.  But this is already a crowded and 


competitive market.  We see no viable commercial reason to suspect that China LNG will be better at finding borrowers, evaluating 


credit, lending, and securing collateral than banks, truck manufacturers, dealerships and specialist-auto lenders who are already 


entrenched in the lease financing market.  China LNG is in by far the worst competitive position.  The Company is poorly financed 


(an understatement), and lacks the access to capital of bank-affiliated leasing companies.  It has no specialized knowledge of the 


industry or LNG vehicles, and cannot leverage a leasing business off of an already established brand, salesforce or infrastructure like 


manufacturers or dealerships.  Lease financing in the PRC is already a harsh competitive environment crowded with established and 


experienced competitors who are in a much better position to succeed than China LNG.     





iii. Sinopec: China LNG is NOT China Gas (HK: 384).  On November 25, 2014, China LNG announced a non-binding framework 
agreement with Sinopec, which created investor excitement that perhaps Sinopec would cooperate with and invest in China LNG like 


it did with China Gas (HK: 384) in 2004.  Shareholders should not hold their breadth: Sinopec invested in China Gas when its shares 


traded at 3.16x book value and after China Gas had developed a substantial and profitable natural gas business.  By comparison, 


China LNG’s shares are outrageously expensive (33.9x book) and it has no such operating business.   





Furthermore, the details of the proposed cooperation are non-binding and fuzzy.  As best we can tell, Sinopec expressed interest in 


designing, building and operating LNG refueling stations as well as supply LNG at a preferential price to the Company.  China LNG 


agreed to invest “not less than 100,000 LNG heavy trucks directly and not less than 200,000 heavy trucks indirectly” and guaranteed 


a minimum level of retail sales of LNG to Sinopec’s refueling stations.  This announcement raises more questions than answers.  


How will China LNG supply LNG equipped trucks?  The Company has a tiny balance sheet and as of last FYE, no established 


infrastructure or experience in the field.  Even the most optimistic projections put the number of LNG-equipped vehicles in China at 


800,000 by 2020 – does any investor realistically expect China LNG to finance 37% of this market?  China LNG does not have the 


balance sheet, operating experience or infrastructure to fulfill their end of the proposed cooperation, so we have serious doubts about 


Sinopec’s level of interest.  Ultimately, the agreement with Sinopec is no agreement at all.  It is simply a vague, flawed plan to talk 


again in the future. 





iv. History of Illusory Cooperation Agreements.  Since March 2014, China LNG has announced 20 non-binding letters of intent or 
cooperation agreements with various companies, commissions and development groups.  Although such cooperation agreements give 


investors the impression that China LNG is making significant progress in the LNG business, this impression is illusory.  To our 


knowledge, not a single one of the 20 non-binding agreements has led to a concrete, contractual business relationship or 


investment.  Nor are China LNG’s promises under such announcements realistic.  For example, from March 2014 through June 


2014, China LNG made five such announcements, promising to invest HKD 5 billion, obviously impossible given that the 


Company’s balance sheet recorded only HKD 549 million in total assets as of FYE 2014, (~11% of the promised investment amount).  


To our knowledge, such agreements have come to nothing.  In total, the Company’s non-binding agreements call on it to commit 


between HKD 14 billion and HKD 71 billion in investments into the LNG business, a farcical amount of capital considering the 


Company’s tiny balance sheet and limited operating history.

e. History of Failed New Businesses.  The Company’s pivot towards natural gas represents its fifth new business 
since 2007, when Chairman Billy Albert Kan became involved.  Management’s repeated failure to successfully 


launch new businesses casts further doubt on the viability of its entry into the crowded LNG space. 





3. Related Party Junk Bonds Return 375% in 6 months.  99% of China LNG’s 2014 revenue was derived from a one-off 
related party bond deal with its Chairman.  In January 2014, China LNG purchased from its Chairman HKD 80 million in 


convertible bonds issued by Warderly International (HK: 0607) (the “Warderly Bonds”), a Hong Kong listed company 


which was (at the time) also owned and controlled by China LNG’s Chairman.  The Chairman sold China LNG the 


Warderly Bonds at well below their market value.  In June 2014, China LNG agreed to sell the Warderly Bonds to Magnolia 


Wealth International Limited (“Magnolia”) for HKD 380 million, a 375% profit in just six months.  





a. Warderly’s Troubled Past.  Warderly is a Hong Kong-listed penny stock which went bankrupt in 2007 and 
whose shares were suspended from trading by the SFC from 2007 through until December 2013. China LNG 


Chairman Billy Albert Kan bought a controlling stake in Warderly in    2008, and despite repeated attempts to 


relist the stock, was refused by the HKEX and the SFC until he agreed to sell his interest in a reverse merger to a 


Chinese property developer at the end of 2013.  As part of the reverse merger, Warderly issued HKD 80 million in 


bonds (convertible at maturity) with an HKD 0.05 strike price to Billy Albert Kan.  One month later, he sold the 


bonds at the issue price to China LNG.   





b. No Explanation for Bond Appreciation.  In January 2014, the Company purchased Warderly bonds convertible 
at HKD 0.05 per share.  Given that Warderly’s shares were trading at well above the strike price, the value of the 


bonds should theoretically have been tied to the underlying price of Warderly’s stock.  However, Warderly’s share 


price declined 34.4% from HKD 0.38 to HKD 0.24 between the date China LNG purchased the Warderly Bonds 


and the date China LNG sold the bonds.   The only reason that China LNG made a 375% return on the Warderly 


Bonds was that its Chairman sold the bonds to the Company at well below the market price.  The most charitable 


explanation is that this was a sweetheart deal from the Company’s Chairman which is non-recurring revenue and 


cannot be factored into the Company’s valuation.  





4. Valuation.  China LNG currently trades at 33.9x price/book value.  Yet China LNG is essentially a startup without any 
proprietary intellectual property, a meaningful operating business or tangible experience in the industry.  As such, we 


believe that it should be valued at or very close to 1.79x book value (the average for HK and global energy comps).  We 


think the Company is worth HKD 0.08 per share, 95% below China LNG’s last traded price.

MORE OVERVALUED THAN HANERGY  





China LNG Group Limited (“China LNG” or the “Company”) was a longtime penny stock until a May-


2014 cosmetic re-brand into a natural gas company propelled the Company’s stock price up over 357%.  


Despite recent price depreciation, its stock remains wildly overvalued.  A comparison of price to book 


ratios, which is useful in the capital intensive energy business, underscores the absurdity of China LNG’s 


current stock price.   


As of the close of the market on July 13, 2015, the Company’s shares trade at 33.9 times the book value 


of its equity.  By comparison, Hong Kong listed energy comps trade at an average of 1.84x book value.  


Global leaders cluster around a similar ratio: 1.60x.

Hong Kong and global energy companies trade at an average of 1.79x book value.  By comparison, China 


LNG is wildly overvalued, trading at 18.99 times the average price to book ratio of this diverse basket 


of energy companies. 





Remarkably, China LNG’s stock price appears significantly more overvalued than the peak stock price 


of Hanergy, the poster child of wildly overvalued Hong Kong stocks.  Beginning in January 2013, 


Hanergy’s stock price rose 2006%, making its Chairman, Li Hejun, China’s richest man.  Hanergy’s 


market capitalization peaked at US$ 42 billion, despite numerous market commentators questioning the 


authenticity and value of its underlying business.   


The holy financial trinity of the Wall St. Journal, the Financial Times and Bloomberg, each released 


articles questioning the legitimacy of Hanergy’s business model, identifying the fundamental flaws in 


Hanergy’s financial statements and highlighting the weaknesses of its solar technology.  Yet Hanergy’s 


stock kept rising, peaking at a price to book ratio of 17x and a price to earnings ratio of over 79x.  For 


many market watchers, Hanergy’s stock price appeared completely disconnected to the value or 


performance of its underlying business.  And then it collapsed.  


On Wednesday, May 20, Hanergy’s shares plunged 47% in a matter of minutes, wiping out US$ 18 


billion in Hanergy’s market capitalization (and US$ 15 billion in its Chairman’s personal fortune).  The 


stock was suspended.  It remains halted, suggesting that if it ever trades again, much of its market 


capitalization may be wiped out. 


By comparison, China LNG’s stock price appears even more overvalued than Hanergy’s stock at its peak 


price.

China LNG’s price to book ratio is almost two times higher than Hanergy’s peak price to book ratio. 


Comparing price to sales ratios tells a similar story.  Hong Kong and global energy companies currently 


trade for an average price to sales ratio of 1.32x.  Not China LNG.  Annualizing the partial year revenue 


figures from May-July 2015, as reported in the Company’s recent circular, we calculate that China LNG’s 


stock is currently trading at 19,917 times the annualized forward sales of its LNG business.

Hong Kong and global energy companies tend to trade between 0.5-2.0x annual sales.  China LNG is so 


overvalued relative to its tiny operating business that it trades at a price of 19,917 times its annualized 


LNG revenues.   


At its peak closing price, Hanergy traded at 27 times annual sales.  Despite the fact that Hanergy was 


widely regarded as overvalued, measured on a price to sales ratio, its stock was a bargain compared to 


China LNG’s.  





China LNG is grossly overvalued by almost any metric.  We believe it is simply a matter of time before 


follows Hanergy over the ledge.

VERY LITTLE NATURAL GAS, VERY LITTLE CHINA 





China LNG’s market capitalization now exceeds HKD 16 billion, despite the fact that as of FYE 2014, it 


had only seventeen employees, it had not made a dollar from the natural gas business, and had no 


operations in China.   





China LNG’s spotty record of failed new ventures makes this recent stock price appreciation even more 


unlikely.  China LNG used to be known as Artel Solutions Group, a failed IT firm which almost went 


bankrupt when it was sued by its creditors, suppliers (including Intel) and employees for failure to pay its 


bills.  In September 2006, creditors filed a petition to wind up the Company, forcing the HKEX to 


suspend trading of China LNG’s shares while China LNG looked for new ownership.   





In 2007, Billy Albert Kan, a little known former accountant and penny stock promoter, forced out the 


previous Chairman and acquired a 76% controlling interest in the Company.  China LNG soon abandoned 


its failing IT solutions business and began trading stocks and bonds of companies listed in Hong Kong 


until it announced in May 2014, that it was entering the natural gas business.  This is the Company’s fifth 


business since Billy Albert Kan took over the Company. 





LNG is faddish, with perpetual pollution in China propelling investor excitement in cleaner alternatives.  


But investors looking to take advantage of Beijing’s push towards cleaner fuels should invest elsewhere, 


because China LNG has virtually no connection to either China or the LNG business.  Other than to sell 


stock to unsuspecting investors hungry for the next fad, there is no viable commercial reason for a 


Company with no assets, experience, or business to enter a crowded field such as LNG. 





1) Insignificant Revenues, Assets and Operating Business 
 


According to the Company’s recent circular, since its March 2014 rebranding, the Company has made 


HKD 131,750 in total revenues from its Chinese natural gas business.  At its current run rate, the 


Company’s LNG business will generate HKD 790,500 in revenues over the next year.
2
  Such results are 


unquestionably poor.  China LNG has been a Chinese LNG company for over a year, yet its primary 


operating business is not generating more than HKD 1 million in annual revenues.   





The sum total of its business operations, as of July 13, 2015, is seven agreements to finance the lease of 


1,005 heavy duty LNG vehicles.  It operates out of three brick-and-mortar finance lease offices in Tianjin, 


Zhejiang and Shenzhen.  For a startup such an operating business might be respectable.  For a Company 


with a HKD 16 billion market capitalization, such an operating business is laughable.   





In our opinion, China LNG is a Potemkin village.  Even the cover of its annual report is photo-shopped.  


The Company’s 2014 annual report features a heavy truck parked at an LNG filling station bearing its 


Hong Kong stock ticker.  But this station does not exist because LNG has no operating (or even non-


operating) filling stations.  It is a CGI makeup of a filling station, designed perhaps to give shareholders 


the false sense of security that they are investing in something tangible.  They are not.   





                                                           
2
 The Company’s circular is unclear.  It states that it has been operating its lease financing business since May 2015, but then 


states in the same document that it has entered into seven lease agreement since February 2015.  We will give the Company the 


benefit of the doubt, and assume that its revenues were generated in the two-month period from May to July 2015 (rather than 


February-July) for the purposes of calculating its annual revenue run rate.

China LNG does not even appear to own any significant assets related to the natural gas business.  In fact, 


at FYE 2014, it did not appear to own any meaningful tangible assets in China!  As of its last FYE 


balance sheet, China LNG’s only assets were held-for-trading securities, cash, a few Hong Kong 


investment properties, and HKD 2.17 million (US$ 280,000) of furniture, fixtures, vehicles and leasehold 


improvements.

2) No Intellectual Property, Proprietary Technology or Special Operating Rights. 
 


Nor does China LNG possess any patents, trademarks, copyrights or rights to any technology which 


would give the Company any technological or proprietary advantage in entering a crowded industry.   





At last FYE 2014, it did not even own any exclusive operating licenses or rights in China which would 


give it a protected moat from which to operate filling stations.     





Contrast this with China Tian Lun Gas Holdings Limited (“CTLG”) (HK: 1600), a company that actually 


owns and operates natural gas filling stations and sells natural gas to industrial, commercial and 


residential users.  As of FY 2014, CTLG reported RMB 1.2 billion in intangible assets, made up in part 


by exclusive operating rights and the value of acquired natural gas distribution networks.  








 
Source: CTLG 2014 Annual Report, p. 106. 





By contrast, according to its last FYE balance sheet, China LNG possessed no operating rights or any 


intangible asset of any kind.  This raises the question of how China LNG expects to compete with 


companies like CTLG in a crowded natural gas space.  What competitive advantage can China LNG bring 


to bear on a market where competitors like CTLG have a first-mover advantage and also possess 


significantly more tangible and intangible assets? Perhaps, it is China LNG’s management team’s long 


experience operating a comparable business in a comparable forum? Nope. 





3) No Experience or Expertise 
 


None of China LNG’s senior managers appear to have any experience as an executive, manager or an 


employee at an oil and gas related business.  Rather, China LNG’s senior management consists of four 


accountants and one former branch VP of a Pudong bank.
11 
 


China LNG Group Limited │ HK: 931                                www.glaucusresearch.com 








Chairman and CEO Billy Albert Kan is a stock promoter. His niece and nephew comprise two of the three 


other executive directors, both are certified public accountants.  Li Bo Chen, 65, and appointed as vice 


Chairman in January 2015, has experience in banking and property.   





How can shareholders expect China LNG to compete in a crowded industry against seasoned competitors 


when its management team does not have any experience in the oil and gas business?  





4) Unproven and Flawed Business Model. 
 


To date, the sum total of China LNG’s operating business consists of fluff announcements of non-binding 


cooperation with various established businesses, two newly formed subsidiaries, and a speculative 


business model.   





a. LNG Filling Stations. 
 


The first prong of the Company’s business plan is to enter the downstream market by setting up LNG 


filling stations for heavy vehicles and boats sailing along inland rivers.   





China LNG is likely too late to the game.  Indeed, it is difficult to see any competitive advantage over the 


incumbents who are already grabbing market share in the space.  As of May 2014, when the Company 


pivoted (supposedly) towards the new business, China already had over 1,500 refueling stations for 


vehicles running on natural gas.  Today, the number is even higher.   





We estimate that there are, conservatively, over 2,300 LNG/CNG refilling stations in China, many owned 


and operated by some of the most experienced, well-capitalized brand names in the Chinese energy space.

China LNG Group Limited │ HK: 931                                www.glaucusresearch.com 





Some of China’s biggest energy companies, including KunLun, CNOOC, PetroChina and Sinopec 


already own and operate hundreds of LNG refilling stations.  Other companies, such as CTLG, have 


leveraged an existing brand and network of traditional gasoline refilling stations to penetrate the LNG 


market.   





By comparison, China LNG is undercapitalized, it has no brand name, no existing infrastructure or 


network of refilling stations, and no expertise or experience in establishing or operating filling stations.  





Furthermore, this business requires heavy capital expenditures to purchase land and build out filling 


stations.  Industry estimates range from HKD 11 million to HKD 15 million per heavy vehicle refilling 


station, a significant expenditure for a Company with a tiny balance sheet (HKD 549 million in total 


assets as of FYE 2014), especially considering that almost the Company’s entire cash balance has been 


allocated to vehicle lease financing. 





b. Lease Financing for LNG Vehicles and Equipment. 
  


The second prong of the Company’s proposed business plan is to provide credit to finance the leasing of 


LNG-equipped vehicles, vessels and equipment. 





China LNG has reportedly committed US$ 48 million (HKD 372 million) into the Shanghai bank account 


of its newly formed subsidiary, China LNG Finance Leasing Co, to finance the purchase of LNG vehicles 


and vessels.  This is a large commitment, representing 70% of the Company’s total assets at last FYE.  


As of July 13, 2015, the Company has reportedly established three vehicle leasing offices in Tianjin, 


Zhejiang and Shenzhen and has financed the leases of 1,005 heavy LNG-equipped vehicles.
3
 





China LNG claims that the Chinese banking system will allow the Company to lever up 9 to 1, allowing it 


to lend US$ 480 million.  This idea seems deeply flawed.  China LNG intends to borrow from Chinese 


banks, only to lend out this money to end users to finance the leasing of LNG-equipped equipment and 


vehicles.  Presumably, China LNG intends to turn a profit on this business, so it must lend out at a higher 


rate than it borrows.  Obviously, small to medium sized businesses with good credit will go directly to the 


banks to obtain lower rates, meaning that China LNG will be stuck leasing to higher credit risks (firms 


that cannot go to the banking system) for a tiny yield (the spread between the cost of capital and the 


interest rate of the loans).  This is akin to picking up pennies in front of a train, especially considering that 


China LNG has no experience evaluating credit risk of potential borrowers, or lending in general.   





This is to say nothing of the likely possibility that established auto lenders and banks have a lower 


weighted average cost of capital, and are thus able to finance vehicle leases on better terms than China 


LNG.   





We see no viable commercial reason to suspect that China LNG will be better at finding borrowers, 


evaluating credit, lending, and securing collateral than banks, manufacturers, dealerships and specialist-


auto lenders who are already active in the lease financing market.  After all, financing a lease for a 


heavy truck is the same business whether the truck runs on LNG, diesel or gasoline.   





                                                           
3
 China LNG promises that it is in the process of setting up three more leasing offices and negotiating the leasing of 


approximately 13,980 more heavy duty LNG-equipped trucks.

A 2014 Deloitte study, the China Auto Financing Report, paints an ominous picture of the competitive 


landscape.  Manufacturer-affiliated leasing companies are reportedly prospering, with Volkswagen taking 


over a long-term leasing service in 2013 in Beijing and Shanghai.  Dealerships are “availing themselves 


of the existing networks on their fast track to the booming business, with fleet size and business volume 


outrunning those of normal-sized leasing services.”
4
   





Manufacturers and dealerships have obvious synergies with the leasing business: they can leverage their 


existing brand, infrastructure, expertise (i.e. knowledge of the vehicles), and scale to finance leasing of 


their vehicles.  Financial services supplement their core business, and given enough size, they can borrow 


cheaply from China’s banking system. 





Bank-affiliated leasing companies have the advantage of being well financed.  Their cost of capital is 


probably more favorable than dealerships or manufacturers, even though they may lack the specialized 


knowledge of the leased vehicles.  CDB Leasing is the leader in this sector: it has already leased 


thousands of vehicles and forged partnerships worth RMB 8.4 billion with 11 premier manufacturers.
5
   





Independent financial leasing firms have it more difficult, yet a few such firms (including Herald Leasing) 


are pushing a first mover advantage.  





China LNG is in by far the worst competitive position.  They are poorly financed (an understatement), 


and lack the access to capital of bank-affiliated leasing companies.  They have no specialized knowledge 


of the industry or the vehicles, and cannot leverage a leasing business off of an already established brand, 


salesforce or infrastructure like manufacturers or dealerships.  Other financial leasing companies are also 


way ahead of China LNG: with scale and expertise, their cost of capital is bound to be lower, and they are 


already establishing the brand, network and acumen to survive in a harsh competitive environment.   





c. Sinopec: China LNG is NOT China Gas (HK: 384). 
 


The bull case for China LNG, such as it is, revolves around a presumed future relationship with Sinopec. 


In 2004, Chairman Billy Kan apparently brokered a deal between China Gas Holdings (HK: 384) (“China 


Gas”) and Sinopec, pursuant to which the state owned behemoth purchased a 10% stake in China Gas.  


For his efforts, Billy Albert Kan was awarded 180,000,000 in warrants issued by China Gas.   





Apparently, Billy Albert Kan is touting his relationship with Sinopec and holding out the promise China 


LNG will strike a similar arrangement with the state-owned energy giant.  On November 25, 2014, China 


LNG announced a non-binding framework agreement with Sinopec regarding the development of LNG 


refueling stations and application of LNG heavy trucks in the PRC.

But any shareholder looking to China Gas as a parallel should look elsewhere.  First, Sinopec’s 


investment in China Gas was at much more favorable price.  Sinopec acquired a 10% stake in China Gas 


in October 2004, at a time when China Gas’s stock was trading at a price to book value of 3.16x.  While 


this price was certainly expensive (energy companies usually trade between 1-2x book value), it is 


nothing compared to the overvaluation of China LNG’s shares today. 





Just as important, Sinopec’s investment in, and cooperation with, China Gas came after China Gas had 


already developed a substantial and profitable operating business.  In FY 2005, at the time of Billy 


Kan’s involvement and Sinopec’s acquisition of 10% of its business, China Gas had an existing network 


of gas pipelines which was already servicing a wide array of residential and commercial customers.  


China Gas reported FY 2005 revenues of HKD 410 million, net profits of HKD 132 million, exclusive 


operating rights in a number of areas, and over HKD 2.7 billion in assets on its balance sheet.   





By comparison, China LNG’s shares are outrageously expensive (33.9x book) and it has a miniscule 


operating business.  Also, Sinopec’s involvement in China Gas came at a time when the state owned 


enterprise was looking to diversify into the natural gas market.  Today, that market is saturated, and 


reports suggest Sinopec is offloading natural gas assets. 





Regardless of Sinopec’s long term plans in the natural gas industry, it is unclear what value, if any, China 


LNG could bring to the deal.  Why would Sinopec be interested in teaming with a business which exists 


only on paper and whose officers and executives have neither the balance sheet, experience nor 


competitive advantage to provide any relative value to the Chinese state owned energy giant?  Perhaps 


that is the reason that any proposed contract remains non-binding and the details of any proposed 


cooperation remain fuzzy.   





The announcement of the non-binding framework agreement suggested that China LNG and Sinopec 


would cooperate on two pilots programs for the development of LNG refueling stations along two PRC 


highways.  Yet China LNG’s role and value add are unclear.   





The announcement states that Sinopec will design and build the refueling stations as well as supply LNG 


at a preferential price to China LNG.  By contrast, China LNG is responsible “for the provision of funding 


to its customers to translate their heavy trucks from using fuel to LNG and provision of finance leasing 


services to its customers for purchasing new LNG heavy trucks from the Company.”
6
 





Oddly, China LNG has promised to invest “not less than 100,000 LNG heavy trucks directly and not less 


than 200,000 heavy trucks indirectly at the end of year 2020 in order to provide long-term support” to 


Sinopec.  China LNG has also guaranteed certain minimum retail sales of LNG to the refueling stations.  


The announcement concludes, optimistically, that “as the value of investment in 300,000 LNG heavy 


trucks could amount to over RMB 100 billion, the Company decided to enter” the framework agreement 


in relation to the cooperation in the development of LNG refueling stations with Sinopec.

The most optimistic projections predict 800,000 LNG equipped vehicles in China by 2020.  But even 


assuming that such rosy projections come true, the notion that China LNG, with no balance sheet, 


experience, operating business or brand will provide or finance 300,000 such vehicles (37.5%) is absurd.   





In addition, how will China LNG supply LNG equipped trucks: 100,000 directly, and 200,000 indirectly?  


Does it intend to finance the retro-fitting of existing trucks? Finance the purchase of new trucks? Where 


will it find the money to do so? What competitive advantage will it have in this business over truck 


manufacturers, dealerships, dedicated and established vehicle leasing companies, banks, or energy 


companies?  





Ultimately, the agreement with Sinopec is no agreement at all.  It is simply a vague, flawed plan to 


cooperate in the future.  China LNG does not have the balance sheet, operating experience or 


infrastructure to fulfill their end of the proposed cooperation, so we have serious doubts about Sinopec’s 


level of interest.  





d. History of Illusory Cooperation Agreements.  
 


Since March 2014, China LNG has announced 20 non-binding, letters of intent or cooperation 


agreements with various companies, commissions and development groups.  Although such cooperation 


agreements give investors the impression that China LNG is making significant progress in the LNG 


business, this impression is illusory. 





In an effort to hold the Company accountable for its announcements, and to demonstrate the illusory 


nature of its proposed investments and promises, in the following table we have listed each proposed 


agreement, including the date and China LNG’s proposed capital investment.

To our knowledge, not a single one of the 20 non-binding agreements has led to a concrete, 


contractual business relationship or investment.  Nor are China LNG’s promises under such 


announcements realistic.   





For example, from March through June 2014, China LNG made five separate announcements of such 


non-binding framework agreements, promising to invest a total of HKD 5 billion, which was obviously 


impossible given that the Company’s balance sheet recorded only HKD 549 million in total assets as of 


FYE 2014.  It has been over a year since these five announcements, and to our knowledge not one such 


proposed investment has come to fruition.   





The recently announced cooperation agreement with Linyi Trade City Administrative Commission is 


emblematic of the illusory nature of China LNG’s proposed investments.  In the non-binding agreement, 


China LNG  promises to invest HKD 2.5 billion in a subsidiary to construct LNG fueling stations, 


portable LNG charging cars, LNG central stations, a gas pipeline and a liquefaction plant and distribution 


system. We are skeptical.  China LNG has never purchased, operated or built a liquefaction plant or an 


LNG charging car – why would anyone hire them to do so now when a number of other companies have 


establish operations and expertise in the industry?  With most of its limited capital committed to vehicle 


leasing, how will China LNG finance such investments?  





Unbelievably, the non-binding agreement also commits China LNG to invest HKD 10-63 billion in a 


subsidiary to provide lease financing services for local logistics companies, industrial and civilian boiler 


operators looking to refit boilers from coal to LNG, the construction of a local LNG bus network and 


vehicles and equipment for the city.  Such proposed investments are laughable considering China LNG 


has HKD 549 million in total assets at last FYE.    





We suspect that the function of such announcements is simply to promote the illusion of progress and 


maintain the fiction that China LNG will develop an LNG business in China.   





In total, the Company’s non-binding agreements call on it to commit between HKD 14 billion and HKD 


71 billion in investments into the LNG business, a farcical amount of capital considering the Company’s 


tiny balance sheet and limited operating history.  





5)  History of Failed New Businesses. 





Nor does the Company’s record of entrepreneurship inspire confidence.  The Company’s pivot towards 


natural gas represents its fifth new business since 2007, when Chairman Billy Albert Kan became 


involved.   





Since 2006, the Company has tried and failed at: the distribution of computer components and IT 


products, provision of IT solutions, trading of securities, property development and finally, the LNG 


business.

Why would it be different this time? Management’s repeated failure to successfully launch new 


businesses casts further doubt on the viability of its entry into the crowded LNG space.

JUNK BONDS RETURN 375% IN SIX MONTHS 


99% of China LNG’s 2014 revenue was derived from a one-off related party bond deal.
 7


  In January 


2014, China LNG purchased from its Chairman HKD 80 million in convertible bonds issued by Warderly 


International (HK: 0607) (the “Warderly Bonds”).   





In June 2014, China LNG agreed to sell the Warderly Bonds to Magnolia Wealth International Limited 


(“Magnolia”) for HKD 380 million, a 375% profit in just six months.  China LNG’s return on its 


investment was only due to the fact that the Chairman sold the Company the Warderly Bonds at well 


below market value.  This should not be considered recurring revenue and thus should not factor into the 


Company’s valuation.    





1) Warderly’s Troubled Past 
 


Warderly is a Hong Kong-listed penny stock which went bust 2007 and whose shares were then 


suspended from trading until 2013.
8
  But its history is critical to understanding Billy Albert Kan and the 


Warderly Bonds that were purportedly such a lucrative deal for China LNG.   





On May 14, 2007, Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) suspended trading in Warderly’s shares 


amid growing speculation that the company was insolvent and had made material misrepresentations to its 


investors.  Following the suspension, multiple directors (including the Chairman) resigned, as did 


Warderly’s auditor, Deloitte & Touche Tomatsu.  Creditors seized Warderly’s factory.  The SFC then 


pursued charges (including disqualification from future service for a public company) against six former 


directors, including Warderly’s Chairman and founder KW Yeung, for breach of fiduciary duties and 


misleading disclosures.
9
 





In 2008, China LNG Chairman Billy Albert Kan purchased a 36% ownership stake in Warderly and 


brought in his own directors.  At the time, Warderly was a shell teetering on insolvency whose electronics 


factory had been seized and which owed significant debt to creditors.  Nevertheless, in September 2008, 


Kan submitted a proposal to the HKEX and the SFC for the resumption of trading under the guise of a 


proposed restructuring.
10


  Rather than an electronics manufacturer, Warderly proposed to resume business 


a trader and distributor of electronic products.   





The SFC and the HKEX refused to relist the company, and commenced de-listing proceedings against 


Warderly.  On May 13, 2011, despite multiple attempts by the company to resume trading and relist, the 


HKEX notified Warderly that it intended to delist the company because Billy Albert Kan’s business had 


not “demonstrated with sufficiency of operation or assets required by the listing rules.”
11


  Warderly 


continued to appeal, but the HKEX and SFC continued to refuse its re-listing application.  Billy Albert 


Kan’s only choice was to sell the business (or what remained of it). 





In December 2013, Warderly consummated a reverse merger with a Chinese-based residential property 


developer owned by Magnolia (and its Chairman Ji Changqun).
12


  As part of the deal, Warderly issued 


HKD 500 million in convertible bonds, bearing an annual interest rate of 2% and a conversion price of 


HKD 0.05 per share.  The bonds were convertible only upon maturity, five years from the date of 


issuance (December 2018).  HKD 420 million of the bonds were issued to Magnolia, and HKD 80 


                                                           
7
 China LNG owns a few properties in Hong Kong, a vestige of its attempt at property development, but such properties brought 


in only HKD 840,000 in revenue in FY 2014.

million were issued to Billy Albert Kan.
13


  These are the bonds that would prove to be so lucrative to 


China LNG.   





Following the reverse merger, Billy Albert Kan and his directors, all of whom also worked at China LNG, 


resigned:  








In January 2014, just one month after the Warderly Bonds were issued to Billy Albert Kan at a conversion 


price of HKD 0.05, China LNG purchased the bonds from Billy Albert Kan for par value, HKD 80 


million.  Six months later, China LNG reportedly sold the bonds to Warderly’s controlling shareholder 


and related party, Magnolia, for a 375% profit.   





2) No Explanation for 375% Appreciation 
 


The Warderly Bonds were convertible at HKD 0.05 per share.  Given that Warderly’s shares were trading 


at well above the strike price, the value of the bonds should theoretically have been tied to the underlying 


price of Warderly’s stock.   





But from January 20, 2014, when China LNG purchased the Warderly Bonds from its Chairman, and 


June 21, 2014, when China LNG agreed to sell the bonds to Magnolia, the price of Warderly shares 


declined 34.4% from HKD 0.38 per share to HKD 0.24 per share! 





 
Given that Warderly’s share price declined 34.4% during the period in which China LNG owned the 


Warderly Bonds, we see no reason that the value of the bonds would increase 375% during that time.

If the Warderly Bonds were truly worth HKD 380 million in June 2014, they were certainly worth more 


than that amount in January 2014, when China LNG’s Chairman sold them to the Company for only 


HKD 80 million.  This begs the question – why didn’t China LNG’s Chairman sell the bonds at their 


‘market’ price to Magnolia in January 2014? Why did he forego an easy profit by transferring the 


Warderly Bonds at par value to China LNG?  





The transaction raises questions given that China LNG purchased the bonds from its Chairman, and the 


bonds were issued as part of a reverse merger to re-list a deeply troubled Company that the SFC and 


HKEX refused to allow back on the exchange for seven years.  





The transaction steps also raise a red flag.  If China LNG was going to purchase the Warderly Bonds at 


par almost immediately after their issuance to its Chairman, why would China LNG not simply subscribe 


to the Warderly Bonds directly? It would be simpler – instead of transferring HKD 80 million to its 


Chairman, it could have just subscribed for the same amount of bonds directly from Warderly.   





One thing is certain.  For the purposes of valuing China LNG, its 2014 revenues, derived almost 


exclusively from a one-off related party bond deal, are not recurring and should not be factored into the 


Company’s stock price going forward.  A single sweetheart bond deal with the Chairman will not yield 


future earnings.   





Ultimately, China LNG, as its name suggests, must therefore be valued on its natural gas business in 


China.  Or lack thereof.     





VALUATION 





China LNG is a penny stock whose valuation has soared because of a cosmetic re-branding as a Chinese 


LNG company.   The Company currently trades at 33.9x price/book value.  Yet China LNG is essentially 


a startup without any proprietary intellectual property, a meaningful operating business or tangible 


experience in the industry.  As such, we believe that it should be valued at or very close to 1.79x book 


value (the average for HK and global energy comps).  We think the Company is worth HKD 0.08 per 


share, 95% below China LNG’s last traded price.
