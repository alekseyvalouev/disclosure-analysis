Summary:  Chicken Soup for the Soul
Entertainment, Inc. Cl A (CSSE)


A charity that the CEO advises accounted for approximately 46% of 2016 revenue and 95% of


2015 revenue through “sponsorship” of the public entity’s television programs.


The charity was created in 2015, mere months after the creation of CSSE itself. The company


later “donated” shares back to the charity. We have concerns about this relationship.


The company reported a change in accounting methodology the day of an announced


acquisition, positioning it to record a dubious $22.2 million paper “gain on bargain purchase”


from the deal.


CSSE is bizarrely structured as a subsidiary of a subsidiary and pays numerous fees to its


a�liates. Public investors receive no proceeds from the popular book series.


The CEO of CSSE was formerly CEO of Winstar, a public company that declared bankruptcy


amidst allegations of revenue falsi�cation and accounting improprieties.


Introduction


ChickenSoup Entertainment (CSSE (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/CSSE)) raised $30 million in


August 2017 via a crowdsourced IPO (https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/18/chicken-soup-for-the-soul-


entertainment-begins-trading-on-nasdaq.html) under the new Reg A+ framework Privacy  - Terms


Chicken Soup For the Soul Entertainment Is A
Toxic Mess

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
(https://www.nyse.com/regulation-a), which has “lower[ed] regulatory hurdles for companies trying


to go public”.


The o�ering was among the more noteworthy of the new Reg A+ IPOs partly because of the well-


known brand Chicken Soup for the Soul and partly because of the company’s a�liation with Ashton


Kutcher (https://www.inc.com/business-insider/publishing-company-ashton-kutcher-goes-


public.html). The company was o�ering a unique business model, with the CEO stating


(https://news.avclub.com/ashton-kutcher-to-help-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-become-


1798264104) the company was poised to become “the Net�ix for inspirational content.”


Additionally, CSSE reported strong revenue and earnings growth heading into its IPO.


Despite the alluring headlines, however, our analysis indicates that much of the reported revenue


and earnings appear to be derived from a newly formed non-pro�t organization that seems to exist


almost solely to support ChickenSoup. We have uncovered red �ags indicating that the true nature


of the relationship between CSSE and the non-pro�t in question – the Boniuk Foundation – may


have been under-reported to public investors.


Calling the �nancial results into further question, late last year, the company reported an


accounting change in its quarterly �ling that would allow it to book a “gain on bargain purchase”.


That same day, the company announced an acquisition that it determined to be a bargain


purchase. The accounting change has positioned the company to recognize a $22.2 million paper


gain on an acquisition that only cost roughly $5 million. Our review of the acquisition leaves us with


doubts about the validity of this supposed gain.


Collectively, we have doubts about the credibility and sustainability of the company’s reported


revenue, earnings, and adjusted EBITDA metrics.


We believe investors have been attracted to the Chicken Soup for the Soul brand and to the


company’s a�liation with Ashton Kutcher without fully understanding the nature of the


associations. Much of the media surrounding the IPO seemed to con�ate the relationship between


the company, Ashton Kutcher, and the book series (see examples here


(https://www.inc.com/business-insider/publishing-company-ashton-kutcher-goes-public.html), here


(https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/18/chicken-soup-for-the-soul-entertainment-begins-trading-on-

become-1798264104), and here (https://www.cbsnews.com/news/chicken-soup-for-the-soul-goes-


public-ipo/)). The presentation


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417046436/v474591_ex99-1.htm) by


the company similarly could be confusing to the average reader as it does not make all the details


of the a�liate relationships clear.

When digging into the o�ering documents


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417043808/v473531_253g1.htm), we


see that the public entity is actually a subsidiary of a subsidiary that is merely focused on video


content and is therefore to receive no proceeds from the parent company’s book sales. Also, the


business founded by Ashton Kutcher, “A Plus”, is actually a separate entity that public investors


have no stake in.


Worse yet, according to the o�ering documents, the public entity must pay its own a�liates


“management services” fees for things like access to its own CEO, and licensing and distribution


fees for use of the Chicken Soup brand and for distribution through Kutcher’s A Plus.


The Chairman and CEO of CSSE, William J. Rouhana, Jr. has a controversial history. Rouhana


previously served as CEO and Chairman of Winstar Communications, Inc., a formerly NASDAQ-listed


technology company that declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy following the bursting of the dotcom


bubble and amidst a lawsuit that alleged severe accounting improprieties


(https://www.leagle.com/decision/2005582348br2341565). The blow-up of Winstar reportedly


(https://www.law360.com/articles/457300/grant-thornton-to-pay-10m-in-winstar-fraud-


settlement) led to as much as $974 million in investor losses.


Rouhana has voting control over the public company and similarly has control over the ultimate


parent, thereby giving him virtually unmitigated control of the entire corporate structure. We have


little faith in his ability to create genuine value for shareholders given his track record and all of the


foregoing red �ags.


A Newly Formed Non-Pro�t Advised by the CEO
Accounts for a Substantial Portion of Revenue
and Earnings

CSSE presents the company in a very attractive light. In the summary, the company stated “Since


our inception in January 2015, our business has grown rapidly and is pro�table.” The summary


�nancials show a young company that has achieved year-over-year revenue growth of 438% has


recently turned pro�table and has strong pro�t and EBITDA margins:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
On the surface, these numbers appear to be glowingly attractive and on a meteoric growth


trajectory. The notes, however, show that a signi�cant portion of that revenue was derived from a


single unnamed non-pro�t foundation that Rouhana advises (note 11, Pg F-24


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417043808/v473531_253g1.htm)):


“CSS and the Company have several agreements with the Foundation, on whose advisory


board the Company’s chief executive o�cer sits. One such agreement includes


sponsorship by the Foundation for a Saturday morning family television show… For the


years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, the Company recognized revenue of


$3,734,884 and $1,431,818, respectively, from this sponsorship.”


The O�ering Circular identi�es the show as being “Hidden Heroes” (page F-13). Rouhana, therefore,


sits on the advisory board of a foundation that sponsors the creation of Hidden Heroes – a


foundation whose very sponsorship represented about 95% of the CSSE’s 2015 revenue and 46% of


the Company’s 2016 revenue.


A separate press release (http://theboniukfoundation.org/hidden-heroes-foundation-sponsors-


new-series-on-cbs/) and subsequent �lings identi�ed the Boniuk Foundation as the primary


sponsor (http://ir.cssentertainment.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=254575&p=irol-


newsArticle&ID=2302928) of the show. Our review of the Boniuk Foundation revealed several red


�ags:


First, an IRS database search (https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-pro�ts/exempt-organizations-


business-master-�le-extract-eo-bmf) reveals that the Boniuk Foundation was ruled tax exempt in


April 2015, suggesting that the organization is new and virtually coincides with the creation of CSSE


itself (in January 2015).

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Second, rather than being a diversi�ed foundation involved in multiple interests, it appears that the


Boniuk Foundation is dedicated largely to sponsoring CSSE, its predecessor entity CSS Productions,


and a�liates. The Boniuk Foundation’s 2014 Form 990


(http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2014/465/204/2014-465204546-0c1c7391-9.pdf) �ling


states that:


“[t]he companies [sic] most signi�cant activities include distribution of books to various


schools in Harris County TX school book sets and creating a children’s television program.”


The document later clari�es that CSSE’s parent entities produce books it distributes, stating that


“[a]greement made with ChickenSoup for publishing books for distribution for distribution to


Houston independent school district.”


Presumably, Hidden Heroes is the “children’s television program” mentioned in the �ling. In sum, it


therefore appears that both of its “signi�cant” activities are relating to its role supporting


ChickenSoup. In all, the total revenue for the Boniuk Foundation for its 2014


(http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2014/465/204/2014-465204546-0c1c7391-9.pdf) and 2015


(http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2015/465/204/2015-465204546-0d45744c-9.pdf) �scal


years was a combined $4,870,236, further underscoring that it is not a large, well-diversi�ed


foundation. The millions directed toward CSSE clearly represent a substantial portion of the


foundation’s donation activity.


Third, rather than Boniuk simply acting as a one-way charitable donor to the company, the 2015


Form 990 (http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2015/465/204/2015-465204546-0d45744c-


9.pdf) �ling shows the foundation may have had a two-way interest with CSSE. Speci�cally, the


second to last page of that document re�ects that a Class A membership interest in Chicken Soup


for the Soul Production, LLC (the predecessor entity to CSSE) was contributed to the entity:


The O�ering Circular appears to corroborate that information, stating:


“On September 30, 2015, CSS made a charitable donation of 6% of the membership


interests it owned in CSS Productions to the Foundation.” [emphasis added]

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We have a hard time believing that the Boniuk Foundation just simply (I) formed right around the


same time CSSE, (II) directed much and potentially the majority of its donations to CSSE and


a�liates (III) decided to donate so extensively to CSSE that it comprised the majority of the (for-


pro�t) company’s revenue, then (IV) months later, in an unrelated act of charity and kindness, the


company decided to donate 6% of its shares to the foundation. Note that the IRS de�nes


(https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p526.pdf) a “charitable contribution” as being “voluntary and is


made without getting, or expecting to get, anything of equal value.”


If the above weren’t odd enough, the director of the Boniuk Foundation, Milton Boniuk, already has


another fairly new and similarly named foundation, the Boniuk Charitable Foundation (“BCF”), which


gained tax exempt status in September 2014, less than a year earlier. We were a bit confused as to


why Boniuk would need another personal foundation seemingly dedicated to ChickenSoup when


he had already recently established a personal foundation.


When we examined BCF, we noticed some parallels to the Boniuk Foundation. Virtually, all of BCF’s


assets from its 2014 990 �ling (http://www.guidestar.org/FinDocuments/2014/421/628/2014-


421628436-0c1574da-F.pdf) consisted of investments in convertible debentures and equity in a


company called NanoViricides, Inc. (NYSEMKT:NNVC (https://seekingalpha.com/symbol/NNVC)), a


company which Boniuk has sat as director


(http://www.nanoviricides.com/press%20releases/2013/NanoViricides%20Appoints%20Baylor%20P


rofessor%20Dr.%20Milton%20Boniuk%20as%20an%20Independent%20Board%20Member.html) si


nce May 2013:


Notably, while BCF met its qualifying distribution in 2013 and 2015 by donating a collective


$157,000 to Rice University, in 2014 BCF met its qualifying distribution by donating $150,000 to the


Boniuk Foundation, which could have been directed right back into CSSE and its a�liates.


Taken all together, in our opinion, the above looks similar to Boniuk making an investment (tax-free)


in shares of CSSE rather providing a mere arms-length source of revenue to the business. At the


very least, we believe a case can be made that the Boniuk Foundation should be a consolidated


entity and therefore eliminate what appear to be inter-company transactions rather than booking


them as revenue.

We �nd CSSE’s relationship to the Boniuk Foundation to be unsettling. We also have our doubts


about the sustainability of the arrangement. We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked the


following:


Whether CSSE, its executives, its a�liates, or its key investors have been or plan to be donors


to the Boniuk Foundation?


How much of the Boniuk Foundation’s activity has been focused on CSSE and its a�liates?


Was the 6% donation of shares by CSS to the Boniuk Foundation voluntary and made without


getting, or expecting to get, anything of equal value (such as past and/or future sponsorship


revenue)?


We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply from the company, we will


update this accordingly.


The Company is Poised to Book a Massive Paper
“Gain on Bargain Purchase” Due to a Recent
Accounting Change


On November 6, 2017, CSSE announced

television shows and �lms, and (II) Popcorn�ix


(https://www.popcorn�ix.com/pages/home/hm/home), an ad-based over-the-top (OTT) platform


that allows users to watch movies and TV shows for free. The purchase price for Screen Media


consisted of about $4.9 million in cash (plus transaction costs), 35,000 shares of Class A common


stock, and warrants to purchase 50,000 shares of CSSE at $12 per share.


In the 10-Q �led on November 6th


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417056355/tv477970_10q.htm) – the


same day of the Screen Media acquisition announcement – new language appeared that altered the


company’s de�nition of adjusted EBITDA to include “the gain on bargain purchase of subsidiary”.


(Note that the previous 10-Q


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417050946/v476124_10q.htm) had

appeared.)

discount to its appraised value, intrinsic value and replacement cost” of the company, and how it


now expected the company’s Q4 2017 adjusted EBITDA to “substantially exceed $10 million.” The


press release did not clarify that the upward revision to its adjusted EBITDA could include booking a


gain on purchase from the acquisition.


Taking things a step further, a later company press release on January 17 


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420418002485/tv483489_ex99-


6.htm)highlighted that CSSE had commissioned a new valuation opinion as part of the transaction


and – lo and behold – it determined that the assets were valued yet even higher, at $31.4 million.


Additionally, the company made clear that it would recognize the massive gain on purchase in its


statement of operations:


“Re�ecting the excess of the net appraised value of the assets over their purchase price as


set forth in the Valuation Opinion, CSS Entertainment will recognize a non-cash gain in its


Statement of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2017 of approximately $22.2


million.” [emphasis added]


We are uninspired by the company’s subtle accounting methodology change that suddenly allows it


to recognize an immediate ~440% gain on purchase. The new accounting implementation could


give rise to a splashy “headline” that reports explosive quarterly and annual results, but our review


of the acquisition leaves us to believe that such numbers would represent little real value beyond


optics.


We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked them to describe the basis for the adjusted EBITDA


methodology change that includes a “gain on bargain purchase” which we believe to be neither


reasonable nor sustainable. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply


from the company, we will update this accordingly.


Screen Media Acquisition: Reality Check


Digging down on the acquisition, we examined Screen Media more closely and came away with


questions about the credibility of the lofty appraisal results that CSSE had commissioned.

of the transaction, which corresponds to the $4.9 million in cash


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417056357/tv478694_ex99-


1.htm) paid as part of the o�ering (net of transaction and closing costs).


Given that the private equity backers seemingly allowed the entity to be acquired for the cost of


bank debt plus some modest share-based upside that went to the former CEO, we can’t help but


wonder whether the business has the signi�cant value claimed in the appraisal. Had the assets truly


been worth over $31 million, wouldn’t a sale process have yielded more than ~$5 million?


Furthermore, could there really be that much value unlocked by Screen Media’s combination with


CSSE which is itself a �edgling media company? We have a hard time fathoming how CSSE’s line up


of relatively obscure TV shows would do much to enhance Screen Media’s line-up of relatively


obscure movies and TV shows.


We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked the following:


“Did Screen Media run a sale process? If so, how many potential buyers were contacted


and how many bids were received. If not, why?”


We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply from the company, we will


update this accordingly.


The Public Entity is a Subsidiary of a Subsidiary


Aside from our questions around the credibility and sustainability of revenue, earnings and


adjusted EBITDA metrics, we have identi�ed other red �ags. First, CSSE is the subsidiary of a


subsidiary, a highly unusual structure for any public company, let alone a company of such modest


size as CSSE:


Per the latest 10-Q


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417056355/tv477970_10q.htm),


CSSE was originally formed under CSS Productions, LLC. That entity was formed by Chicken Soup


for the Soul, LLC, “a publishing and consumer products company” that initiated operations in


January 2015. That entity in turn is owned by Chicken Soup for the Soul Holdings, LLC, which is the


“ultimate parent” to all of the aforementioned entities.


We �nd it unsettling that public investors are buried underneath several layers within a complex


corporate structure rather than simply having a share of the entire success of the overall business.

Both the “ultimate parent” and the public entity are controlled by the same individual, William


Rouhana. Rouhana controls approximately 96.8%

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417056355/tv477970_10q.htm) of


CSSE’s entire issued share base as of the most recent 10-Q.


We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked for explanation on why CSSE was structured as a


subsidiary of a subsidiary rather than in a manner where public investors could share in the gains


and losses of the entire business. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a


reply from the company, we will update this accordingly.


An Abundance of Related-Party Transactions and
Fees


The shared control is troublesome, especially in light of the mind-boggling number of related party


transactions and fees paid between related party entities. A partial rundown of the list, per the 10-


Qs and the o�ering circular (note that some of these fees are overlapping):


The o�ering circular plainly states that “[a]t least 10% of [CSSE’s] gross revenue will be paid to


[its] a�liates on a continuous basis and will not be otherwise available to [CSSE].”


CSSE paid related party A Plus, the Ashton Kutcher-founded entity an advance of $3 million


under a distribution agreement.


CSSE paid its parent, CSS a one-time license fee of $5,000,000.


About $8.6 million of the CSSE o�ering proceeds appear to have been designated to pay down


existing debt which, in turn, appears to have been held largely by management and insiders.


On August 21, the company paid to its parent $1,311,594 in owed “management” and “license”


fees, per page 31 of the June 10-Q


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1679063/000114420417050946/v476124_10q.htm).


Overall, CSSE pays a management fee to its parent, recurring licensing fees to its parent,


marketing fees to its parent, and sales commissions to its parent.


CEO Rouhana’s son has not one but two di�erent consulting companies that CSSE has paid:


“Low Pro�le” received $95,000 over the two years since inception and “One Last Thing LLC”


received $100,000.


We can’t fathom how a small company like CSSE can credibly justify the amount of money


circulating to related parties amidst its complex corporate structure.


We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked for explanation on why the company must pay


numerous fees to its a�liates, including for things like access to its own CEO and management


team. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a reply from the company, we

CEO William Rouhana’s Role in the Winstar
Debacle


We looked into Rouhana’s background as Chairman and CEO of Winstar in order to get a sense of


his leadership and management abilities. We found that subsequent to the collapse and bankruptcy


of Winstar, a class-action lawsuit was �led against its o�cers, directors, and its accountant Grant


Thornton, alleging severe accounting improprieties and the creation of false revenue. Among other


things, the Winstar lawsuit (http://securities.stanford.edu/�lings-


documents/1017/WCII01/2002325_r01c_01-03014.pdf) alleged that:


“Senior management – including each member of the Company’s senior management team


named as a defendant [including Rouhana] – engaged in covert practices designed to bene�t


themselves at the expense of the Company and its investors”;


“Defendants Rouhana and Kantor knowingly allowed numerous related parties to utilize


Company assets without paying for them”;


“Management encouraged sales personnel to fabricate customer information, by agreeing to


pay commissions on such fabricated sales”;


“Notwithstanding the extraordinary problems being experienced by Winstar, Defendants


actively covered-up any hint of accounting problems and actively promoted the Company as


experiencing strong growth and improved �nancial controls”; and


“Winstar defendants routinely encouraged or tacitly allowed sales personnel to engage in


overt sales falsi�cation, in a deliberate e�ort to overstate sales”.


Note that the allegations were never proven in court as Rouhana and the other defendants settled


without any admission of wrongdoing. The individual defendants collectively settled for a sum of


$25 million according to the settlement agreement


(https://www.slideshare.net/HindenburgResearch/2006-1206-winstar-proposed-settlements) (Pg.


74):


Later in 2013, Grant Thornton paid $10 million (https://www.law360.com/articles/457300/grant-

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We �nd the above to be troubling. Given that Rouhana controls both the private parent entity and


the public subsidiary, he may have been in a position to e�ectively negotiate the related party fees


with himself or to exert overwhelming in�uence in the process.


We emailed CSSE’s investor relations and asked who negotiated the fees on behalf of the public


entity and the private parent entity. We have not heard back as of this writing. Should we receive a


reply from the company, we will update this accordingly.


CSSE’s Auditor Has a Remarkable Lack of
Experience Auditing Public Companies


Giving us yet more cause for concern, CSSE’s auditor appears to have virtually no experience


auditing public companies, let alone those with complex structures. The latest 2017 PCAOB report


(https://rasr.pcaobus.org/Firms/FirmSummaryPublic.aspx?


FirmID=C802598F623E9DF9BAA28FA01079F3CD) from CSSE’s auditor, Rosen�eld & Co PLLC, shows


that the �rm had audited no public companies during the reported period and had no substantial


role in the preparation or furnishing an audit report with respect to a public issuer during the


reporting period.


Conclusion: A Soupy Mess


Despite the wholesome sounding name, we believe ChickenSoup Entertainment has all the key


hallmarks of a disaster in the making. While we expect the reported numbers to be glowing in the


near future, we believe the company is on a road toward inevitable ruin.
