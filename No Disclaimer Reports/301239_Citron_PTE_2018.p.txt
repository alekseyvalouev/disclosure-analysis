Citron Exposes History of FRAUD Behind PolarityTE…. 
That is right…we said it – FRAUD 
 
The SEC should halt this stock immediately before insiders are allowed to enrich themselves 
even more as the company continues to deceive investors. 
 
This is part 1 of a 2 part series.  Citron will not discuss the science behind PolarityTE in this 
report because it is irrelevant.  Once an SEC investigation commences, we expect all the 
“figureheads” who have prostituted their names for S-8 stock to immediately lawyer up and 
scatter like cockroaches. 
 
For those of you unfamiliar with the story here is the pitch in two lines: PolarityTe is a 
development stage company that has developed revolutionary wound care treatments 
through the intellectual property of a group of John Hopkins doctors. This intellectual 
property was acquired by a group of serial stock promoters and comes in the form of a patent 
application.  Think of Mimedx with no sales.  
 
 
Premeditated Securities Fraud? 
 
Here at a quick timeline:  
 
On December 1, 2016, Majesco Entertainment whole owned by notorious investor Barry 
Honig entered into an agreement to acquire the assets of PolarityTe.   
 
Polarity is the brainchild of Johns Hopkins doctor Denver Lough through his patent application 
#14/954,335.   As described in correspondence to the SEC regarding the nature of the 
acquisition- IT IS ALL ABOUT THE PATENT. 
 


 
 
 
On Apr 7, 2017, COOL announced the closing of the transaction where Majesco gave Dr. 
Lough over $104 million in stock for the patent. 
 
 
 
 


“There was never any intent to acquire an ongoing business and no ongoing business 
was acquired. The asset is preserved in a stand-alone entity merely as a vehicle to provide 
the Company a seamless means to acquire the asset (a patent application) without undue 
cost, expense and time. Polarity NV has never had employees and therefore no employees 
will be acquired for the transaction.” 10Q Jan 31, 2017

BUT WAIT 
 
Just one week beforehand, on March 31, 2017, Dr Lough received a notice of non-final 
REJECTION of the patent and the actual letter from the USPTO was put in the mail on the 
same date the transaction closed April 7.  All without being disclosed to shareholders.   
 
Below is the timeline cut and pasted from the USPTO website patent # 14/954,335

Yet 
 
The SEC, like they had a crystal ball, sent a letter to Polarity the next week that read:

Published June 25th, 2018 


Yet, the company continued to promote themselves and raise money as if the rejection never 
occurred. 
 
There was no 8-k, risk disclosure, or press release as the coveted patent entered the stock 
world dead on arrival. 
 
PolarityTE would continue to correspond with the SEC for the next year and file registration 
statements, prospectus, and annual reports without EVER disclosing the rejection of the 
patent.  Instead, they would use boilerplate language such as: 
 


 
 
Meanwhile, the hubris of the stock promoters and management didn't stop, as press releases 
and interviews continued to refer to this alleged “patented” invention.  For those who want 
to see it just got to 1:55 of this interview

Citron will make a dossier of the misrepresentations and turn them over to the SEC and the 
class action attorneys once they get subpoenaed.   
 
Now you have read the nice part – but it only gets worse. 
 
It gets worse!! 
 
If the company and its promoters had to defend themselves they might say, ‘It was only a 
preliminary rejection and we thought we could win on appeal’ (despite the odds being in the 
low single digits). 
 
On May 29, 2018 the company filed an S-8 registration, which would allow management and 
promoters to sell hundreds of millions of dollars in stock.   
 


"Intellectual property risk: As a minimally manipulated therapy, SkinTE is developed 
through a series of trade secrets and pending patents that prevent full replication of the 
process."

Note that former COOL CFO John Stetson was the CFO of the same “gang's” last patent stock 
$MARA…which now trades at $1, despite it once trading at $39 a share with the winds of a 
strong promotion.   


 
In only four working days after the S-8 was filed, on June 4, 2018,  the USPTO gave a final 
rejection for “the patent”.  Citron believes that Dr. Lough was very aware of the likelihood of 
the upcoming rejection and rushed to submit the S-8 filing.   Below is the timeline from the 
USPTO: 


 
 
Despite the fact that the final rejection had been issued and never disclosed to the public, on 
June 5, 2018 PolarityTE issued 2.1M shares priced at $25.50 where Cantor Fitzgerald acted as 
sole book running manager for the offering.  
 
Cantor should be sanctioned at their level of due diligence completed on COOL.

In case our readers have any doubt about the character of the promoters behind COOL, we 
point you to the below chart summarizing the long history of the failed companies that they 
have promoted and dumped on the market: 
 


 
 
Are there any doubts about how COOL's story ends? 
 
How Is This Not Stock Fraud? 
 
As questionable as people might think the promoters are behind COOL, we believe 
management is more to blame.  Dr Lough is extremely familiar with the patent process and 
Citron believes he has orchestrated this whole scheme to enrich himself.   As described in his 
bio: 
 
“Dr. Lough is experienced with IP and patent evolution, investment strategy, regulatory 
pathway systems, CLIA/ GLP manufacturing platforms, legal due diligence and business 
development.” 
https://www.polarityte.com/about/management-team 
 
In both cases when he received notice of a rejection, Dr. Lough did not miss the opportunity 
to raise money/sell stock and not disclose the most material development. 
 
The Only Thing That Matters!!! 
 



https://www.polarityte.com/about/management-team
Published June 25th, 2018 


From the moment PolarityTE acquired “the patent” to now COOL has submitted over thirty 8-
k filings to the SEC regarding everything from presenting at a conference to filing for a 
trademark…..yet not one of them ever disclosed the only thing that matters:  
 
They have been rejected for patent status for their technology.   
 
Who cares if the science works if you do not own it and are not generating any sales from it? 
 
The continued omission of the only relevant fact regarding the company and its "technology" 
combined with the sales of securities by insiders is not only securities fraud, but we believe 
constitutes criminal and not just civil fraud. 
 
The SEC Is Not Far Behind 
 
Recently, an article appeared in Forbes that seemed nothing short of stock promotion that 
compared Polairty to the next Amazon or Tesla: 
 
https://www.forbes.com/sites/innovatorsdna/2017/08/08/polarityte-will-this-biotech-be-
the-next-amazon-or-tesla/#3c340a95363a 
 
PolarityTE board member Jeff Dyer wrote the article and the SEC has contacted the company 
about the article and the dissemination of this information during a quiet period (e.g. "gun 
jumping").   
 
https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1076682/000149315217009535/filename1.htm 
 
It should not surprise you that Jeff Dyer has filed to sell 93% of his holdings in the S-8 
 
Conclusion 
 
In 2018, it is rare that Citron is able to identify such a blatant fraud by simple use of 
government databases.  The SEC should halt this stock before any of the insiders/promoters 
are able to sell stock to investors who have been deceived by a well-educated yet sleazy 
management team. 
 
Cautious Investing To All 
 
* As an aside for a matter of reference, even the highly controversial and fraudulent MiMedx, 
has 69 patents granted.  Compared to 0 for PolarityTE
