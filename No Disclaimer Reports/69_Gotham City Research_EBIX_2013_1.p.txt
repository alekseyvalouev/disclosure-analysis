between Ebix Singapore and an unnamed related party. 


• Australian revenues are only 32% of the amounts stated in 


the SEC filings, according to Australian filings. 


• 2010 Singapore intangible assets are misstated by $67 


million. 2011 long-lived assets do not add up.  


• The 2010 & 2011 10K filings were filed before the 


Singapore 2010 financial statements were signed off. 


• The Confirmnet acquisition cost 30% more according to 


the India filings than it did according to the SEC filings.

cash from India, unless the cash never left the US. 


• Less than 5% of Singapore’s intangible assets are IP-


related, i.e. most of the assets lack economic substance. 


• EZ-Data’s IP was transferred to Singapore yet Raina says 


“No US IP has been transferred to any other country.” 


• Ebix’s Singapore and India subsidiaries’ financial 


statements for 2011 remain unavailable. 


• Core business is declining, tax rate is rising, and goodwill 


write-offs and debt maturities are looming. 


• The Robin Raina Foundation’s IRS filings are full of material 


accounting irregularities.  


• Raina misrepresented his foundation’s spending by 300+%. 


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS 


• Ebix will restate historical results – likely significantly – as a 


result of the issues covered in this report & elsewhere. 


• Ebix stock should be halted until the financial statements 


are reliable, accurate, and complete. 


• Cherry Bekaert Holland should not sign off on Ebix’s 2012 


financials, without Ebix Singapore’s 2011 and 2012 filings.  


• Ebix’s stated tax strategy is supported by sham in fact 


and/or sham in substance transactions. 


• Ebix shares are worth no more than $5.00/share, & 


approach $0.00 as the IRS, debt, & other risks unfold.

INTRODUCTION 


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH first heard about Ebix last October, when we saw an Ebix-related lawsuit hit 


our inboxes. These kinds of lawsuits are normally thrown out in federal court, but this one did not get 


thrown out.  Our interest in the Ebix story increased as we read through the complaint.  


Given the alarming accusations in the lawsuit, we soon decided to investigate for ourselves, and take a 


fresh look into the company. We read over 10,000 pages of documents from Sweden, Singapore, India, 


Australia, New Zealand, & the United States pertaining to the company. We consulted with professionals 


from the disciplines of forensic accounting, law, transfer pricing, background investigations, finance, and 


software. We found assets not adding, cash disappearing, and management misrepresenting. The more 


we looked, the more we found reality to be far worse than the prior critics had made it out to be.  


For example, we discovered a $66 million undisclosed related party loan
1
, $67 million accounting 


irregularity in long-lived assets
2
, and Australian revenues at a fraction of what the SEC filings disclosed, 


per the Australian filings
3
. We concluded that (i) Ebix’s financial statements are unreliable, inaccurate, 


and incomplete, (ii) their tax strategy is a sham, and (iii) the stock should be halted. 


We decided it was important to go public with our findings after we found out that Robin Raina’s 


misrepresentations did not end with Ebix. For starters, he recently exaggerated to the South Asia Times 


(who named him man of the year) how much Robin Raina Foundation (“RRF”) typically gives every year
4
: 


South Asia Times: How much you give to the foundation? What is its annual outlay? 


Robin Raina: I hate to talk about it. But yes, a majority of the money that comes in for the 


foundation comes from me. In a given year, RRF will typically spend about $2 million. 


In fact, RRF has spent at most $3.7 million combined since inception, as the IRS Form 990s reveal
5
:  





Raina’s bogus claims to the South Asia Times are morally reprehensible, but not illegal. We do wonder, 


though, about his declarations that RRF’s form 990s are “true, correct, and complete”, made under 


penalties of perjury.
6 


As it turns out, there are, in fact, accounting irregularities found in the Robin 


Raina Foundation’s form 990s, as we discuss later in this report.  


As Autonomy, Lernout & Hauspie, AremisSoft, Network Associates, and other epic software frauds 


remind us: when you put together a bunch of bushes, you don’t get a tree – you get a bunch of scraggly, 


old bushes. We believe Ebix is no different, having grown largely due to its improper tax strategy, luck, 


dodgy acquisitions, and Raina’s ability to fool some of the people, all of the time. We believe that the 


chickens are about to come home to roost for Ebix and Raina.

Ebix’s Accounting: Unreliable, Inaccurate, and Incomplete 


What Ebix and CEO Robin Raina Have Said Regarding the Integrity of the Company and its Filings 


On April 1
st


, 2011 (April Fool’s Day), a week after a negative report was published on Seeking Alpha
1
, 


CEO Robin Raina hosted an Investor Conference. The below slide is from said conference
2
: 








On November 5
th


, 2012, a Bloomberg story titled Ebix Accounting Practices Said to Be Probed by SEC
3
 


claimed that Ebix “is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its 


accounting practices, four people with direct knowledge of the probe said.” 


Ebix swiftly issued a press release
4
, in which Robin Raina, Chairman, CEO and President of Ebix, said:  


 “We stand behind the accuracy of our public filings.“ 


Is Robin Raina, Chairman, CEO and President of Ebix telling the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing 


But the Truth?
Page 7 of 46 





Gotham City Research Believes Ebix’s Financial Statements are Unreliable, Inaccurate, & Incomplete 


We believe Ebix’s financial statements are unreliable, inaccurate, and incomplete and that the company 


will have to restate historical results for the following reasons: 


I. Undisclosed Related Party Transactions and Assets That Don’t Add 


• There is a $66 million undisclosed related party loan between Ebix Singapore and an unnamed 


related company. 


• Ebix’s 2010 long-lived assets don’t add up. The Singapore irregularity alone is $67 million. That’s 


equal to 94% of Ebix’s 2011 GAAP net income and just under 10% of the company’s market cap. 


• 2011 long-lived assets on the balance sheet do not add up to the long-lived assets in note 16. 


• The total cost of Confirmnet is off by 30+% between the Indian filings and SEC filings. 


II. Evidence that Reported Revenues and Accounts Receivable are Not Accurate or Reliable 


• Ebix’s Australia revenues, as disclosed in ASIC filings, are only a fraction of what SEC filings show. 


• 20%-40% of accounts receivable seem of dubious quality, given the growth in unbilled 


receivables and odd inclusion of deferred revenue within accounts receivable.  


• Ex-employees have raised doubts on the accuracy and reliability of Ebix’s account receivables. 


III. Other Critics have Voiced an Entirely Different set of Concerns about Ebix’s Reported Figures: 


• Organic growth misrepresentation
5
 – Ebix's most recent 10Q (Q3'12) implies they 


misrepresented organic growth in the 10Q's filed for Q1'12 and Q2'12, and organic growth has 


gone negative. Past organic growth (prior to 2012) rates are suspect, likely misrepresented as 


well – Raina says that 11 percentage points of last year's revenue growth were organic. 


• Weak, non-existent, & inadequate internal controls – Ebix has had 4 auditors in the last 8 years, 


and “As Ebix has gotten larger, its audit firms have gotten smaller.”
6
   





While the concerns we’ve identified are the most serious to date, the combination of what we’ve 


uncovered and what’s already out there leave us with no doubt that Ebix’s financial statements are not 


accurate, reliable, or complete.  


Once revenues are suspect, everything else in the income statement is suspect, as every line-item flows 


through the P&L. Small changes in reported revenue have an amplified effect on EPS (the exact 


multiplier depending on financial and operating leverage).  


And once a company is not disclosing a material related party loan (in an amount roughly equal to Ebix’s 


2009 and 2010 tangible assets), who knows what else they’re hiding?
Page 8 of 46 





The $65.8 Million Undisclosed Related Party Loan between Ebix Singapore and a Related Party 


One of the biggest concerns that some market participants have voiced is that they just can’t seem to 


get around trusting Ebix. Others, such as Jeff Van Rhee of Craig Hallum, seem to trust (without verifying) 


Robin Raina’s claims and Ebix’s financial statements.
7 


We believe that it is actually much worse than even the skeptics think: for starters, the company has 


never disclosed a $65.8 million loan between its Singapore subsidiary and an undisclosed related party. 


From the Singapore filings
8
:  





The loan to Singapore is outstanding as of the 2010 financial statements. We don’t know of its status 


beyond 2010 as Ebix has yet to even file its 2011 filings
9
, as of the writing of this report. Both the 2009 


and 2010 filings indicate that the loan “is not expected to be repaid within the next 12 months”: 





It would seem that the loan is, by definition, a loan of indefinite duration. A loan with such lax terms 


does not seem remotely consistent with an arm’s length transaction (more on this later).  


The Singapore financial statements make it very clear that Ebix Singapore purchased intangible assets 


with the proceeds from said loan, as shown in the statement of cash flows:
Page 9 of 46 





Strangely, Ebix’s Australian filings Do Not Reflect any Corresponding Inflow or Outflow of Cash 


The following footnote reveals that most of the intangible assets were purchased from Telstra 


(subsidiary of Ebix Australia): 





So where did the money flow? The Singapore filings imply it flowed to Australia. The Australian filings, 


then, should reflect the sale of intangible assets to Singapore
10


:
Page 10 of 46 





The ‘Investments’ account clearly reflects a major decline (of just under 50 million aussie dollars). That 


looks about right, and appears to correspond to the sale of intangible assets to Singapore. 


Where things get very strange: there is no corresponding increase in cash on the balance sheet; equally 


disturbing is that the decline in the ‘investments’ account is not reflected at all in the statement of cash 


flows: 





The liabilities section of the balance sheet shows an account with a similar decline in the same period:
Page 11 of 46 





Specifically, there is a decline in ‘Trade and Other Payables’ in an amount that seems on the same order 


of magnitude as the decline in investments account. The specific sub line-item is called ‘amounts 


payable to related parties’. Mathematically, the decline in the investment account mirrors the decline in 


amounts payable to related entities. They appear to cancel each other out to balance the balance sheet. 


Here’s the problem: neither the decline in the investments account (as mentioned), nor the decline in 


payables is found in the statement of cash flows. Nor is there a footnote that explains these declines. 


Gotham City Research believes in three possible explanations (and none of them bode well for Ebix): 


1. The undisclosed related party loan and (corresponding IP purchase transactions) are “sham in 


fact” transactions, i.e. they never actually occurred; 


2. Ebix Singapore did receive said loan from an undisclosed related party, but the money is 


unaccounted for; 


3. Ebix Singapore did receive said loan from an undisclosed related party, and sent proceeds off to 


some completely unmentioned entity, let’s call party X, who then forgave the Ebix Australia’s 


payables. 


In either 3 scenarios, the simple question is “why”? We can’t think of any good reasons, but we can 


think of plenty bad reasons.  


The best case scenario we can think of is scenario number 3. But in that case, the (I) absence of any 


disclosures to US investors, (II) lack of any disclosures regarding this hypothetical ‘party X’ in the 


Singapore filings, and (III) no inflow of cash or explanation in the footnotes of Australian filings lead us to 


believe that these lies of omission were motivated by some (economically) rational reason: namely, to 


improperly minimize taxes. For more, see the tax section. 


Ebix’s Australian Revenues and Profits are only a Fraction of What SEC filings Show, per ASIC filings 


We examined the financial statements of Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd, made available by the Australian 


Securities and Investment Commission (“ASIC”) & found that Ebix’s revenues & pre-tax profits, according 


to the ASIC filings, are only a tiny fraction of what’s stated in Ebix’s SEC 10Ks
11


: 





SEC vs. ASIC FILINGS - 2011 Financial Statements


thousands $ SEC ASIC VARIANCE


Cash $7,605 $8,467 -10.2%


Long-lived assets $1,286 $1,040 23.7%


Revenue $31,991 $10,161 214.8%


pre-tax income $2,734 $1,127 142.6%


Notes:


Cash for Australia from the SEC filings is as of 


3/12/2012, not 12/31/2012, for unknown reasons.


I assume for simplifying purposes 1 Aussie dollar


equals 1 US dollar. US AUD in fact did vary around


1:1 in 2011, so it's a reasonable assumption.
Page 12 of 46 





The revenue and pre-tax income irregularities are particularly odd given that the long-lived assets, cash 


balances, and employee count look far more similar, between the SEC and ASIC filings. 


For example the 2011 Australian filing claims 74 employees (they mysteriously did not fill out and reveal 


employee count in the 2010 ASIC filing), while the 10K 2010 claims 77 employees (Ebix stopped 


reporting employees by geographic segment in 2011 10K).
12





Also, while Ebix does disclose having 3 total subsidiaries in Australia, Ebix Australia Pty,. Ltd., Ebix 


Australia (VIC) Pty. Ltd., and Ebix Exchange-Australia PTY LTD, Ebix Australia (VIC) Pty Ltd’s financial 


statements clearly show that it fully owns Ebix Australia Pty,. Ltd. and Ebix Exchange-Australia PTY LTD: 





Recall, Australia is the only country where Ebix has any significant revenues outside of the US: 





Ex-employee Statements and the Composition + Quality of Accounts Receivables Cast Doubt on the 


Reliability and Accuracy of Ebix’s Reported Revenues 


Ex-employees have questioned the reliability and accuracy of Ebix’s receivables
13


:  


• “Unable to determine which customers had made payment for which projects.”‖ 


• “A former Ebix account manager, who had worked for E-Z Data prior to the acquisition 


and continued to work for Ebix until early 2011, confirmed declining growth.” 


• “As of last quarter, our accounts receivable area became a major concern to senior 


management and to our stockholders.” 


• “A former senior executive of Connective Technologies, Inc., confirmed not only the 


experience of Peak with respect to Ebix‘s inability to provide accurate financials on 


which to base his earn out…” 


• "Constant errors" in "billing and administrative processes" left Ebix's employees "unable 


to properly produce invoices to customers in a timely manner."  


• "Ebix's accounting procedures were plagued by errors. Ebix was consistently unable to 


properly bill customers, tie customer payments to invoices issued by Ebix…provide basic 


financial data, or calculate Peak's revenue."
Page 13 of 46 





• "As a result of the significant billing problems caused by Ebix, Peak did not properly 


allocate sales and revenue into the appropriate accounting periods. As a result, upon 


information and belief Peak overstated its accounts receivable." 


• "Ebix was consistently unable to tie customer payments to specific invoices. As a result 


of Ebix's failure to account for customer payments, Ebix was unable to manage accounts 


receivable for Peak, & Ebix is unable to create & maintain accurate books and records." 


20%-40% of Accounts Receivables Seem of Dubious Quality, per Close Examination of the SEC filings 


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH believes at least 20-40% accounts receivables are of dubious quality. We 


believe Ebix is utilizing a toxic combination of aggressive accounting – rising unbilled receivables, a 


shrinking reserve for doubtful accounts, and unusual inclusion of deferred revenue within receivables. 


Unbilled Receivables  


Unbilled receivables have been used as a classic financial shenanigan to aggressively recognize revenue, 


especially when its growth has outpaced overall A/R growth and revenue growth
14


. Ironically (or 


perhaps not), Ebix’s auditor authored a white paper on unearned receivables
15


. The below table shows 


how unbilled receivables growth outpaced total receivables growth recently
16


:
 





Despite all the issues that employees have identified regarding Ebix’s receivables, allowance for doubt 


accounts has actually been trending down, as a percentage of receivables, even as unbilled receivables 


as a percentage of receivables has been rising. 





Deferred Revenue as a Component of Accounts Receivable

separate deferred revenue account as a liability) as soon as Cherry Bekaert Holland became its auditor in

. The amount of deferred revenue Ebix includes within accounts receivable is buried in the notes, 


making it difficult for most investors who don’t read the notes. The below table shows how the deferred 


revenue included within accounts receivable has grown at a faster clip than accounts receivable: 





The inclusion of deferred revenue within the accounts receivable account is exceedingly rare, based on 


our experience.  


Rather than relying on our judgment, however, we consulted a few accounting experts, who have been 


studying these issues for decades. We asked Dr. Edward Ketz, Professor of Accounting at Penn State 


University, and author of Hidden Financial Risk and Accounting Ethics: “Have you ever seen a company 


include a portion of their deferred revenue in accounts receivable?”  


He said
18


: 


“Never.  Deferred revenue means you have received cash but have not provided the product or 


the service to the customer, so you recognize the liability—the fact that you owe them a product 


or a service.  


If you have a receivable instead, I think this falls into the category of executory contracts.  The 


customer is promising to pay you and you are promising them something in exchange.  The 


profession has a bias against recognizing such mutual promises, as the profession seems not to 


recognize most executory contracts.” 


According to another accounting expert we spoke with, he stated that it is exceedingly rare and unusual 


for a company to include deferred revenue in A/R. He added that it does occur in cases where a 


company nets it out of accounts receivable. However, the same accounting expert said he’s never seen 


deferred revenue included within accounts receivable in the event there is a separate deferred revenue 


account (which Ebix has). 


Based on our independent research, the evidence seems to support Professor Ketz and the other expert 


we spoke to: we found less than 5 cases where deferred revenue is included within accounts receivable; 


in most of the cases, it was netted out due to an absence of a deferred revenue account.  





Deferred Revenue Included Within A/R Has Grown Faster than Total A/R

Ebix’s 2010 Long-Lived Assets Don’t Add Up. The Singapore Irregularity Alone is $67 Million (94% of 


GAAP 2011 Net Income and Just Under 10% of the Market Cap)  


Contrary to Mr. Raina’s claims suggesting that all Ebix’s public filings are accurate, we subsequently 


found material irregularities in the reporting of 2010’s long-lived assets. The irregularity in the Singapore 


long-lived assets alone is $67 million, which is roughly equal to Ebix’s entire 2011 GAAP earnings. The 


table below shows the irregularities, that is the 2010's long-lived assets as reported in the 2010 10K vs 


2011 10K
19


: 





We highly doubt that these accounting irregularities were made by accident; Ebix has had plenty of time, 


and has filed 5 amended 10Ks just in the last 2 years. In fact, none of the amended 10Ks correct these 


irregularities, nor has there been an amended filing been released for 2010’s 10K. If they wanted to get 


this right, we believe they would’ve done so by now, especially given all the extra public scrutiny the 


company has received in the last 2 years.  


Three Different Numbers for the 2010 Singapore Long-Lived Assets 


A superficial examination of the 2011 10K would lead many to believe that Ebix and/or Cherry Bekaert 


Holland corrected the 2010 long-lived asset numbers in the 2011 10K. We believe the 2010 long-lived 


assets numbers from both the 2010 and 2011 10Ks remain unreliable and inaccurate, for the simple 


reason that the 2010 Singapore long-lived assets number does not agree with the figures provided in the 


2010 and 2011 10Ks
20

TOTAL $233,728 $242,518 $8,790


Note 1: EBIX previously reported "goodwill and intangible assets" in note 16


by geographic segment in the 2010 10K. In the 2011 10K , EBIX reported  


"long-lived assets" in lieu of "goodwill and intangible assets". Despite


the name change, they are substantially equivalent, as there are no


material long-lived assets beyond goodwill and intangible assets.


Note 2: In the 2010 10K, EBIX reported 'The Americas' whereas in the 2011 10K


started to break out by specific region, i.e. US, Canada, & Latin America.
Page 16 of 46 








No matter which exchange rates you use to convert from USD to SGD and visa versa (within the range 


that the SGD USD actually traded in 2010), the 2010 Singapore long-lived assets number reported in the 


2011 10K does not equal that found in the Singapore 2010 filings. 


We believe these irregularities point to a much more serious problem: Ebix’s reported financials are 


unreliable and inaccurate. If the goodwill and intangible assets are materially unreliable, then Ebix’s 


profits by segment are materially unreliable, as they directly impact amortization expense, which 


materially and directly impact segment profits.   


If the Singapore intangible Asset Numbers are Suspect, so is the Alleged Singapore Tax Scheme 


The company claims
21


: 


The Company also has a relatively low income tax rate is in Singapore in which our operations 


are taxed at a 10% marginal tax rate as a result of concessions granted by the local Singapore 


Economic Development Board for the benefit of in-country intellectual property owners. 


The irregularities shown above cast a shadow over Ebix’s stated tax strategy in Singapore. After all, if 


there are three different numbers for the 2010 Singapore long-lived assets (and most of the long-lived 


assets are intangible assets), is not the stated tax strategy suspect as well?  The basis of said tax scheme 


is intellectual property (which is included in the intangible assets), according to Ebix. 


As we discuss in greater depth, it turns out this is only the tip of the iceberg, as there are bigger 


problems with Ebix’s claimed tax strategy. 





2011 Long-lived Assets on the Balance Sheet Show One Number, while Note 16 Shows Another 


After uncovering the 2010 long-lived asset irregularities discussed, we then looked to verify and cross 


check the long-lived asset figures disclosed in note 16 (of the 2010 and 2011 10Ks) to the long-lived 


asset figures that could be derived from the consolidated balance sheet. 


The 2010 Singapore Long-Lived Assets from 3 Sources


2010 10K 2011 10K
Singapore 


Filing


In US Dollars $134,993 $67,781 $77,407


In Singapore Dollars $173,379 $87,055 $99,418


The Singapore Dollar (SGD) to US Dollar on 12/31/2010


 = 0.7786. The low for the SGD USD in 2010  was 0.7028, 


which means currency does not explain the variance 


between the 2010 long-lived asset # from the 2011 10K 


and the 2010 Singapore financial statements.
Page 17 of 46 





We found that 2011’s long-lived assets as calculated from the consolidated balance sheet do not equal 


the total long-lived assets number found in note 16. The 2010 numbers add up; 2011’s do not as shown 


below
22


: 





No matter how we calculate long-lived assets, either (I) subtracting current assets from total assets or (II) 


adding up the long-lived assets one by one, neither calculation equals long-lived assets found in note 16. 


In our experience studying and uncovering some of the great accounting-related frauds in the last 20 


years, one common characteristic many have shared: basic, straight-forward numbers that should add 


up, don’t. Even if these specific discrepancies are small in isolation, they are indicative of much bigger 


problems. 


How much did Ebix pay for Confirmnet (including earnouts)? The Ebix India filings Say One Thing, the 


SEC Filings Another 


Ebix’s Indian subsidiary’s filings and SEC filings tell the same story as far as how much was paid for 


Confirmnet (including earnouts) in 2008 and 2009. In 2010, however, they do not. They differ by at least 


$5 million, as shown in the below table
23


: 





Gotham City Research is not sure which numbers are correct. Either the 10Ks are correct, the India 


filings are correct, or neither are correct. Just like the Singapore long-lived assets, however, the clear 


implication here is that the Ebix financial statements are not reliable, accurate, or complete.

Ebix Taxes: Sham in Fact or Sham in Substance 


What Ebix and CEO Robin Raina Have Said Regarding Alleged Ebix’s Tax Strategies 


Robin Raina says that Ernst & Young International has ensured that Ebix follows India's regulations in its 


transfer payments. "The government has given a pretty good tax rate to us," says Raina. "We are not 


running a tax shelter."
1
  


He has also said “No US IP has been transferred to any other country” as shown below
2
: 








Gotham City Research does not trust the company’s account of its tax strategy. We believe it is a sham 


in fact, if not in substance for the following reasons: 


• The $66 million undisclosed related party loan seems to serve no purpose other than to reduce 


taxes; the loan seems to violate the arms-length principle, in nearly every way possible. 


• The purchase/transfer of IP assets from Australia/US to Singapore financed with the proceeds 


from the undisclosed loan doesn’t seem to serve any economic role other than tax minimization. 


• Intellectual property is a very small percentage of Singapore’s intangible assets. Nearly 90% of 


the intangible assets purchased were Goodwill and Contractual/Territorial Relationships.
Page 19 of 46 





Ebix’s flow of cash, profits, composition of assets, and certain operational details don’t agree with 


Ebix’s explanations of its tax strategies. 


• Singapore’s balance sheet contained no intangible assets prior to 2009, which is not supportive 


of Raina’s claims that Singapore had IP structures in place “many years back” 


• Singapore’s director wears way too many hats, some which seem of a conflicting nature.  


• Ebix India’s cash declined by $11 million between 5/7/2012 and 8/7/2012, with no explanation.  


• Confirmnet acquisition was financed by an Indian subsidiary, which seems a taxable event. 


• We estimate Ebix must have repatriated cash from India to the US to pay for its Planetsoft 


Acquisition. Or the cash never left the US. 


• Interest income on cash seems low for a company that should be swimming in cash offshore. 


• E-Z Data, wholly owned subsidiary of Ebix, transferred US intellectual property to Ebix Singapore, 


contrary to Raina’s claim “No US IP has been transferred to any other country.” 


We believe Raina and Ebix were motivated by the desire to minimize taxes, fund acquisitions with funds 


that otherwise belong to taxpayers, support the stock via dividends and stock buybacks with funds that 


otherwise belong to taxpayers, and self-enrichment. 


Ebix’s taxes looked suspicious even before we uncovered the above stated facts. Specifically
3
: 


• Ebix had the lowest effective tax rate of its peers in 9 of the last 10 years. 


• Ebix’s tax rates in 2009 and 2010 were 3% and 1% respectively, even as CRM, IBM, AAPL, GOOG, 


and MSFT tax rates were between 21%-41% in the same period.  


• Ebix’s geographic allocation of pre-tax profits over 2008-2011 appears at odds with geographic 


location of its assets and the sourcing of its revenues.  


• Revenue vs. profits vs. PP&E disparity could draw scrutiny from IRS. 


• Uncertain tax reserve seems exceptionally low, at 1.6% of total pretax income (in last 4 years), is 


one of lowest of companies analyzed. IRS has not received years 2007-2011; if unfavorable 


review, may not have sufficient reserve to offset the assessment. 


• Aspects of Ebix's tax provision do not conform to GAAP. Since 2002, Ebix has provisioned $5 


million in GAAP taxes in total, despite being profitable from a GAAP perspective each quarter.

The Singapore Undisclosed Related Party Loan and the Arm’s Length Principle 


The arm’s length principle, despite its informal sounding name, is found in Article 9 of the OECD Model 


Tax Convention and is the framework for bilateral treaties between OECD countries, and many non-


OECD governments, too. Article 9 states
4
: 


[Where] conditions are made or imposed between the two [associated] enterprises in their 


commercial or financial relations which differ from those which would be made between 


independent enterprises, then any profits which would, but for those conditions, have accrued to 


one of the enterprises, but, by reason of those conditions, have not so accrued, may be included 


in the profits of that enterprise and taxed accordingly. 


Said differently, a transfer price should be the same as if the two companies involved were indeed two 


independents, not part of the same corporate structure. 


According to the Singapore Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore (“IRAS”), to determine the arm’s 


length interest rate, some factors to consider include
5
: 


• the nature and purpose of the loan, 


• market conditions at the time the loan was granted, 


• the principal amount, 


• tenure and terms of the loan, etc. 


We believe the undisclosed related party loan between clearly violates the “arm’s length principle” for 


the following reasons: 


1. No independent party would ever have made such a loan of this size, and with such absurd loan 


to value, interest coverage, and other debt ratios. An underwriter would simply reject such a 


loan request. As a result, there would be no loan, and no market clearing interest rate. 


2. No independent party would lend on such lax and fuzzy terms, i.e. an indefinite term loan. 


3. Market conditions in 2009 only add to our beliefs stated in 1. And 2. 


4. The purpose of the loan was to acquire intangible assets; we believe the intangibles assets were 


transferred for little to no reason other than to avoid US and Australian taxes. 


No Independent Party Would Approve the Singapore Loan  


This loan not only lacks precedent transactions, but its absurdly uneconomic nature is not consistent 


with an “arms length” transaction: The interest coverage and loan to asset ratios are quite comical

Page 21 of 46 





No independent Party Would Lend to Ebix Singapore PTE LTD on Such Lax and Ambiguous Terms 


Ebix Singapore PTE LTD’s 2009 & 2010 filings provide little information regarding the terms of the loan: 





We deduce that “is not expected to be repaid with the next twelve months” indicates that the loan has 


no clear maturity date, as the 2009 and 2010 contain the same language. That is, this is a loan of 


indefinite duration. Based on precedent transactions and underwriting standards, the terms are not 


consistent with an arms-length transaction. 


A Closer look at the Singapore Operations 





Raina claims, “Our world-wide development and IP structure was established in these places many years 


back as a globalization need.”
7 


The facts with respect to Singapore suggest otherwise, as Singapore had no intellectual property on its 


balance sheet in 2008
8
:
Page 22 of 46 





Singapore only had 6-11 employees prior to its purchase of intangible assets from Australia/US
9
: 





Ebix Singapore’s Director, John Graham Prior, seems to wear way too many hats, as he is
10


: 


• Ebix Singapore’s 1 of 2 Directors (who signed off on the last two financial statements) 


• Corporate Senior Vice President of International Business and Intellectual Property  


• Primary point of contact for all inquiries 


• And primary sales contact 











Legitimate businesses separate the sales function from the accounting/audit function. But in the case of 


Ebix, the same person who signs off on the audited financial statements is also the primary sales contact, 


and the primary contact for general inquiries. That seems improper, and indicative of negligible 


infrastructure. 


So in short, the facts don’t support Robin Raina’s claim that, “Our world-wide development and IP 


structure was established in these places many years back as a globalization need.”
11 


In fact, all the above mentioned facts suggest Ebix only modified Singapore’s organizational structure in 


order to reap the rewards of the favorable tax structure (contrary to Raina’s claim otherwise). 


Over 95% of Singapore’s Intangible Assets Have Nothing to Do with Intellectual Property  


Robin Raina would have you believe that Ebix is swimming in intellectual property, and that Singapore is 


some mecca of intellectual property. So let’s look at what the numbers say
12


: 


Employee Count


2008 2009 2010


Americas 308 412 533


Australia 63 66 77


Zealand 9 9 12


India 251 460 530


Singapore 6 11 27


Total 637 958 1179
Page 23 of 46 








As more clearly shown below, most of Ebix’s intangible assets are unrelated to IP assets: 





We will go a step further: goodwill and contractual/territorial relationship are largely worthless, if they 


were marked to market, as Ebix is a roll-up, with declining organic growth.  It seems that Ebix Singapore 


bought ‘goodwill’ and ‘contractual/territorial relationships’ from Australia (possibly the US), for reasons 


we cannot fathom. 


The only reason we can come up with are : (1) Ebix wanted to give off the appearance that it owns a 


large amount of IP (hoping no one would look at the footnotes, and discover the truth) (2) and fool the 


Singapore government into approving a low tax rate. 


We don’t see how the paper ownership of paper assets that have little value beyond the paper it’s 


written on, somehow magically enables Ebix to avoid US taxes. Recall that we have three different 


numbers for 2010’s Singapore intangible assets, as we discussed earlier. All in all, it all seems way too 


good to be true. Our belief is that these funny looking transactions serve little to no purpose other than 


to minimize taxes for Ebix, inc. 


Ebix India’s Cash Declined by $11 Million Between 5/7/2012 and 8/7/2012, With No Explanation 


One of the tell-tale signs of transfer pricing schemes run by some of the more well known companies – 


such as Apple, Google, etc. – is that foreign profits in favorable tax regimes remain offshore, not just on 


paper. The precise reason transfer pricing has gotten so much attention is that in the event these funds 


are repatriated back onshore, these companies have to pay taxes on them (follow the recent Dell 


headlines, for example)

So how is it that Ebix can use or move $11 million of cash (cash by geographic segment shown below) 


from India with no explanation, between May 7, 2012 and August 7, 2012?
14








It would seem that the $11 million was either used in India or used elsewhere. It does not appear to 


have been transferred over to another region, as 8/7/2012 total cash shows a meaningful decline.  


The $11 Million Not Used Within India 


India’s long-lived assets actually declined in India between 3/30/2012 and 9/30/2012 (long-lived assets

If Ebix used the $11 million from India to finance any of the above transactions, we wonder if it paid any 


taxes related to the necessary repatriation of those funds. 


It is Unclear How Ebix Financed its Planetsoft Acquisition Without Repatriating Cash from India 


Most of Ebix’s revenue is generated in the US and Australia; the cash somehow makes its way to 


Singapore and India. That’s fine, but if the funds then return to the US or other regions to finance 


acquisitions, without any payment of taxes … we wonder if it’s too good to be true.  


You can keep the cash onshore, and pay a higher tax rate, or you can move the cash offshore, and keep 


it there; you can’t have it both ways (the only way one might be able to have it both ways is via some 


special financing facility. However, Ebix has never mentioned or disclosed in its filings; furthermore, 


Ebix’s balance sheet doesn’t seem able to support such an arrangement). 


Planetsoft’s total cost is $40 million, of which $34-35 million was paid in cash. Ebix funded “using a mix 


of internal cash reserves and the Bank credit line available to Ebix.”
17 


The problem with this explanation is it would imply that Ebix’s US cash balance would have gone 


negative to finance this transaction, even with their credit line fully maxed out according to our 


calculations
18


: 





Note that the calculations shown don’t factor in the following (source of funds would decline):  


• Not all revenues are derived from US, which means not all cash flow is US based. 


• Planetsoft seems to have closed before 6/30, which means Ebix did not have the full period’s 


cash flow to pay for it. 


A more plausible explanation is that Ebix used monies from India (without paying taxes). It would make 


more sense from a business perspective, as most businesses maintain a certain minimum level of 


operating cash to support operations. The other possibility is that the funds never left the US. 


As discussed in the prior section, Ebix’s cash disclosures by country shows India is the only region 


where Ebix’s cash actually declined in relevant period. 


SOURCES OF CASH COMMENTS


Debt $31,000 Net addition to debt.


CFFO $21,000 CFFO is for full period, acquisition closed earlier.


Cash $8,000 US cash estimate, avg. between 5/7 and 8/7


TOTAL $60,000


USES OF CASH OTHER COMMENTS:


Buyback $9,400 The uses of cash exceed sources of cash.


Other acquisitions + capex $15,000 India is only country where cash declines from 5/7 to 8/7.


Planetsoft $34,000


Dividend $3,300


TOTAL $61,700
Page 26 of 46 





Ebix’s Yield on its Cash is Low, Given it Should be Swimming in Interest Earning Assets Offshore 


With much higher prevailing interest rates in India, Australia, and Latin America, we struggle to 


understand why Ebix has only yielded 1.7%-2.2% on its cash
19


: 





We believe this means that the cash never really leaves the US (& is instead used to make acquisitions), 


it leaves only when it has to (for tax compliance purposes), or the cash moves around frequently.  


The Undisclosed Related Party Loan in Singapore Further Shields Taxable Income 


Based on our calculations, the undisclosed related party loan reduces Singapore taxable income by 


around $7,000,000 (Singapore dollars) annually
20


, so long as the loan (of indefinite duration) remains 


outstanding. This is in addition to the tens of millions of dollars in taxes the loans helped save, via the 


purchase of intangible assets. We think the indefinite duration of the loan serves no purpose other than 


to shield taxes indefinitely. 





Also note how the interest expense from this loan exceeds the net interest expense of Ebix, inc. by 


around 5x: 





Interest Income


thousands $ 2010 2011


Cash + ST investments $29,690 $25,100


Interest income $519 $557


GCR estimate $1,191 $1,007


 Reported yield 1.7% 2.2%
Page 27 of 46 





Ebix Software India Private Ltd paid for ConfirmNet, Apparently without Paying Taxes 


Ebix appears to have paid 100% cash for Confirmnet, through its Ebix Software India Private Ltd 


subsidiary.
21


 We’re not aware of any taxes Ebix paid for this transaction, even though an Indian entity 


paid for a US entity, suggesting funds flowed from India to the US (what appears to be a repatriation 


event). If Dell has to pay taxes on funds it returns to the US from various offshore locations, shouldn’t 


Ebix? 


Recall that it is not clear how much exactly Ebix paid for Confirmnet in the first place, as the India filings 


say one thing, and the SEC filings another (as discussed earlier in this report). 





Ebix Singapore PTE LTD Purchased Intellectual Property, Apparently without Paying Any Taxes 


It would seem that Ebix Singapore PTE LTD’s purchase of E-Z Data’s intellectual property resembles Ebix 


India’s purchase of Confirm-Net, i.e. both subsidiaries used foreign funds (that was originally earned 


onshore) to finance US acquisitions, apparently without any tax consequences. 


Raina claimed in a 2011 investor day (a week immediately after Copperfield Research publicized their 


first report on Ebix): "No US IP has been transferred to any other country".
22





The Singapore filings and SEC filings suggest otherwise (see the ‘transfer of intangible assets’ line item; 


we’re certain the E-Z Data transaction is contained with the $76 million)

Ebix’s Stock Deserves to be Halted  


On November 5
th


, 2012, a Bloomberg story claimed that:
1 


“Ebix is being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for its accounting 


practices, four people with direct knowledge of the probe said.” 


Ebix swiftly issued a press release, in which Robin Raina, Chairman, CEO and President of Ebix, said
2
:  


“The Ebix senior management team has not been advised of nor is it aware of an any SEC 


investigation regarding the Company’s previous filings”. 


Whatever the case, investors should seriously doubt the accuracy, reliability, completeness of Ebix’s 


financial statements, disclosures, and past remarks. We doubt CBH obtained reasonable assurance that 


Ebix’s financial statements & schedules were free of misstatement, contrary to their claims otherwise.  


We believe that Ebix’s stock should be halted, until its financial statements are reliable, accurate, and 


complete. We also believe the current auditor has to go, as they’re not doing their job. 


The following serve as the bases of our opinions: 


• Ebix never filed its Singapore subsidiary’s 2011 financial statements with the Accounting and 


Corporate Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“ACRA”), likely as a result of heightened scrutiny. 


• Ebix never filed its India subsidiaries’ 2011 financial statements with India’s Ministry of 


Corporate Affairs, likely for the same reasons it did not file with Singapore regulators.   


• Ebix Singapore’s 2010 and 2009 financial statements were signed off well over a year after each 


respective year’s fiscal year end, even though filings prior to 2009 were all filed within a year. 


• Ebix filed the 2010 and 2011 10Ks without Singapore’s 2010 audited financial statements signed 


off (Ebix Singapore’s 2010 financial statements were signed off on March 20, 2012).  


• Unclear how CBH obtained reasonable assurance that Ebix’s financial statements & schedules 


were free of misstatement, without the audited Singapore financial statements. 


• Robin Raina claims Ebix parted ways with KPMG, while SEC filings indicate that KPMG resigned. 


• We wonder how “independent“ Cherry Bekaert Holland is, given the cozy relationship that 


exists between CBH, EBIX, STSI (CBH’s 2
nd


 largest publicly traded client), & tennis star John Isner. 


• Ebix added a new Risk Factor –"If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we 


may not be able to accurately determine our financial results or prevent fraud."  


• Ebix has flooded the SEC with amended 10Ks, without correcting the irregularities we pointed to. 


• Captive and impotent Board of Directors & audit committee. None reside in the United States. 


• 58 comment and response letters filed with the SEC, between 2007 and 2012. 


• Ebix, formerly known as Delphi, was a posterchild of bad behavior. It was in the red and 


indulging in revenue recognition practices that got its audit partner banned/censured by the SEC.

The Missing 2011 Singapore Financial Statements  


Given how crucial Singapore is to Ebix’s alleged tax strategy (as detailed earlier in this report), we were 


disappointed to find that Ebix has yet to file its 2011 filings with the Accounting and Corporate 


Regulatory Authority of Singapore (“ACRA”)
3
:
Page 30 of 46 





We also find it funny that Ebix filed for what appears to be a 1-2 month extension in May 2012: 





It’s been over 9 months since Ebix Singapore for an extension, and still no 2011 financial statements. 


The Missing 2011 India Financial Statements; Ebix filed its 2011 10K before Ebix India’s 2011 Filed 


We unsuccessfully tried obtaining the 2011 financial statements for the two India subsidiaries (though 


by 2011, we believe they were to be merged, or “amalgamated” into one entity
4
), using three 


independent India-based contacts, over the last 3 months.  All mentioned that Ebix had technically filed 


some of the forms for 2011, but did not file the financial statements. All three sources stated Ebix did 


not release any useful information for 2011. Note that CBH and Ebix signed off on the 2011 10K before 


the India filings have been released. 


Ebix Singapore PTE LTD Filed its 2010 Financial Statements after Ebix, inc. Filed the 2010 & 2011 10Ks 


Ebix somehow released its 2010 & 2011 10Ks before Ebix Singapore released its 2010 financial 


statements. The table below shows the dates the filings were signed off:

Page 31 of 46 





It’s unclear how Cherry Bekaert Holland signed off on either the 2010 or 2011 10Ks without the audited 


Singapore 2010 filing. It’s also unclear how CBH signed off on the 2011 10K without the 2011 Indian and 


Singapore filings. 


Also note: Ebix Singapore’s 2010 and 2009 financial statements were signed off well over a year after 


each respective year’s fiscal year end. Prior to 2009, however, the Singapore filings were all filed within 


a year’s time. We would like to point out that 2008 is when CBH entered the picture. We wonder if this 


is a mere coincidence, or sign of something more sinister. 


Ebix’s Peculiar New Risk Factor 


Ebix snuck in a peculiar new Risk Factor
6
: 


"If we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately 


determine our financial results or prevent fraud." If we or our independent auditors discover a 


material weakness in our controls over financial reporting, the disclosure of that fact, even if 


immediately remedied, could significantly reduce the market value of our common stock. In 


addition, the existence of any material weakness or significant deficiency would require 


management to devote significant time and incur significant expense to remediate any such 


weaknesses, and management may not be able to remediate same in a timely manner.”  


Captive and Impotent Board of Directors 


None of the members of the board of directors reside in the United States, and none of the audit 


committee members seem fit to do their jobs. It should concern shareholders that this is the public face 


of Ebix’s BOD & audit committee (note that Hans has no demonstrated accounting or finance skills):
Page 32 of 46 





We don’t believe that any of the members of the audit committee are fit to do the job. Two are 


unqualified and one does not have the time nor is in proximity to do the job
7
: 


• Hans U. Benz has no demonstrated accounting background or skills; based in Europe. 


• Hans Ueli Keller has no demonstrated accounting background or skills; based in Europe. 


• Pavan Bhalla, the chairman of the audit committee, is an MBA with no CPA credentials, and 


resides in India. He is currently a managing director of Aon Hewitt’s outsourcing operations. We 


don’t think he has the time, dedicated resources, or proximity to chair the audit committee.  


Ebix has Filed 10 Amended 10Ks In The Last 10 Years, and 7 Before That:  





Robin Raina Claims Ebix Left KPMG, Not the Other Way Around 


 Robin says they went with BDO because BDO gave an offer they couldn’t refuse, they were moving to 


Atlanta (from Illinois), and there was to be a KMPG partner change. His tone and words make it sound 


like it was on the company’s initiative, not KPMG’s
8
:  


 “The fee structure was high. And BDO came in and offered not to exceed 200K. A deal 


for 2 years, across the world… Why don’t we move in to BDO? That was the reason we 


changed from KMPG, there was no negativity.” 


Yet SEC filings clearly show KMPG resigned
9
: 


"KPMG LLP resigned as the independent registered public accounting firm of our Company" 


"(1) delegation of authority and what KPMG considered to be inadequate reviews by a person other 


than the preparer of accounting information, (2) the lack of a formalized contract review process to 


ensure proper revenue recognition, (3) the lack of a complete understanding of the Company’s 


income tax positions and related accounts, (4) inadequate documentation for certain unusual 


transactions (including the basis for the Company’s accounting conclusions), and (5) internal control 


matters (documented and testable control environment) under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act"
10
Page 33 of 46 





Cherry Bekaert Holland’s Opinion on Ebix’s Internal Controls is at Complete Odds with the Opinions of 


Former Employees and Former Auditors   


CBH has claimed
11


: “In our opinion, Ebix, Inc. maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 


control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2011, based on criteria established in Internal Control 


— Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 


Commission (COSO).” CBH has also made similar claims in prior year’s 10K filings. 


The senior billing analyst in the Peak complaint makes claims at complete odds with CBH’s statement.
12 


One of Ebix’s former auditors, BDO Seidman, also "identified certain significant deficiencies relating to 


the Company’s internal control over financial reporting"
13





As mentioned in the prior page, KPMG expressed similar concerns as BDO. 


Then on December 12, 2008, Ebix, Inc. received notice from Habif, Arogeti & Wynne, LLP of its decision 


not to stand for re-appointment as Ebix’s independent registered public accountant.
14


 Ebix would seem 


to be a prized client for Habif, so it seems quite odd to us that it voluntarily left Ebix. 


And in the meantime, Ebix’s business has grown in complexity (i.e. there are more subsidiaries). 


Therefore, past concerns about its internal controls seem more relevant today, than in the past.  


It’s one thing for Ebix to have different auditors for different subsidiaries (which itself is a red flag), but if 


CBH is signing off on Ebix’s 2010 and 2011 financial statements without the Singapore 2010 and 2011 


filings, that seems like a clear violence, in substance, if not form, of CBH’s duty as an auditor. 


The Cherry Bekaert Holland, Ebix, John Isner Connection 


Ebix sponsors John Isner, the #22-ranked tennis player in the world.  His website says plainly that it is 


“powered by EBIX.”
15


 (see upper right hand corner of the image below).  It also mentions that they 


recently signed-on with Star Scientific:
Page 34 of 46 





The name ‘Star Scientific” (“STSI”) stuck out because they are CBH’s 2
nd


 largest publicly traded company 


client, after Ebix.
16 


STSI signed Isner to promote their ant-inflammatory product, even though Star Scientific’s mission is to 


“promote maintenance of a healthy metabolism and to reduce harm associated with the use of tobacco 


at every level.”
17


 Seems like a funny thing for a tennis player to sponsor himself. 





The two operative words for Star Scientific is “stock promotion”. It is in their DNA. The founder and CEO, 


Jonnie Williams is a case in point. Mr. Williams has a long history of stock promotion that led to SEC 


sanctions
18


.  


“On January 7, Chief Judge Joseph L. Tauro, U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, 


entered Orders of Permanent Injunction against Jonnie R. Williams (Williams), a Sarasota, 


Florida stock promoter. 


The Commission's complaint alleged that the defendants were involved in a fraudulent scheme 


to promote Spectra's securities through false publicity in violation of Section 17(a) of the 


Securities Act of 1933 and Section lOeb) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule lOb-5 


thereunder. Williams was also charged with violations of the beneficial ownership provisions by 


his alleged failure to report his sales of Spectra's stock during the course of the publicity 


campaign.” 


Unsurprisingly, there was a recent negative article titled, “Star Scientific's Made-Up, Misleading 


Relationship With Johns Hopkins” by Adam Feuerstein
19


 (he’s the widely followed Senior Columnist at 


TheStreet, who covers biotech/drug stocks)

Is Ebix a good Business? Let’s Look at the Facts 


What Robin Raina is not telling you: 


• Ebix Has Not Generated Lasting Free Cash Flow 


• Raina
2
: "Our cash-generating rate continues to increase. The story of Ebix is a cash 


story." Yet Ebix has actually burned cash during the Reign of Raina: 





• Ebix Has a Poor Balance Sheet – Working Capital less Debt is Very Negative & Declining 





• Tangible Book Value is Very Negative, and Declining 





• Ebix’s Equity is at Risk of Heading to Zero, given Ebix’s Poor Balance Sheet, If: 


1. The US IRS, SEC, and other regulatory agencies reclaim cash that belongs to taxpayers 


2. Outstanding litigations cost Ebix more than expected 


3. The foreign counterparts to the SEC and IRS take action 


4. We estimate the IRS liability alone can easily exceed $100 million

Ebix is Worse than Autonomy; a Would-be Acquirer’s Expected IRR is at Best -80% 


The following factors suggest that the expected return on an Ebix LBO or acquisition is quite poor: 


• The numbers are unreliable, inaccurate, & incomplete – Why buy something without clarity on 


the true economics of the business? Unclear why someone wants to volunteer to be the next 


Hewlett Packard or Caterpillar
3
 (who both recently wrote off nearly their entire investments in 


Autonomy and a Chinese acquisition respectively) 


• The fundamentals, as reported, are poor – Negative organic growth, debt, negative tangible 


book value, and no lasting free cash flow generation, leave no room for error. 


• A true turnaround would require significant increases in R&D and Sales & Marketing spend –  


Ebix does not invest in its own business; R&D and marketing spend would need to rise 


significantly just to play catch-up with comparable businesses. This would eat away at margins 


and also take a lot of time. 


• Why do business with Robin Raina, who makes inaccurate claims about his business & charity? 


• Tax situation could mean game over; going private does not mitigate this risk – a strategic or 


financial buyer would inherit the tax bill, interest, and penalties, that an IRS and others impose. 


• An unusual provision renders going private unappealing –Ebix's board "unanimously approved" 


a change in control provision
4
, whereby Robin Raina is guaranteed a cash payment of 20% of the 


difference between the transaction price and the valuation of the company at $7.95 per share in 


the event of a change in control. 


• Ebix shares are worth no more than 1.0x sales or $5.00/share – Businesses with declining sales 


tend to trade for no more than 1.0x sales (see Hewlett Packard, which trades at 0.25x sales). 


Ebix trades at over 3.0x sales. Couple the decline in the core business with all the event and 


structural risks identified in this report, and Ebix easily trades in lower single digits. 








“So we don't really -- everything that's so entangled in each other, that's so difficult for us to

Robin Raina Tells Investors (and Some Believe Him)
3
: 








“The Company holds its directors, officers and employees to the highest ethical standards in both its 


business operations, and in its efforts to achieve long-term value for its shareholders.” – Ebix March 25, 


2011 press release
4 


Robin Raina Foundation 


Contrary to conventional wisdom, the great fraudsters of our time – Enron, Stanford, Madoff, etc. – all 


surrounded themselves with charity and other walls of false integrity
5
 to fool and distract their victims: 


“White collar criminals build walls of false integrity around them by showcasing their good deeds, 


while living a parallel life of crime.” – Sam Antar, former CFO of Crazy Eddie’s 


Yet lies have a way of eventually catching up with fraudsters. We believe that time is near for Raina.  


• Robin Raina blatantly misrepresented to the South Asia Times about how much his foundation, 


the Robin Raina Foundation (“RRF”), typically gives annually.  


• RRF’s 2004-2010 tax returns contain material financial irregularities & inaccuracies.  


We believe Mr. Raina is worthy of a formal investigation and indictment, given the clear patterns of 


misrepresentation as both CEO of Ebix, and Founder/CEO/CFO of the RRF.
Page 40 of 46 





Robin Raina Misrepresents his Foundation’s Level of Giving/Spending 


We believe that Robin Raina overstated his foundation’s spending by at least 300%.   


South Asia Times: How much you give to the foundation? What is its annual outlay?
6 


Robin Raina: I hate to talk about it. But yes, a majority of the money that comes in for the 


foundation comes from me. In a given year, RRF will typically spend about $2 million. 


In reality, RRF has spent at most $3.7 million combined since 2004 (the year of its inception), as the 


RRF’s form 990s reveal
7
:  





The most RRF ever spent in a single year was $1 million 2010 – half of what he claims they’ve been 


spending in a ‘typical’ year. The foundation spent less than $100,000 in 2011 less than 5% of the typical 


$2 million he claimed, and a decline of over 90% from the prior year. 


What makes things look much worse is that most of ‘total expenses’ consists of funds transferred to the 


Robin Raina Charitable Trust (“RRCT”), Raina’s India-based non-profit. Which raises the question: 


Is Robin Raina Foundation a Charity?
8 





Over 75% of RRF’s total spending consist of (I) non-charitable spending on parties, shows, and other 


administrative expenses and (II) a transfer of funds to RRCT. If Raina will misrepresent his foundation’s 


charitable spending to the South Asia Times, we don’t see what’s to stop him from doing worse. And it 


gets worse.  


The Robin Raina Foundation’s Tax Returns are Full of Material Accounting Irregularities  


We found several different varieties of accounting irregularities, while combing through RRF’s form 990s. 


One variety of discrepancy: RRF’s net assets (i.e., cash) do not add up for 2004-2007’s filings:

We examined the irregularities from different angles, and believe the mistakes are not innocent or 


accidental. At least $250,000-$500,000 is unaccounted for. We also believe Robin Raina is a very 


intelligent and capable man. As a result, it would take extraordinary evidence for us to believe he did 


not sign off on these form 990s without knowing they were false.  


We’ll leave it to readers and regulators to guess where the money is. 


Another accounting irregularity we found is that 2008’s net assets at the end of the year do not 


reconcile with its stated beginning of the year net assets adjusted for revenue less expenses
10


: 





Note that Robin Raina signed, under penalty of perjury, that he examined the returns, and that they are 


true, correct, and complete
11


: 


“Under penalties of perjury, I declare that I have examined this return, including accompanying 


schedules and statements, and to the best of my knowledge and belief, it is true, correct, and 


complete.” – Signed, Robin Raina, for the form 990s 2004 – 2011 


Unlike lying to the South Asia Times about your charitable activities, lying to the government is a serious 


criminal (not civil) offense. We believe there is a strong case for an indictment of, and investigation into 


Robin Raina, given:  


(I) he has a clear, documented history of misleading and deceiving investors, the IRS, the SEC, 


business partners, employees, and the general public at large, and  


(II) There is a clear pattern of material irregularities found in the form 990s. Perjury is likely only 


the tip of the iceberg. 


To summarize, Robin Raina and Ebix: 


• Provide investors with inaccurate, unreliable, and incomplete financial statements. 


• Use funds that belong to taxpayers to instead fund acquisitions and excess CEO compensation. 


• Engage in transparent tax avoidance schemes.

Meanwhile, Robin Raina and the Robin Raina Foundation: 


• Misrepresent its activities, claiming to give at least 5x more than it does. 


• Submits tax returns to the IRS with blatant accounting irregularities, inaccuracies, and 


incomplete information. 


• Spends 75% on its funds on non-charitable and questionable activities.
