could be close to a settlement that would put an end to Burkle's lawsuit
against the company and avoid a proxy battle. An activist investor,
Burkle will resume his fight for control of the company's board, reports
CNBC's David Faber. Burkle is reportedly trying to have the company
remove a "poison pill" anti-takeover provision that prevents him from
acquiring additional shares, added Faber.

5/23/2018 Halftime Pt. 2: Trading Barnes & Noble in Wake of Stalled Settlement


https://www.cnbc.com/id/38676553 2/5


Noble. "We can't see anything that can reverse it."


Tilson is short Barnes & Noble and has been for some time. He said the
stock has been following the "collapse" in the company's profits over
the past couple years. The stock popped, however, when the company
announced it would attempt auctioning off the company, he said. He
viewed this as an action of "desperation" and shorted the stock even
more.


"The company may well get bought, but we doubt at a premium to
today's prices," said Tilson. "Even in this loose financing environment,
we're struggling to see who's going ot finance a business where cash
flows are in a free fall like this."


Should the bookseller go private, CNBC's Melissa Lee asked if the stock
would go down to zero. Tilson said the board might get bids, but he
thinks they would be below the current share price. Either way, he
thinks there is more downside than upside to BKS and that's why he's
shorting.


Watch the video for the full interview with Tilson.

A "RALLYING CRY" TO APPLE: INCREASE DIVIDEND


Analyst Toni Sacconaghi, of Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote an open letter

shareholders.


"I ultimately hope that, you know, our letter will be a rallying cry for
major shareholders because ultimately the board and the company are
responsible to them," he said.


Watch the video for the full conversation with Sacconaghi.
