Credibility in the Balance: Six Key Questions for INGN Management 
 
On February 8th, Muddy Waters released a report in which we stated that INGN has created 
an egregiously false narrative about its growth prospects, particularly with respect to the size 
of the U.S. total addressable market (“TAM”) for oxygen therapy.  INGN was in the quiet 
period, and thus did not respond.   
 
We present six key questions that management needs to address on its upcoming call, rather 
than hiding behind the reliably pliable sell side.  We again note that management has sold 
over $145 million of stock since going public, and therefore their credibility hinges on 
whether they will answer these questions clearly and honestly. 
	
1. You have claimed that the U.S. oxygen therapy market is $3 billion to $4 billion;1 


however, total Medicare spending on oxygen was $740 million in 2017.2  Per your own 
disclosures, Medicare forms 60% of the patient population.3  These two data sources 
yield a market of only $1.2 billion.   
 
How do you bridge the missing $1.8 billion to $2.8 billion?   
 


2. Using your suggested methodology (including data from the Kaiser Family Foundation 
on Medicare Advantage patients), we calculated that the number patients on oxygen 
therapy has been declining at a CAGR of -2.6% per annum since 2010.4  You have 
claimed the market is growing.   
 
How do you calculate market growth, and over what period of time?  
 


3. Our calculation of the 1.3 million user U.S. TAM is based on dividing CMS’s number of 
“allowed services” by 12 to find the average number of Medicare users on oxygen 
therapy at any one time (642,852).  We do this because we understand that starting from 
1.23 million Medicare beneficiaries receiving oxygen therapy overstates the number of 
users at any one time because it includes users who ceased therapy during the year, as 
well as new users. 


 
Is the average number of services per month during the year a valid base from 
which to gross up for capped out, Advantage, and non-Medicare users?  If not, then 
why? 
 


4. We listed five academic papers we cited on page 6 of our report that estimate the U.S. 
oxygen therapy market is significantly smaller than three million patients.   
 
What are the differences between their estimates and yours?

5. You suddenly removed references to WinterGreen Research from all presentations in 
January 2019.  You also recently deleted the 7% – 10% market growth claim from your 
presentations.  	
 
Why did you delete these items?	
 


6. Based on the much smaller U.S. oxygen therapy TAM we calculated of 1.3 million users, 
we modeled INGN peak sales this year or next.  This is partly due to the six-year 
estimated useful life of machines purchased by homecare providers, which impacts their 
purchasing schedules.  As we pointed out, even as the installed base and penetration 
continue to grow, sales will not. Our methodology is below.   
 
If one assumes U.S. market is only about 1.3 million users, do you agree that you 
would hit peak sales this year or next?  If not, why do you feel our conclusion is not 
accurate? 
 


 
U.S. peak unit sales 


Total U.S. oxygen therapy patients 1,306,610 
Proportion of ambulatory patients 73% 
Ambulatory oxygen population 953,825 


Penetration 90%

INGN peak market share 65% 
INGN peak installed base 557,988 


  
DTC as a percentage of unit sales 45% 


DTC installed base 251,094 
Years used / 2 = 


DTC units sold 125,547 
  


B2B as a percentage of unit sales 55% 
B2B installed base 306,893 


Years used / 6 = 
B2B units sold 51,149 


  
Peak steady-state U.S. INGN units sold per year 176,696
