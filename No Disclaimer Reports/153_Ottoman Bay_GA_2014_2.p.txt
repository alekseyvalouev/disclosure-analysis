Giant Interactive: The Cost Of Hope
Jan. 10, 2014 8:58 AM ET14 comments
by: Ottoman Bay


We believe Giant Interactive (NYSE:GA) has defrauded investors and the United States
Securities & Exchange Commission will bring charges against Chairman Shi Yuzhu and
Giant interactive.


Background:


On January 6, 2014, we released our report on Giant Interactive ("GA", "Giant" or the
"Company"), available here. On January 7, 2014, Giant Interactive's management team
released a response to our beliefs. Not only do we believe Giant's responses were
intentionally misleading, but management deliberately evaded some of the more serious
concerns from our original report.


Giant reported 87% gross margins & 61% operating margins would make it more
profitable/operationally efficient than ANY company in the entire S&P 500, any of its
peers and one of the most profitable companies in the world.


"You can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the
time, but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time." - Former President,
Abraham Lincoln


In our report we alerted investors to the Chinese margin miracle that was Giant
Interactive. Margins that were so rich, they even walloped their Chinese competition by
thousands of basis points. Upon further inspection, Giant's FY12 87% gross margins &
61% operating margins are so good it implies Giant is not only the most profitable tech
company in China, but one of the most profitable businesses in the world. So if investors
are to believe Giant's filings - that GA is able to operate an R&D intensive business in the
hyper-competitive, fragmented gaming markets with very low barriers to entry and pricing
power more efficiently than virtual monopolies like Visa Inc. and MasterCard - than either
a congratulations or subpoenas are in order.


To provide some context, we compiled a spreadsheet (here) of the entire S&P 500 &
Nasdaq detailing each company's operating margins. To our astonishment, not a single
company in the S&P 500, Nasdaq or any of Giant's Chinese peers reported operating
margins above the reported 61% GA claims. That kind of good.

Astounding, but it gets better.


There is another important "tell" in the numbers that makes Giant stand apart -- way, way
apart -- and that is its returns on capital versus other leaders in Chinas competitive
gaming category. For the FY12, Giant reported a ROIC, ROE& ROA of 212%, 35% and
26%, respectively. What a company! Any rational investor would assume that Giant
Interactive had found the cure to cancer. So, what does this cash cow actually do? Well,
Giant operates a very simple business. They are an online gaming company that operates
in a hyper-competitive space, with little pricing power and just ~4% market share of the
online gaming market. And when we contacted management to ask about their largest
customers? Well, that is a company secret.


These concerns are even more material next to the core issue: ZT is an old franchise with
declining popularity in China and Giants core business is deteriorating. To further
complicate matters, this already crowded market is expected to get even more competitive
now that the Chinese government has lifted the 14yr banned sale of game consoles -
allowing the 'big three' producers of video game consoles, Sony, Nintendo and Microsoft,
to enter the space.


In spite of having spent a mere fraction of what competitors have on R&D, and cutting
sales and marketing expense by -14%, Giant miraculously grew sales by 20%, expanded
GM's by 100bps and grew operating profit by 24% in FY12.

An investor can then conclude that Giant has no real incremental expense to additional
sales, that running a growing business in competitive markets which has seen the
company lose market share and its peers margins converge is nearly cost-free. Giant's
reported financials makes it a complete outlier in the Chinese gaming market which has
literally fallen into an "arms race" to maintain share. GA even operates far more efficiently
than internet powerhouses Tencent and Netease (despite its much smaller footprint).
Notably, the former has leveraged its scalable social networking platform to become
China's leader in the space, while Netease has invested significant R&D on its self-
developed titles along with forming strong alliances with leading global game developer
Activision Blizzard. Other Chinese leaders like Shanda Games and Changyou haven't
fared well amid increased competitive pressures and decelerating revenue growth. For
instance, online game revenues for Changyou grew just 7% in Q3, while Shanda's actually
fell 11%, with no signs of improvement anytime soon.


So perhaps Giant is this generation's Microsoft (who only saw its Windows monopoly
reach peak op. margins of 52% -- 9% below GAs, at the height of the tech bubble), at the
cutting edge of technology and operational efficiency, but it's a safe bet that isn't the case.


But if we are to believe the reported financials of this company, then investors and notably
the Chairman should be re-investing every single dollar earned in what appears to be one
of the most profitable businesses in the world - EVER. Yet, that is not the case. In fact,
from FY 2010 to FY 2012, Giant spent $28.2m, $36.6m, and $52.5m for an aggregate of
$117.2m. Conversely, Giant has spent $186m on financial investments that the company
noted "are purely financial in nature" over the same period. Furthermore, the Chairman
continues to aggressively sell shares at fire sale prices and cites "diversifying" his holdings
as the reasoning.


Furthermore, according to Giant's SAIC filings within China, in 2011, the principal
operating subsidiary reported 44% gross margins. Even considering consolidation issues
with domestic company reports, none of the subsidiaries reported a higher margin and
many reported lower. So much like a typical Chinese fraud, we believe that Giant reports
accurate financial figures to their own government where as they report fabricated
financial figures to the U.S government and U.S. investors.


Thus investors must ask themselves, if the margins are misrepresented, then the earnings
must be misrepresented -- and if the earnings are overstated -- investors must question
the willingness of any private equity firm to make good on its buyout offer.


What the Chairman says vs. What the Chairman Does

Warren Buffett once wrote to his investors:


"If you've been in the game 30 minutes and you don't know who the patsy is, you're
the patsy."


Giant Interactive shareholders - You are the patsy.


In our initial report, we expressed skepticism regarding why Chairman Shi Yuzhu
transacted more than 11% of his Giant stake in the last six months alone; notably after his
management buyout proposal and at far lower valuations (in June 2013, -62% lower) than
his purported buyout price.


In response to our report, management noted that Chairman Shi Yuzhu sold a significant
portion of his stake (despite his management buyout offer) in a purported "best in class"
87% gross margin and 61% business as "consistent with Mr. Shi's desire to diversify his
personal holdings." A fundamental conflict. Investors should find this response simply
implausible and question why the Chairman would propose a management led buyout
then choose to diversify his dollars away.


We continue to find the Chairman's selling behavior to be a significant red flag and in stark
contrast to any management buyout we've ever seen. Typically, the goal of a management
buyout is to strengthen the managers' interest in the success of the company, not
encourage the manager to liquidate his shares at artificially inflated prices once a proposal
is made.


Investors should note that post buyout the Chairman's ownership could likely be far lower
than we initially thought - liquidating to a pro-forma ownership of roughly just 20% of his
current stake.


The Chairman has spoken through his actions. Right now, GA is nothing more than a
promise ring that rests on the shoulders of leadership's credibility.


Is Shi Yuzhu & Giant Interactive telling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but
the truth?

"When truth is replaced by silence, the silence is a lie." - Yevgeny Yevtushenko


Here is a glaringly simple question, yet one which management willingly overlooked - why
did Giant's management feel it was appropriate to invest in "unregistered" shares of
Alibaba (if indeed they bought them) through the chairman and independent directors
private equity firm, Yunfeng Capital?


Furthermore, if Giant's intention was to be honest and transparent, why was Shi Yuzhu
and independent director Jason Jiang's related party affiliation to Yunfeng Capital not
disclosed in any of GA's SEC filings, particularly after the SEC raised pointed questions
about the business activities of Yunfeng?


Yunfeng's website doesn't support Giant Interactive's explanation


It amazes Ottoman Bay what type of short-term memory investors have. In 2011, Giant
Interactive was highly criticized when Giant's chairman used company resources as his
personal investment vehicle to buy an insurance company, a business that was
completely unrelated to Giant's core gaming business - . Following the debacle longtime
CFO Eric He resigned and Giant transferred the investment back to the Chairman.
Chairman Shi Yuzhu's investment is a again a violation of investors trust.


Giant responded to Ottoman Bay by misleadingly claiming that "neither Mr. Shi nor Mr.
Jiang has ever been involved in Yunfeng Capital's management, decision-making, or
governance. Mr. Shi's and Mr. Jiang's interests are strictly passive financial investments in
an established private equity fund."


We find clear evidence that Chairman Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang are NOT just passive
financial investors - they are co-founders with significant influence on Yunfeng Capital's
decision making and investment process.


1. Yunfeng notes its founding LPs expertise and analysis as part of the funds core
"strengths and highlights" for investment decisions vs. other domestic funds. This
disclosure, directly contradicts managements claims that both Jason Jiang have no
input or relationship with Yunfeng aside from being strictly financial investors


2. Yunfeng's website here - refers to Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang as "co-founders" the
company notes "Yunfeng is the result of combining the Chinese first names of Mr. Jack
MA (Yun), Chairman of Alibaba, and Mr. David YU (NYSE:FENG), Founder of Target
Media. In addition, there are more than 10 other co-founders, including Mr. Yu Zhu
SHI, Chairman of Giant interactive group"

3. We have never seen "strictly passive financial investors" promoted all over a private
equity firm's website - given their apparent lack of input or influence. Coincidentally,
after we released our article, Yunfeng conceded their misdeeds by quickly erasing any
evidence of Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiangs involvement in the fund


How can Shi Yuzhu and Jason Jiang be "strictly passive investors" yet simultaneously
provide expertise and analysis on investment decisions?


Yunfeng's link


Shortly after our note, Yunfeng's website received a much needed facelift. Yet both parties
stand by the their "belief" that they did nothing wrong.

Note that of the numerous times Jason Jiang's bio appears in Giant's filings and website,
Giant hid both parties' affiliation to Yunfeng funds; this despite Yunfeng's high profile in the
China investment community. Keep in mind, Jason Jiang and Shi Yuzhu happily posted
their picture and bio all over Yunfeng's website despite management's claims that they are
"strictly passive investors"


Giant hasn't been in compliance with NYSE requirements for years


In managements rebuttal to Ottoman Bay the company claimed that Jason Jiang was not
a related party and does satisfy NYSE independence requirements and SEC rules despite
his clear affiliation and involvement in Yunfeng.

This is a clear contradiction to the company's reported filings that we believe will be hard
for any regulator or private equity affiliate to ignore.


In Giant's FY12 filing (as can be seen below),The Company concedes that it hasn't been
in compliance with NYSE requirements for years and has no plans to. According to the
company's filings, Giant may or may not have a severe lack of corporate governance. This
disclosure goes directly to management's credibility and trustworthiness.


"We do not currently voluntarily comply with the requirement that a majority of our board of
directors consist of independent directors." - Giant Interactive 2012 20F, pg. 29


Management claims that because they are a "controlled company" that somehow Giant is
omitted from NYSE independence requirements and SEC rules. This is simply false. Any
US listed company on the NYSE is subject to the corporate governance requirements
imposed by the NYSE under Section 303A of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual. This
along with the SEC guidelines is in place to protect investors from fraudulent companies.
This lack of compliance by Giant should represent a significant red flag to investors.


Conclusion


The cost of hope - that is, the cost of making hope a component of one's investment
strategy - is the eternal risk of capital. Some sneak through like Chairman Shi Yuzhu and
make a profit before investors can get out. For others, it will come at a significant cost,
when Barings completes its prudent due diligence process and finds out the business they
were presented with is unlikely to be one of the most profitable and operatially effficient
companies in the world.


Investors will ultimately have to take their chances on a binary event - either the going
private deal passes regulatory hurdles and savvy investors like Barings doesn't catch on
and closes, or it does not, and the stock falls back to mid to low single digits - where it has
traded over the past 5 years. There is really no other outcome - no other suitors have
shown any interest in buying a business with 61% operating margins at 13x earnings. We
find limited upside from here, investors can get better returns by "diversifying their
holdings" elsewhere as Chairman Shi Yuhzu has done. We have continued to make
