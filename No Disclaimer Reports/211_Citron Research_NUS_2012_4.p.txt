CITRON PUBLISHES OPEN
LETTER TO FDA SEEKING
TRANSPARENCY ABOUT NU
SKIN’S AGELOC PRODUCTS


Yesterday, news broke
[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-09-11/l-
oreal-creams-vetted-by-fda-in-drugs-as-cosmetics-
crackdown] that as of last Friday, the FDA sent a "15-
Day Warning Letter"
[http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLette
to L'Oreal, the world's largest cosmetic company,
ordering it to cease and desist making claims for its
widely marketed cosmetics line, Lancome.  


The speci�c basis for FDA's complaint is :


" The claims on your web site indicate


that these products are intended to


affect the structure or any function


of the human body, rendering them


drugs under the Act." 


Some of the speci�c language FDA objects to is eerily
similar to, although less exaggerated than, Nu Skin's
own marketing language about "resetting gene
clusters".  Note how FDA speci�cally objects to pseudo-
medical anti-aging product claims such as :


·    "boosts the activity of genes and stimulates
the production of youth proteins"

5/18/2018 Citron Publishes Open Letter to FDA seeking transparency about Nu Skin’s AgeLOC products – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/citron-publishes-open-letter-to-fda-re-ageloc/ 2/3


Today, Citron publishes an open letter to the FDA,
requesting transparency with regard to comparable
quasi-medical claims made by Nu Skin for its �agship
product line "AgeLOC", a brand under which it sells
cosmetics, dietary supplements, electrical devices for
skin treatments, and a soon-to-be-marketed weight
management product.


Citron is not publishing this letter to impact any short-
term knee-jerk movement in the stock price.  Citron
wishes to add transparency regarding the fundamental
risks to Nu Skin's product line and the impacts on Nu
Skin's business. 


Readers are referred to Citron's August 16th story
about Nu Skin. [http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2012/08/NuSkin-Citron-
ChinaandUS1.pdf]    The exaggerated medical claims
are explicitly detailed and the strategic risks are
explored.  As well, the seriousness of the "15-Day
Warning Letter", which is really a Cease and Desist
order, is explained.


It is Citron's opinion that what is a pimple for L'Oreal
may be cancer for Nu Skin.   AgeLOC is its �agship
branding strategy, but its scienti�c foundation is highly
dubious at best.  And its own distributor training,
provided to over 160,000 reps in North America alone,
has been highly misleading.


Stanford and Purdue have an important role to play
with regard to the transparency the market needs.   We
hope they will clarify their positions soon, with regard
to their respect intellectual property reputations and
AgeLOC claims, to which their names have been
liberally appropriated by Nu Skin.
