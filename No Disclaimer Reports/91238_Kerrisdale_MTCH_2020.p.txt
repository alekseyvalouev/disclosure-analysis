We are short shares of Match Group and IAC/InterActiveCorp, two companies trying to break 
apart before an FTC lawsuit that alleges a disturbing level of civil fraud and a parallel DOJ 
criminal investigation leads to the market dumping them both. Last September, the FTC sued 
Match for tricking customers into signing up for subscriptions. Match.com protected its paid users 
from fraudsters while deliberately exposing non-paying users because as it turns out: romance 
scammers are highly effective at encouraging non-paying users to buy online dating 
subscriptions. 
 
There’s a massive problem with this of course. Facilitating and profiting from consumer fraud is a 
criminal offense and that it is why Match is the focus of a DOJ criminal investigation. The 
terms of a proposed settlement between Match and the FTC from 2018, discussed before the 
DOJ intensified its investigation, are irrelevant and its mention in Match’s response to the FTC 
lawsuit was designed to mislead investors. While the ultimate consequences of a DOJ criminal 
investigation are unknowable, we do know one thing: it involves the threat of jail time.  
 
We can deduce from IAC’s decision-making during this period that it knew enough to be 
concerned. IAC first indicated a heightened interest in pursuing a spin of Match just one day after 
FTC commissioners unanimously voted to sue Match. And IAC’s initial proposal to Match’s board 
came just two weeks after the DOJ served Match with a criminal grand-jury subpoena.  
  
One week before the DOJ served Match with the grand jury subpoena, Sam Yagan, Vice-
Chairman of Match’s board, resigned with neither notice nor explanation. More recently, Match 
Director and CEO Mandy Ginsberg also surprisingly announced she would be stepping down. 
What do Yagan and Ginsberg have in common? They were the only two (now former) members 
of Match’s board who worked at Match.com during the periods when the fraud allegedly took 
place. The notion that a DOJ criminal investigation, the ensuing departure of the only two Match 
board members with direct connections to Match.com, and IAC’s decision to spin-off Match 
are all mere coincidence is certainly not a risk we would be underwriting.  
 
It gets worse. The three separate federal investigations not only mean soaring legal costs and 
potential legal damages but more importantly, they will likely result in a lasting impact to Match’s 
business model. Measures such as requiring users to provide additional information necessary to 
verify identities will slow subscriber growth and squeeze margins – at a time when the company’s 
main asset, Tinder’s operations in North America, is already suffering dramatically decelerating 
growth. These legitimate, multi-dimensional risks threaten a company trading at an already hard-
to-justify 9x sales, and soon to be levered 4.5x if the spin-off moves forward as planned. With 
recent years’ performance inflated by the transitory lift of Tinder Gold subscriber growth, 
management is now grappling with an increasingly disillusioned user base that is churning off at 
an alarming pace. The thrill of the unexpected should be confined to going on a new date, not 
investing in the company that helped you find it. We see significant downside to shares of both 
Match and IAC.

I. Executive Summary 
 
IAC is spinning off Match to avoid massive legal, financial and reputational risk. We 
believe investors of Match and IAC are unaware of the true significance of both a lawsuit alleging 
fraud that the FTC filed against Match in September 2019, and the ongoing, parallel DOJ 
criminal investigation. 
 
Following a comprehensive 29-month investigation, the FTC concluded that Match knowingly 
and purposefully benefited from the fraudulent conduct of online dating romance scammers 
using Match.com to perpetrate their misdeeds. At the core of the most damaging charge is this: 
Match.com protected its paid subscribers from fraudsters. But it deliberately allowed online 
dating scammers access to its non-paying users in order to sell more Match.com subscriptions 
and fatten Match’s bottom line. 
 
In a bizarre symbiosis, dating site cybercriminals (who commit some of the worst frauds that the 
FTC tracks) and Match.com mutually benefited from the conversion of non-paying users to paid 
subscribers. The problem (if it isn’t already clear) is that knowingly facilitating and profiting from 
consumer fraud is illegal. By doing so, Match runs afoul of FTC statutes and regulations; as a 
public company, Match violates the federal securities laws; and — worst — it is criminal, and that 
can lead to prison terms. It’s no surprise that Match is the focus of a DOJ criminal investigation. 
 
The curious, if not downright suspicious, timing of the resignation of the Vice-Chairman of 
Match’s board, Sam Yagan, and the sudden announcement two weeks ago that Match Director 
and CEO Mandy Ginsberg would be leaving both positions by March 1, 2020, strongly suggests 
that the DOJ’s criminal case has teeth. Yagan and Ginsberg were the only two (now former) 
members of Match’s board who worked at Match.com during the periods in which they would 
have had direct knowledge of the egregious fraud described in the FTC’s complaint. Yagan 
departed shortly (and without explanation) after settlement talks with the FTC failed, but before 
Match disclosed that the DOJ had served it with a criminal grand-jury subpoena.1 The idea that 
his departure was mere coincidence strains credulity. 
  
Literally, the day after the FTC voted to approve bringing charges against Match Group Inc., IAC 
CEO Joey Levin told investors on IAC’s August 8th 2Q19 earnings call that it had “begun to more 
seriously consider” the idea of spinning off Match. 
 
About six weeks later, on September 25th, 2019, the FTC filed its lawsuit and, for the first time, 
publicly charged Match with fraud. The very next day, Match received a DOJ criminal grand-jury 
subpoena. Two weeks after that, IAC delivered a proposal for full separation of a global, $20 
billion company to members of the Match board. Total time from “begin[ning] to more seriously 
consider” the spin to a formal board proposal: 63 days. 
 
 
Market perception of risk stemming from the FTC’s action is wrong. The FTC’s core mission 
is to protect consumers. We believe that a $60 million payment for a company of Match’s size 
was never the main sticking point for either side; the focus was instead on mandated changes to 


                                                 
1 On September 27, 2019, Match filed an 8-K. It disclosed that on the previous day, it had received a 
grand-jury subpoena from the DOJ. As a practical matter, however, both agencies would likely have been 
working together, conducting parallel investigations, for months. See: Section II for detailed timeline of 
events.

Match’s business practices, which have been downplayed by Match and disregarded by the 
street. Moreover, the existence of an ongoing DOJ criminal investigation all but confirms that 
liability is not isolated to Match.com, and it renders any settlement terms proposed in 2018 
irrelevant. 
 
IAC’s spin-off of Match raises questions of fiduciary duty and conflicts of interest. 
Corporate governance is an entwined affair between IAC and Match. IAC decision makers — 
because of their fiduciary responsibilities to Match — presumably have information regarding, 
among other things, the ongoing DOJ criminal investigation and the circumstances surrounding 
the director and officer exodus at Match, but they certainly have not disclosed what they know to 
the market. And all 3 “disinterested directors” (who we believe form the entire “Match Separation 
Committee” which approved IAC’s spin proposal) have formal or informal ties to IAC. Questions 
about this, as well as questions about other conflicts of interest and potential breaches of 
fiduciary duties, may well jeopardize the separation itself. 
 
New Match is assuming significant leverage at precisely the wrong time. Match is being 
separated from IAC at 4.5x LTM EBITDA, a stretched level even if Match’s outlook were pristine 
– but an irresponsibly high one given the myriad serious legal and operational challenges it 
faces. Consensus forecasts assume legal costs — which jumped in 2H19 and are expected to 
rise year over year in 2020 (to nearly 10% of EBITDA) — to then fall back to zero (?!?) in 2021. 
That’s absurd. Beyond first order legal costs, however, are the more fundamental concerns. 
Should Congress choose to act (or if the FTC wins its suit), new regulations and/or legislation 
would inevitably impose punitive changes on Match, a company that runs 40+ dating properties.  
 
Tinder faces threat from Congress. The FTC lawsuit and the Congressional investigation of 
online dating companies highlight an overarching issue that will continue to plague Tinder’s 
business: it has enjoyed subscriber growth specifically because of the lack of security and 
protection. Beyond the financial cost of having to implement additional forms of consumer 
protection (such as identity verification or criminal background checks), Tinder, in particular, has 
benefited from a simple, frictionless sign-up process. Implementing measures that require users 
to confirm their identity by disclosing additional personal information and undergoing background 
checks will have nasty implications for subscriber growth and profit margins.  
 
Tinder subscriber trends are deteriorating. Amid this cauldron of legal risk, Tinder subscriber 
trends have deteriorated — a function of being unable to replicate the impact of monetization 
efforts like Tinder Gold. The excuse made by the company for recent underperformance fails to 
address the bigger picture: Tinder Plus, and later Tinder Gold, helped juice the bottom line, but it 
also turned online dating into a video game fewer and fewer people felt worth playing. With 
growing cultural acknowledgement of the hazards of online dating, and with growth from those 
subscriber waves now over, Tinder has a large, high-churn subscriber base and few easy growth 
strategies.

II. Key Dates in Rush to Separate Match 


 
Date Key Event 


March 2017 
After receiving a tripling in the number of reported cases of online dating scams during the 
preceding five years, the FTC launches a civil investigation into Match.com’s business 
practices. 


March 2017 – Mid-
2019 


During an in-depth 29-month investigation (6-12 months is average), the FTC uncovers 
examples of fraudulent and deceptive practices spanning nearly every aspect of 
Match.com’s business. The FTC cites Match.com’s internal statistics analyses, suggesting 
that senior executives at Match.com must have known and authorized these practices.  


November 2018 
The FTC first proposes settlement terms to Match. Match discloses that the FTC’s proposed 
terms include a consent judgement requiring changes to “the company’s business practices” 
as well as a $60 million payment.2 See: Annotated Press Release on p. 13 


May –  July 2019 Settlement negotiations between Match and the FTC end without reaching an agreement.3 
March 2017 to 
August 2019 


At some unknown point in time, the FTC apparently grants DOJ access to its Match.com 
investigative files, likely providing the DOJ with evidence of criminal misdoing.  


August 7, 2019 In a unanimous decision, the FTC approves the filing of charges against Match Group, Inc., parent company of Match.com.  


August 8, 2019 
One day after the FTC authorizes a lawsuit against Match Group Inc., IAC CEO Joey Levin 
announces on IAC’s 2Q19 earnings call that IAC is starting to seriously consider the idea of 
spinning-off Match. 


September 18, 
2019 


Exactly one week before the public learns of the FTC’s fraud charges against Match, Match 
issues a terse 8-K disclosing, without any explanation, that Sam Yagan had abruptly 
resigned as Vice-Chairman of Match’s board of directors. Yagan had served as CEO of 
Match.com from 2012-2016, a period during which, according to the FTC, Match.com had 
engaged in fraud. 


September 25, 
2019 


The FTC publicly sues Match for five counts of deceptive and unfair business practices, 
including knowingly using fake love interest advertisements to trick hundreds of thousands 
of consumers into purchasing paid subscriptions on Match.com. To drive conversions of 
non-paying users to paying subscribers, Match.com exposed millions of consumers to 
romance scammers and other fraudsters. That same day, Match issues two press releases 
defending itself. Its stock drops -10% intraday, but recovers to end down less than -2%. 


September 26, 
2019 


Match receives a DOJ grand-jury subpoena. It chooses not to disclose this information until 
after the market closes the next day, Friday, September 27, 2019 (in an 8-K) .  


October 10, 2019 Two weeks after the DOJ’s criminal investigation is disclosed, the IAC board makes a preliminary proposal to spin-off Match to the “Match Separation Committee.”  
December 2, 2019 Columbia Journalism and ProPublica publish results of their 16-month investigation, revealing that Match screens for sexual predators only for paying users of Match.com. 


December 19, 2019 
IAC and Match announce entry into a definitive agreement for full separation of Match from 
the remaining businesses of IAC. On the M&A call, Match is described as “thriving.” Net 
addition expectations for 3Q19, 4Q19, and 1Q20 have disappointed / reset lower since 
2Q19. 





                                                 
2 Match’s disclosures on the nature of the settlement talks are vague. In its 10-Q filed in August 2019, 
before being sued by the FTC lawsuit, Match describes the settlement negotiations as requiring changes in 
“the company’s” business practices without defining “the company” or hinting at the nature of the requisite 
changes.  
3 Match’s 1Q19 10-Q (filed in May 2019) describes the FTC complaint and the FTC’s settlement proposal 
but does not say that discussions had ended. In the company’s 2Q19 10-Q (filed in August 2019), the 
amended disclosure stated Match and the FTC failed to reach a settlement agreement.

III. Rushing to Separate Match 
 
IAC’s own CEO has highlighted the remarkable speed with which the transaction separating IAC 
and Match came together last year, and we agree. During a call held the week before Christmas 
to announce the final deal, IAC CEO Joey Levin thanked the analysts for “squeezing” him in, and 
expressed gratitude for the efforts of advisers who “[had] been really working around the clock to 
get these things done.” 4 He wasn’t exaggerating. Back in August 2019, Levin had said that his 
company was “going to start evaluating [spinning] more seriously from here.”5 Just 133 days 
later, despite Thanksgiving, Christmas vacation plans and even an Act of God6 getting in the 
way, Levin had secured a signed and complex agreement involving new share classes, special 
dividends, and even the sale of $120m in Los Angeles real estate.  
 
IAC’s agreement to separate Match also includes some rather unusual provisions. According to 
publicly filed deal documents, IAC retains the option, at its sole discretion, to sell up to $1.5 
billion worth of New Match equity before the spin even closes. According to the December M&A 
call, IAC plans to complete its spin-off no later than June 30, 2020. IAC has made no attempt to 
explain the urgency of the transaction. But IAC apparently can’t bear to wait six months to sell 
down its exposure to a company that in the same breath it describes as “thriving.” In fact, IAC 
appears eager to get rid of its holdings in this “thriving” company (that just missed badly on 4Q19 
earnings and had its CEO abruptly leave) so badly that—notwithstanding its fiduciary duties or its 
obligation to comply with federal securities laws—it has literally documented its right to front-run

its own shareholders, who must wait their turn to receive (and then sell?) their post-spin New 
Match stock.  
 
Why on earth would IAC do this?  
 
Naturally, IAC isn’t saying. However, we note that Barry Diller, who has sole voting rights at IAC 
through ownership of 100% of IAC Class B common stock, owns roughly 8.3 million shares of 
IAC common stock and options with an approximate value in New Match terms of: $1.5 billion.  
 
In connecting these dots, we think savvy shareholders of both Match and IAC should be asking: 
If all is “thriving” at Match, why the director and officer exodus, and what’s with the IAC rush to 
sell? And if everything isn’t thriving, what does IAC really know?  
 


IV. Spiraling Legal Risks 


Online Dating Romance Scams and Its Victims 
 
Because so much of the financial press is geared to accept and promote Match’s side of the 
story in its battle with the FTC, we thought it would make sense to explain why the FTC was at 
the company’s doorstep in the first place.  
 
Between 2015 to 2018, the number of online romance scams reported to the FTC doubled, and 
the associated losses jumped fourfold. At $143 million in 2018, online dating romance scams are 
the  #1 source of total losses that the FTC tracks. And, the popular image of a “lone wolf” 
scammer isn’t entirely accurate; a significant amount is conducted by organized cybercriminal 
groups, often overseas, who use online dating sites to defraud their victims of very large sums of 
money. Notably, although online romance scams are not the most reported form of fraud by case 
number, it is the largest in financial terms. The median amount lost is $2,600, a staggering 7x 
more than other frauds.  
 
While all forms of fraud – identify theft, business imposters, fake checks – are by very definition 
harmful, research on the psychological characteristics of online romance scam victims suggest 
they tend to be especially vulnerable because they are sensitive, intelligent, lonely, trusting, and 
impulsive. Historically, victims have skewed toward middle-aged, well-educated women. 
 
All loss statistics we have regarding online dating romance scams are almost certainly grossly 
underreported. Because of the sums of money involved, and the fact that victims have often 
established an emotional connection to the very perpetrator of the crime, victims of romance 
scam fraud are typically not outraged. Rather, they are depressed and ashamed when they 
realize that they have been deceived. There is growing academic literature on the traumatic 
psychological impact of this crime.  
 
According to one industry consultant with whom we spoke, the single most common scheme 
used by online romance scam criminals involves impersonating a member of the military who

FTC Lawsuit Count I: Match.com Used Fake Love Interest Ads to Trick 
Consumers into Paying for Subscriptions 
 
Between 2013 and mid-2018, online romance scammers who set up phony Match.com accounts 
sent instant messages and “favorites” and “winks” to large numbers of Match.com users. The 
FTC claims that in some months between 2013 and 2016, more than half of instant message 
initiations and favorites that consumers received originated from accounts that Match.com had 
specifically identified as “fraudulent.”7  
 
Once a message from a fraudster was sent to a non-paying user, Match.com quickly followed up 
with an automated advertisement allowing the user to read this message, but only after he or she 
became a paying subscriber. The fraudster is using a real paid account (sort of) on Match.com’s 
platform which is why the message that hits a non-paying user looks and feels like official 
Match.com originated messaging. A message arriving in the inbox of a lonely single under a 
Match.com banner saying “He just emailed you! You caught his eye and now he’s expressed 
interest in you…could you be the one?” can have a powerful effect.  
 
Indeed, Match.com’s own analysis showed from June 2016 to May 2018, 499,691 consumers 
were conned into signing up within just the first 24 hours of receiving messages such as the one 
above, messages which Match.com knew came from illegitimate sources.  
 
After this occurred, consumers typically were never told that the fraudulent communications 
which prompted them to sign up for a paying subscription were not from someone actually 
interested in establishing a dating relationship. In fact, it was company policy at Match.com that, 
in the event a user signed up but was then unable to contact the scam artist because in the 
interim Match.com had removed the offender for fraud, Match.com would send a misleading 
message saying: 
 


 “Please be assured, Match.com does not send members misleading 
notifications, e-mails or winks professing romantic interest. We have too much 
respect for our members to ever compromise their trust. If you have received 
communications from members with profiles that are not immediately available, 
the member may have temporarily hidden their profile.” 


 
When we reviewed this with an online dating marketing executive who has no affiliation with 
Match, his response was, “Ok, that’s just ridiculous.”  


FTC Lawsuit Count II - Match.com Deliberately Exposed Consumers to 
the Risk of Falling Victim to Fraud  
 
From 2013 to mid-2018, Match protected its paying subscribers from email communications that 
it had flagged as likely being fraudulent by requiring the messages to be reviewed before 
transmitted. It did not, however, do the same for its non-paying users. It wasn’t that Match.com 
couldn’t meaningfully protect non-paying users; Match was entirely capable of identifying the vast 
majority of messages from fraudsters. According to Match.com’s own data, 87.8% of accounts 


                                                 
7 Match’s less than vigorous defense of this statistic has been to say it is “unaware of any data that 
supports this contention.”

sending messages that Match.com withheld for the benefit of its paid subscribers were later 
confirmed to be fraudulent.  
 
Match.com is a traditional dating site that employs a paywall-based subscription business model: 
non-paying users who create profiles with basic personal information, pictures, descriptions of 
interest, etc., can view or “wink” at other users, but cannot fully engage with them unless and 
until they buy an (automatically renewing) subscription.  
 


Paid Subscribers vs. Non-Paying Users 





Source: Kerrisdale. Shown at scale regarding relative size of paid subscribers vs. non-paying 
users assuming 10% conversion ratio. 


 
As shown above, the pool of non-paying Match.com users is many times the number of paying 
subscribers. For example, Wall Street’s estimates place monthly active users for Tinder at ~60 
million, compared with just under 6 million subscribers (i.e., about 10% conversion). The same 
ratio for Match.com implies approximately 20 million non-paying users.  
 
Of course, in a numbers game where only 1 in 10 non-paying users actually convert to paying 
members, Match.com’s large pool of non-paying users (who have already indicated an interest in 
online dating) constitutes a crucial source of potential paying subscribers. The reason that 
Match.com did not withhold messages sent to this large non-paying user base from romance 
fraudsters and scammers is simple: messages from online dating romance scammers were 
extraordinarily effective at inducing non-paying users to become new paying subscribers.  
 
Between June 2016 and the beginning of May 2018, Match.com delivered approximately 4 
million emailed communications to approximately 2.25 million people who were non-paying 
users, communications that the company would have withheld as fraudulent had the recipients 
been paying subscribers. This practice resulted in 250,000 customers signing up within 24 hours 
of receiving the fraudulent email communications. In short, Match.com knowingly and 
deliberately allowed millions of consumers to be targeted by online romance scammers in order 
to directly benefit its own bottom line, and increase its paying subscriber base.  
 
With Tinder dominating Match’s equity story for so long, many investors don’t seem to realize 
that the level of Match.com’s fraudulently gained subscriber growth could have easily generated

what we estimate to be over $70 million of annual EBITDA from 2016 to 2018 (17% of the 
company’s total in 2016). This estimate is simply the number of consumers tricked into 
subscribing over the 2-year period multiplied by the cost of an annual subscription. (We would 
use the 6-month subscription rate, but as the complaint also details in another separate 
deceptive business practice employed by Match.com, virtually no one who signed up for a 
“match GUARANTEE” 6 month subscription avoided getting automatically billed for an additional 
6 months). Match.com was running a business, at the time of Match’s IPO, that used fraudsters 
as highly effective, cost-less recruitment agents. It seems like an unwarranted leap of faith — 
one we are unwilling to make — to believe that this level of deliberate deception was taking place 
only at Match.com and that nothing like it was taking place across Match’s 40+ other online 
dating websites. It wouldn’t surprise us to learn, for example, that some form of this practice took 
place at Meetic, a European version of Match.com, which is owned by Match and has a very 
similar paywall structure. 
 


The Importance of the FTC Lawsuit and Ensuing DOJ Criminal 
Investigation (and Why Wall Street Has Missed It) 
 
The FTC lawsuit and ensuing DOJ criminal investigation represent material, though ultimately 
unquantifiable, risk for Match. Like all online dating companies, Match’s businesses rely on 
creating trust among strangers looking for human connection – at the very least, fraud and 
potential criminal misdeeds at Match Group’s namesake brand represents substantial 
reputational risk. Judging by the rapid pace with which IAC is moving to separate Match, IAC is 
aware of this potential problem, but Wall Street has yet to catch on.  
 
Though the statistics in the FTC lawsuit are staggering, the most damning aspect of the FTC 
complaint is that people who worked at Match.com affirmatively knew that the company was 
benefiting from fraud. In legal terms this is referred to as mens rea, and its speaks to criminal 
intent, the basis for a DOJ criminal investigation. The DOJ will not need years to find evidence of 
criminal wrongdoing, it can move swiftly given the volume of evidence already collected by the 
FTC during its 2.5-year investigation. The DOJ is also unlikely to concern itself with the potential 
liability of some lower level IT person. We’ve all probably watched enough crime dramas on TV 
to know the score: it’s called flipping someone. In exchange for testimony and cooperation, the 
DOJ can, and will, grant immunity to lower level players in pursuit of evidence implicating senior 
executives and directors who may have known and directed the criminal activity. Thus, any 
notion that legal or operational risk is solely and definitively isolated to just one property, 
Match.com, is hopelessly wishful thinking.  
 
In a complaint that reflects 2.5 years of investigation by the FTC and is replete with Match.com’s 
own statistics, not a single individual is mentioned by name. By contrast, DOJ criminal 
investigations involve the threat of sending specific people to prison. The DOJ can grant 
immunity, but this generally requires providing investigators with something of value, something 
the FBI and/or AUSA doesn’t already know. Given the length of the FTC civil case, that almost 
certainly presents a very high bar. 
 
Neither we, nor anyone else in the public markets, can know the precise nature or extent of an 
ongoing DOJ criminal investigation involving a grand jury (which by law is secret). Investors who 
are currently underwriting Match’s (and thus IAC’s) risk, however, should consider potential signs 
that the DOJ case is serious. For example, Sam Yagan, Vice-Chairman of Match’s board 
resigned last September, abruptly and without explanation, shortly after settlement talks with the

Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC | 1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor | New York, NY 10036 | Tel: 212.792.7999 | Fax: 212.531.6153 11 





FTC failed and before Match disclosed that the DOJ had served it with a criminal grand-jury 
subpoena. And, two weeks ago, in a decision that surprised the street, Match Director and CEO 
Mandy Ginsberg announced she was stepping down, only one week before earnings and mere 
months from the biggest moment in Match’s corporate history.  
 
Notably, Yagan and Ginsberg were the only two (now former) members of Match’s board that 
worked at Match.com during the periods in which they would have had direct knowledge of 
alleged fraud at Match.com.  
 
The market has overlooked many of these developments because Match has, admittedly, been 
brilliant in controlling the narrative. In the wake of the FTC’s lawsuit, four key talking points, taken 
directly from Match’s press releases responding to the FTC, were repeated by Wall Street 
analysts, even though, in our opinion, every point was materially misleading.8 One can only 
surmise that Match (and its lawyers) regarded the FTC’s allegations as so damaging (which they 
are) that every effort had to be made to dissuade people from reading the complaint.  
 
The message Match successfully delivered to the street was:  
 


1. The lawsuit is from a previously disclosed investigation, so it isn’t news. 
2. The investigation and the lawsuit are focused on Match.com. Since the FTC presumably 


did a comprehensive review of all the dating properties Match owns, the rest of the sites 
have been vetted and cleared. 


3. The FTC referred the matter to the DOJ which declined to pursue a civil case. 
4. Match turned down a settlement involving a $60 million payment in 2018, so the impact is 


limited financially. 
 
It was a masterful piece of spin. 
 
First, the lawsuit was filed against Match Group, Inc. not Match.com, which should immediately 
indicate that the potential liability is not limited to Match.com. 
 
Second, many financial analysts simply do not know how the FTC works. There was no review of 
each and every name under the Match umbrella, because that is not how an overworked 
government agency like the FTC conducts investigations. The investigation began and ended 
with Match.com. The FTC doesn’t want or need to spend years investigating every individual 
brand within a company, especially if it determines that there is compelling evidence that senior 
level employees may have committed a crime. If the FTC finds practices that harm consumers at 
one brand, it will simply mandate changes across the rest.  
 
Third, the DOJ would never pursue a civil case in this situation, because that’s precisely what the 
FTC already did. The FTC, however, has no authority to bring criminal actions; that is the sole 
purview of the DOJ, and the DOJ is pursuing a criminal case against Match as evidenced by the 
grand jury subpoena it served on September 26, 2019. Based on a review of the circumstances 
of this case with legal experts who have worked closely with the DOJ on other matters, it is by no 
means a given that the DOJ will launch a white collar criminal investigation merely because a 
federal civil law enforcement agency asks it to. On the contrary, federal agencies frequently refer 
matters involving egregious criminal conduct to the DOJ, only to be told that the DOJ lacks the 
                                                 
8 Following news of the FTC lawsuit, sell-side research produced headlines of, FTC Lawsuit Against 
Match.com Appears Backward Looking, FTC Sues; Initial Mkt Reaction Overblown, FTC Announcement: 
1) Not New News; 2) Focused on Match.com, Not Tinder; 3) More Headline Risk Than Real Concern.

resources or the interest to pursue the case. By contrast, in November 2018, the DOJ 
announced a major initiative to address the problem of online dating victims used as money 
mules. We believe it is entirely possible that the DOJ could charge some or all of the defendants 
in the Match case with criminal RICO violations by alleging that Match.com is a criminal 
enterprise that facilitates and profits from money laundering. 
 
Perhaps the best trick the Match press release pulled however was reiterating its prior disclosure 
that “In November 2018, the FTC proposed to resolve its claims via consent judgement 
mandating certain changes in the company’s business practices, as well as a payment in the 
amount of $60 million.” “Business practices” is extremely vague, and implies something 
mundane like bolding the font used in the terms and conditions. It’s an easy term to skip over, 
and instead focus on the proposed $60 million payment, which is an inconsequential sum for a 
company with a $20 billion market cap. We believe the market has been fixated on that $60 
million figure as the maximum financial liability stemming from the FTC lawsuit ever since. 
 
As we described before, online dating romance scams are a priority for the FTC. After a lengthy 
investigation, it concluded that Match.com was knowingly and willingly exploiting the very 
problem that the FTC was trying to stop. Obviously, therefore, the focus of settlement 
negotiations would have been on the “business changes” sought by the FTC. A proposed $60 
million payment from settlement talks that began in November 2018 is no longer relevant 
(indeed, it arguably never was), but rather a red herring. 
 
We believe that the FTC’s proposed settlement included extensive, substantive changes to 
Match’s business practices such as, for example, improving the protection of non-paying users, 
removal of certain executives and directors, and independent monitoring and reporting of 
improvement. In short, the settlement meant significant, wholesale, costly changes to critical 
aspects of Match’s operations that they were simply too onerous for Match to accept. That’s why 
a $20 billion company turned down what appeared to be a paltry $60 million settlement offer; it 
wasn’t about the money, it was about the mandated business changes that came with it.  
 
Below we provide our notes on the press release Match issued in response to the FTC lawsuit.

Match Responds to FTC Lawsuit (Kerrisdale Annotations) 











This neither pertains nor 
responds to the specific 
charges in the complaint. 
Also, from 2013 to mid-
2017, users who 
subscribed before the 
fraud review process was 
completed were not 
notified of the pretext 
which tricked them into 
subscribing.  Au contraire! It was great for 


business between 2016-
2018 when we estimate 
Match generated over $70m 
per year in excess EBITDA 
through fraudulent means. 


The release includes mundane 
sounding chargeback policies instead of 
mentioning that the FTC accused 
Match.com of knowingly exposing non-
paying users to romance scams in order 
to drive up profits. 


The reader is drawn to the $60 million 
figure instead of the vaguely worded 
“company’s business practices.” The 
2018 proposed settlement is irrelevant, 
since there’s an ongoing DOJ criminal 
investigation. Given Match’s market 
cap, it seems implausible that $60m 
was the sticking point; the issue must 
have been the mandated changes to 
business practices. 


Gibberish. The FTC does not “refer” 
matters to the DOJ and then have it 
“referred back” as if it’s a hot potato. 
The sentence makes it sound as if the 
DOJ didn’t deem the matter worthy of 
its time. The complaint alleges that 
Match.com knowingly exposed 
consumers to fraud and deliberately 
benefited from it. That’s the classic 
basis for a DOJ criminal investigation. 


Makes it seem as if the problems are 
limited to the past, it’s been disclosed, 
no need to read the complaint yourself. 
Fact: The FTC does not investigate 
companies for over 2 years only to find 
evidence of nothing serious, such as 
defrauding 499k customers. 


The DOJ in this situation 
would never pursue a civil 
case in the first place, that’s 
precisely what the FTC was 
doing. Two days after this 
release, Match filed an 8K 
saying it was served with a 
DOJ criminal grand-jury 
subpoena.

V. Match Separation Transaction Concerns 
Conflicts of Interest Raise Serious Questions of Legal and Fiduciary 
Duty 
 
IAC and Match maintain the pretense that they are distinct, albeit affiliated, public companies, but 
the truth is far more complex. Match is an exceptionally large holding for IAC, accounting for over 
80% of IAC’s overall value. Our review of relevant public records also reveals that for all intents 
and purposes, IAC controls Match at every level. Consider Match’s 10-person board: Whereas 
only two Match directors are also Match executives (and they both previously worked for IAC 
directly or indirectly), five of Match’s directors (including its Chairman) are IAC executives or 
directors9; the remaining three “independent” Match directors actually have longstanding 
personal or professional ties to IAC or Barry Diller.10  


The importance of IAC’s infiltration of Match’s board of directors cannot be overstated. First, it’s 
unimaginable that Match’s board was not kept apprised of the FTC’s investigation, the FTC’s 
findings that Match had for years engaged — and still was engaging — in fraud, the ensuing 
settlement negotiations between Match and the FTC, and the FTC’s lawsuit against the company 
(not to mention the parallel private class action that swiftly followed).   


It is similarly implausible that Match’s board was not informed of the DOJ’s criminal investigation 
and has not continued to be updated about it. If decision makers at IAC know of the severity of 
Match’s misdeeds, the full extent of the DOJ’s criminal interest, and the myriad legal problems 
now facing the company — which they must, given that they constitute the majority of Match’s 
board — they are in possession of material, non-public information about Match. As such, they 
have no (legal) business actively trying to get rid of IAC’s equity position in Match without 
disclosing what they know. Yet that is exactly what they have done, at blistering speed. We 
cannot help but think that IAC was able to push through the entire spin transaction in such little 
time because, effectively, it was simply negotiating with itself. 
 
Second, we are mindful that approximately 20% of Match’s shares are held not by IAC, but by 
members of the investing public. And every member of the Match board — yes, even the 
directors from IAC — owe fiduciary duties of care and loyalty to each and every one of the non-
insider Match shareholders. We see no possible way for these directors to reconcile their duties 
to IAC with their duties to non-IAC Match shareholders, and, based on the outrageously pro-IAC 
terms of the spin, it appears clear where these directors decided their allegiance ultimately lay.  
 
Dissatisfied non-IAC Match shareholders are hardly going to be placated by the composition of 
the “New Match” board, either. The deal documents explicitly mandate that IAC CEO Joey Levin 
will be the Chairman of the board of New Match, and that New Match’s board will consist of 11 
members: the current IAC-laden Match board (minus two resigning directors) plus “three 
independent directors designated before the completion of the Transaction by IAC…” So much 
for the independence that Match touts as a benefit of the spin. 


                                                 
9  IAC’s CEO Joey Levin sits on the Match Board, along with IAC’s CFO Glenn Schiffman, IAC’s Chief 
Strategy Officer Mark Stein, IAC’s General Counsel Gregg Winiarski, and 17-year veteran of IAC’s Board, 
Alan Spoon.      
10   Ann McDaniel and Barry Diller formerly sat together on the Washington Post board; Pamela Seymon 
was a corporate law partner at IAC’s primary outside law firm; and Thomas McInerney formerly served as 
IAC’s CFO for over seven years.

Minority Shareholders Are Getting Shortchanged 
 
The deal effectively proposed and accepted by IAC appears to fleece everyone else — in 
particular, the minority public shareholders of Match. IAC can, and has, effectuated a 
complicated reorganization that dodges Match’s mounting legal risk (just in time) while receiving 
up to $5 billion in cash in the process (See Appendix I: Spin-Off Overview for more details). IAC 
can begin a completely new chapter in its corporate history, one that allows it to highlight other 
elements of its portfolio not that they are no longer under the long shadow cast by Match. 
 
Specifically, the transaction calls for $1.7 billion in IAC debt to travel to Match. Then, Match will 
drain its cash on hand and borrow an additional $500 million in new debt to fund a $3 / share 
special dividend to all shareholders (81% of which of course goes to IAC). In a clever wrinkle, 
while IAC shareholders are guaranteed to receive their dividend in cash, Match shareholders 
have been given the (bad) option of receiving either cash or shares of New Match. And any cash 
that does not go toward a dividend payment to public Match shareholders, goes to IAC (up to 
$160 million). 
 
The net result of these transactions is that Match will be levered at approximately 4.5x LTM 
EBITDA11 at close. What does Match get in return? The M&A investor presentation — which 
presumably represents IAC’s best effort to market the transaction as fair for both parties — lists 
the following benefits to Match: elimination of a dual class structure, enhanced trading liquidity, 
increased strategic flexibility, effective debt-financed stock repurchase, and S&P index eligibility.  
 
First, the potential eligibility for S&P inclusion and the elimination of a dual class structure is 
redundant (the latter enables the former). Second, “increased strategic flexibility” is questionable, 
at best, when Match is starting its new life with nearly as many federal investigations as turns of 
leverage (an equal number, if one includes the Irish authorities). Third, effective debt-financed 
stock repurchases are a luxury that any fiscally responsible company facing potentially hundreds 
of millions in penalties and legal awards (not to mention legal fees) cannot afford. That leaves 
trading liquidity as the sole “tangible” benefit of the transaction for minority shareholders. We 
suppose making it easier to exit positions of a highly levered company with little valuation 
support is a valid benefit given the terms of the deal.  
 
It’s also worth pointing out that Wall Street’s leverage figures assume two things: 1) Not a single 
penny in damages from any current (or new) legal dispute, and 2) Consensus EBITDA continues 
to treat rising legal costs, which we estimate will top $100 million this year, as a one-time item 
that terminates at the end of 2020. These both seem wildly unrealistic given the gravity of not just 
the DOJ criminal investigation and FTC fraud lawsuit, but also the legal costs surrounding private 
civil litigation stemming from the FTC complaint (which already has begun), the high stakes 
nature of a $2 billion lawsuit from a co-founder of Tinder, and the opening of what will sure to be 
a laborious and costly legal process involving the House Oversight and Reform subcommittee 
investigation. Lastly, in what seems to be an almost weekly announcement of new legal 
headaches, the Data Protection Commission of Ireland recently launched an inquiry into Match in 
relation to concerns raised by individuals in Ireland and across the EU about potential data 
privacy violations. In summary, it appears Match minority shareholders are being asked to 
surrender considerable financial flexibility at a time of massive legal risk and potential regulatory 
change, all to secure a façade of independence that is primarily in IAC’s interest.

VI.    Tinder Fatigue 
 
Online dating is a linear subscription business. From a subscriber perspective, growth can come 
from 3 places: at the top of the funnel (more installs/non-paying users), the middle (better 
conversion of those users to subscription), or retention at the bottom. The three often move in a 
coordinated fashion around a successful product launch, i.e. Tinder Gold. What’s currently 
flowing through subscriber metrics is the fading novelty of that subscription plan and growing 
disillusionment with Tinder as an effective and efficient tool to meet dating partners. 
 
On June 28, 2017, Tinder introduced Tinder Gold, a premium version of the service priced at 
$29.99, 3 times higher than a 1-month basic Tinder Plus plan. Tinder Gold granted users all of 
the same features that Tinder Plus offered, but with a powerful new addition called, “Likes You.” 
Rather than endless swiping in the often vain hope that someone you have swiped right on will 
also happen to like you back, Tinder Gold gave subscribers a pre-populated list of who had 
swiped right on them first. The New York Times called the enhancement “something like god 
mode for a dating app.”  
 
The new feature and plan was a huge hit. The next several quarters saw the number of Tinder 
net additions surge from the 224k reported in 2Q17 to 543k in 4Q17. After mostly being flat for 
the preceding 12 months, Match stock took off in the back half of 2017 as well, advancing 80%.  
 
But, what’s been happening lately at Tinder should at least be making bulls question their thesis: 
rather than typically beating of buyside and sellside expectations, Match has been missing them 
as net additions continue to decelerate. In the most recently reported quarter, Tinder added just 
220k subscribers vs. already lowered expectations of 275k heading into the print, the lowest 
performance since June 2016.  
 
What is driving this change in subscriber trends? On its 4Q19 call, CFO Gary Swidler blamed the 
weak Tinder performance on changes in Apple’s iOS 13 that make it easier for users to cancel 
subscriptions. He noted that the new iOS adoption ramped up from under 20% in October to 
around 85% in January, including a “step change” at the end of December, when users were 
forced to upgrade to iOS 13. Swidler also stated the iOS impact would last beyond 4Q19 – 
weighing heavily on 1Q20 net additions and lingering into 2Q20. 
 
There are several issues with this portrayal of what is affecting Tinder subscriber trends. 1) The 
ease of cancellation only occurs after a Tinder subscriber has decided they wish to uninstall the 
app. During the update (forced or otherwise) iOS does not stop and prompt its users to uninstall 
Tinder (or any other app). The “new experience” encountered by subscribers with iOS 13 is that 
once a consumer has already chosen to uninstall Tinder, iOS makes it clear that if they wish to 
unsubscribe in addition to uninstalling, they may do so at that time. 2) The rise in cancellations is 
therefore not a one-time “pull forward” as described by management, but a “catch-up” or 
correction. It implies Match has been over-earning, benefiting from the fact that subscribers who 
did not value the app previously still unintentionally paid a monthly bill. Apple has simply 
corrected that tendency. 
 
While we agree that iOS has played some role in weakened subscriber trends, a more holistic 
answer must include who or what is driving the decision to cancel in the first place. Think of it this 
way: if trying to understand why guests left a party, would it make sense to focus on the size of 
the back door? Or would it make more sense to question how great a party it really was? Tinder 
is losing subscribers not because of Apple, but because now that the temporary impact of Tinder

Gold has waned, Tinder has been unable to provide subscribers with additional reasons to keep 
them paying a monthly bill. It’s that inability that probably contributed to Tinder’s Chief Product 
Officer departing after less than a year on the job, one week before 4Q earnings. 


What Comes After “God mode”?  
 
The decision to monetize a user base against a built-in algorithm lies at the heart of the 
challenge now facing Tinder. The premium features first included in Tinder Plus, and later Tinder 
Gold, are no longer generating positive buzz, but instead causing increasing user dissatisfaction 
and frustration. Tinder Plus and Gold come with unlimited likes, and the act of swiping through 
profile after profile, hoping for a match, but more often being let down, can prove addictive and 
exhausting. If this is reminiscent of a casino slots player, that’s not by accident. In a 2018 
documentary, Tinder co-founder, Jonathan Badeen, admitted its algorithm had been inspired by 
variable-ratio reward schedules, such as those used by slot machines and lottery games, to 
provide the feel of unexpectedly winning. But the amount of wasted time and rejection takes its 
toll. There are numerous articles that lament Tinder’s very existence, and academic studies have 
linked usage of the app to eating disorders and low self-esteem. Google “Tinder Fatigue” and 
“Tinder Burnout” and it’s clear that criticism of Tinder is now part of pop culture consciousness. 
 
With broader interest in the app confronting growing backlash, and an inability to follow up on 
“God mode” with an equally impactful improvement, Tinder has resorted to consumable in-app 
purchases as a way to extract additional revenue from users who have already demonstrated a 
willingness to pay. These so-called a la carte options, like “Boost” and “Super Boost” are offered 
only to Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold subscribers and increase the exposure of a subscriber to 
potential matches by 10x-100x. In effect, revenue growth has shifted ever further toward 
monetization of a smaller and smaller subset of “power users” who purchase these add-ons. It 
also creates a dynamic whereby more subscribers (predominantly Tinder’s 72% male base) feel 
like the game is rigged, and the only way they can “win” at finding a match is to pay ever higher 
fees… or to go to a different app or abandon online altogether.  
 
This is not a sign of healthy, broadening, sustainable growth for a company that enjoys premium 
growth trading multiples. Efforts to lift conversion rates following Tinder Gold have failed, 
subscription revenue as a percentage of the mix is declining, replaced instead with variable, non-
recurring “Boosts” and “Super Boosts “and “Super Likes, etc. This phenomenon will continue as 
Match pursues growth in Asian markets where pay-as-you-go in-app models are favored over 
monthly subscriptions. These negative changes in earnings quality are evidenced by Match’s 
deferred revenue as a percent of total revenue.

Rising Churn 
 
Churn is arguably the most important metric in any subscription business. The chart below and 
the conclusions of this section are derived from analysis of metadata collected by a well-known 
3rd party data provider.12 It shows the blended monthly churn rate of 1-month Tinder subscribers 
across both Tinder Plus and Tinder Gold plans. These two plans account for roughly 66% of total 
subscription revenue dollars collected in the data provider’s scraping of over 1 million credit card 
receipts. We then sanity-checked the results with a monetization and customer acquisition expert 
with 6 years of direct experience in the online dating industry.

We think the analysis is useful for several reasons: the direction of the trend, the relative 
magnitude of the change, and more importantly, the timing of its start and what it means for the 
company’s ability to combat churn going forward. 
 
The data shows an unmistakable drop in churn that began in the summer of 2017, when Tinder 
Gold launched, as new $30 subscribers first began testing out the new features. Given that July 
marked the introduction of the plan, if our analysis is in the ballpark regarding churn rates for the 
cohort, we should see a surge in gross adds translate to weakening net subscriber results 
beginning roughly ~22-25 months later (1 / monthly churn % = lifetime in months of subscriber). 
Sure enough, Match reported 3Q19 results that uncharacteristically came in below buyside 
expectations on Tinder net additions; what one Wall Street analyst called a “rare hiccup.” In 
hindsight, it was the beginning of a trend. The results of the analysis should also shed doubt on 
the completeness of the answers provided by the company regarding recent subscriber 
underperformance. The rise in churn is a result of Tinder Gold’s waning influence and the 
hangover from turning finding a date into a video game. Churn is now higher than before Tinder 
Gold was first introduced. The subscription plans helped Tinder deliver strong earnings in 2018-
2019 but are now resulting in more and more subscribers canceling their plans at the first chance 
they get (and maybe try a new dating app like Bumble).

VII. International Growth  
 
With North America showing clear signs of market saturation (4Q19 represented a sequential 
decline in both subscribers and revenue), bulls have increasingly turned their gaze to the 300 
million singles in Asia that Match promotes as an attractive, underpenetrated market for future 
growth. The importance of the region cannot be understated. Based on Match public comments, 
we estimate Asia generated slightly over $300 million of revenue for the company in 2019 (15% 
of total reported revenue) up 57% year over year, an increase of ~$115 million.13 Match’s stated 
                                                 
13 On Match’s 1Q19 call, CFO Swidler noted how in the year prior, 2018, Asia generated roughly $200 
million in revenue (implied 12% of total revenue). On Match’s 4Q19 call, CEO Ginsberg noted how the

goal is to generate 25% of total revenue from Asia by 2023. Based on consensus estimates of 
$3.8 billion for 2023, this would imply revenue from Asia grows at a 30% 4-year CAGR to over 
$930 million by that time. For context, International revenue as a whole has grown at a 30% 
CAGR over the previous 4 years, when markets were less penetrated than they are now and 
competition less intense. Is it impossible to sustain this level of growth? No, but it’s far from a low 
bar. 
 
And just what is the right way to think about online dating penetration in Asia? In a 4Q18 
earnings presentation, Match provided an estimate of online dating penetration in India at 11%, 
using “total population” as the denominator in its calculation based on a Match survey of 
respondents that have ever used a dating app or site (details of the survey were not provided). 
Once the definition of addressable market is adjusted to those with access to the internet 
however, penetration as calculated by eMarketer jumps to 48%. Match did not share its survey 
results for Southeast Asian countries on the same slide but eMarketer placed Thailand, 
Indonesia, Philippines, and Malaysia as all in a similar range to India at 43-48%14. While internet 
penetration will continue to rise, these metrics suggest familiarity with online dating and overall 
penetration levels in Southeast Asia are not complete “white space” as we have heard some 
bulls describe. 
 
Asia is a great opportunity to present to investors, but we think it is a lot harder to bring to fruition 
in dating than in most other industries. See Appendix III for further discussion on the particular 
cultural challenges online dating companies face in India. 
 


VIII. Match Valuation is Nonsensical 
 
Rarely have we seen a company’s value so difficult to justify. Match is a consumer-oriented, high 
churn, subscription business that is seeing slowing rates of growth across both subscribers and 
revenue. Growth in an absolute sense, while healthy in the mid-high teens, is hardly eye-popping 
among peers, nor is its quality improving given the deferred revenue trends discussed in Section 
VI. Moreover, street forecasts include nothing for potential legal liabilities, neither in a direct 
damages sense nor for potential operational remedies that regulators may impose. Yet Match 
trades on 2020E consensus estimates of: 9x revenue, 25x EBITDA, and 33x FCF. With these 
multiples one would think Match was firing on all cylinders but in 2019, a full 40% of total 
company dating revenue came from non-Tinder properties which posted negative revenue 
growth for the third straight year. Many bullish analysts adopt a Sum-of-Parts approach to 
valuing Match, assigning Tinder’s revenue contribution (~60%) a multiple of 12-13x revenue, 
which effectively values the brand in the context of low churn, enterprise-oriented subscription 
software companies such as ServiceNow, Autodesk, and Salesforce.com. We know which we’d 
rather own. We think a more appropriately conservative multiple for Tinder combined with an 
assessment of risk arising from myriad legal challenges results in a much lower stock price for 
Match and by extension, IAC.  
 


                                                 
region had hit 17% of total revenue in 4Q19. By assuming a rise in contribution to total revenue through 
the course of the year, we estimate Asia represented 15% of total revenue on an annual basis or $315 
million.

IX. Conclusion 
 
Taking a defendant in a lawsuit at its word is simply not a responsible way to evaluate risk. When 
one understands the true nature of the FTC complaint, it becomes clear that an industry 
previously ignored by regulators has racked up too many abuses – symbiosis with hackers 
perpetrating romance scams, a blind eye towards sex offenders, inadequate policing of underage 
users. As Match adapts to the new governing landscape, slower growth and lower margins 
should result, at a time when the oversaturation and high churn of Tinder in the United States 
and Western Europe has already forced the company to miss estimates quarter after quarter. 
With Match still trading at 9x revenue, the market has yet to re-adjust to the new state of affairs – 
but one party ahead of the curve is InterActiveCorp, which is rushing to spin Match off as quickly 
as it can. A separation being marketed as setting a “thriving” company on a new path, is really 
more about kicking Match to the curb.

Appendix II: House Subcommittee Investigation 
 
On January 30, 2020, in response to a series of extremely disturbing news reports describing the 
use of its products by underage consumers and sex offenders, the House Subcommittee on 
Economic and Consumer Policy opened an investigation into Match’s user safety policies. There 
are only two Match properties we are aware of that have some form of background screening 
policy. One is at Match.com, where after a high profile lawsuit in 2011, Match.com began 
screening paid users against government sex offender registries. The other is Pairs, a Match 
brand in Japan where, in response to a torrent of crimes in the 1990s including prostitution, rape, 
and murder, the Japanese government passed legislation to reinforce security and the site 
complied with tighter screening, including ensuring users are over 18 before they can start 
chatting. All other sites under the Match umbrella – both paid and unpaid – do not conduct 
background checks.  
 
If Congress is serious in its investigation, any move toward legislating tighter identity verification 
protocols would be an encroachment on the lack of accountability and responsibility that Match 
currently maintains. While departing Match CEO Ginsberg can describe how trust and security at 
Tinder is a top priority for 2020, the initiatives she has described are merely a continuation of a 
corporate policy of doing the minimum, and only in reaction to negative press or regulatory 
pressure. Match.com implemented its screening for paid users 9 years ago and yet nothing has 
been carried over to other properties. Ginsberg went out of her way to highlight the debut of 
photo verification for Tinder on the latest earnings call – a security measure implemented by its 
closest competitor Bumble over three years ago.  
 
The issue is the collection of data and who then bears liability. As described in the December 
2019 ProPublica article on sex offenders, the principal reason Match has not implemented a 
more uniform screening protocol is because it does not collect enough information. This is 
deliberate. Match undoubtedly understands that if it did collect enough to implement tighter 
screening, it would then be inviting greater legal liability, both for not having stricter checks in 
place, and for legal responsibility arising from when a user is the victim of a crime.  
 
The other reason is more financially and operationally motivated. Even relatively small hassles 
such as two-factor mobile phone authentication, entering a last name, mandatory photo/video 
verification, biometrics, in sum or in part, could have an impact on conversion ratios across the 
industry. In time, much like we have all grown accustomed to the identity verification steps that 
online banking requires, users would of course adapt, but there would be an adjustment period, 
and the most pronounced effect would be for an app like Tinder. Tinder revolutionized the 
industry because signing up was so frictionless – no questionnaires or filling out a profile, just a 
couple clicks and a user had instant access to singles in the vicinity. It found particular appeal 
among a demographic that skews younger and is less interested in commitment. Injecting friction 
back into dating apps in order to make it safer for all would represent a significant change in user 
expectation and experience.  
 
In addition, data collected to enhance screening procedures would require a meaningful change 
in the type of information that online dating apps already struggle to secure. Investment in 
infrastructure and cybersecurity would need to be undertaken, with negative implications for 
long-term margins, not to mention reputational risk in the event of a Target or Equifax type data 
breach. In short, the Congressional inquiry that has just launched has significant implications for 
the industry. While in the present political climate it is only natural to be skeptical of Congress’s 
ability to pass any significant piece of legislation, if we had to pick one issue that (we hope?)

women and children from known sexual predators. 


Appendix III: Tinder is Big in India—At Least With Men 
 
India, in particular, is a country held up by Match as an example of the tremendous secular 
opportunity the region holds. With a macro backdrop of improving internet penetration and 
income levels, the opportunity for online dating growth is a tantalizing one but India also poses 
very distinct challenges. The title of this section borrows (plagiarizes) a headline from a Wall 
Street Journal article describing Tinder’s experience in India, because it perfectly encapsulates 
the stigma attached to online dating in a country where gender roles are still heavily affirmed. 
 
According to an industry expert, though demand is high among men in India, overall subscription 
yields are very low due to low disposable income levels (a 1-month subscription to Tinder Gold 
costs about 6x typical wireless plans in India). Given the stigma dating in general (not just online) 
carries for women, female user adoption has been difficult to stimulate, creating a heavy 
demographic imbalance in the user base. Women have felt overwhelmed by the resulting 
attention. “The barrage of messages that hits your inbox is like a swarm of locusts,” as one 
female user in India described the experience. While it is fair of bulls to expect cultural stigma to 
erode and incomes levels to rise over time, we think short of a generational revolt whereby 
young Indian women decide to Americanize themselves - monetizing online dating habits in India 
will be a costly and uneven affair. For all the hoopla over India’s potential, we would also remind 
bulls that Tinder has already been in India for over four years.
