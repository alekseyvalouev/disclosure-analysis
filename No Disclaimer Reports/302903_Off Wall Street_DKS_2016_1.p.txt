Shares Out: 112.1 MM  Market Cap: 6.63B  FYE: January 
Concept: 
1. New store sales and profitability could fall short of “street” expectations due to disappointing 
brick & mortar traffic as a result of inter-channel cannibalization and increased competition from 
online merchants.
2 


2. The operating margin expansion anticipated in FY2017 may not occur due to fixed cost 
deleveraging, gross margin pressure and costly relocations to smaller format stores.  
3. U.S. sporting goods sales now appear to be concentrated mainly among a group of large 
vendors and retailers. Therefore, the opportunity for DKS to take substantial market share via 
consolidation may be smaller than expected. 
4. Competition in certain high margin sports equipment categories and in the fast growing, high 
margin athletic apparel market (35% of DKS’ sales) is intensifying. Price competition and 
increased promotional activity should further pressure operating margins. 
 
Summary: Dick’s Sporting Goods, Inc. (DKS) is a leading retailer of sporting 
equipment, apparel and footwear.  The company was founded in 1948, and is based 
in Coraopolis, PA. At F2Q16 quarter end (July 31, 2016), the company had 649 
Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in 47 states, 72 Golf Galaxy stores in 29 states, 21 
Field & Stream stores in 10 states, 3 True Runner stores in 3 states and 2 Chelsea 
Collective stores in 2 states.  
 


Despite posting negative SSS growth in FY2015 and a 3-year EPS CAGR of 
just 7%, bullish “street” analysts believe the recent upward revaluation of DKS 
share price to an all-time high is justified based on the combination of new unit 
growth visibility over the next several years, near-term optimism regarding the 
company’s e-commerce transition to in-house, and the long-term opportunity for 
DKS to substantially grow its market share as the industry consolidates and as 
competitors like TSA go bankrupt. Bullish analysts point to the opportunity to 
capture considerable market share from the consolidation of the industry and the 
recent Chapter 11 bankruptcy of The Sports Authority (TSA) as reasons to expect 
3%+ SSS growth, double digit earnings growth and a premium PE multiple relative 
to the company’s 3-year historical average multiple of 14.5X. 


 
DKS management has proposed that the company can substantially increase 


sales from about $7.3B in FY15 (ended January 2016) to about $12B by FY20 
(ends January 2021).  In order to achieve this goal, management plans to open 225-
250 net new stores over the next 5 years, or about 45-50 stores per year.  The states 
in which Dick’s plans for the greatest number of new stores are California, Texas, 
Florida and New York, where the company believes it can open more than 100 
new stores. The notion is that DKS will become the dominant “omni-channel” 
sporting goods retailer in the US through a combination of new stores and 
increased online sales, resulting in its market share growing from the current 11% 
to a mid-teens percent share.  We think that this will be difficult to accomplish.  


 
First, while DKS’ debt free balance sheet and positive cash flow may 


provide the company with the means to grow sales by opening new stores, we 
think DKS will be challenged to grow sales and operating margins simultaneously, 
as bulls expect.  We expect new store sales productivity at DKS and overall 
company profitability to be lower than “street” bulls anticipate.
3 


 
Our research indicates that increased e-commerce penetration in the U.S. 


sporting goods market from online competitors as well as from DKS’ own omni-
channel strategy may be contributing to reduced in-store traffic levels at both new 
and existing stores, as more consumers migrate online and make less frequent trips 
to DKS brick and mortar stores.  For example, while sales growth through its e-
commerce channel is up 145% in the three years since 2012, sales per square foot 
at DKS’s brick and mortar stores declined from $193 in 2012 to $181 in 2015.  We 
think this inter-channel sales cannibalization could result in lower new store sales 
productivity, lower gross margins due to higher variable costs (shipping) and fixed 
cost deleveraging.  Furthermore, fixed cost deleveraging at DKS could result in 
more store closings and/or costly relocations to smaller format stores, potentially 
resulting in lower square footage growth than “street” bulls anticipate.   


 
In addition to lower than anticipated new store productivity from inter-


channel cannibalization and lower gross margins from fixed cost deleveraging and 
higher shipping costs, wage inflation may offset anticipated cost savings 
initiatives, also resulting in lower than expected operating margins in FY2017.  
The average salary at DKS may have to move higher to compete with Wal-Mart 
and other service oriented retailers.  Furthermore, the Fair Labor Standards Act 
(FLSA) minimum salary requirements that go into effect December 1, 2016 may 
result in additional wage pressures at DKS in FY17.  


 
The opportunity for DKS to take market share may be more challenging than 


bulls believe.  Based on our research, it appears that the top 25 retailers make up 
more than 98% of total revenues in the U.S. sporting goods industry.  In recent 
years, the industry has become more concentrated as many new, large competitors 
entered the U.S. sporting goods market, including vendors like Nike, department 
stores like Kohl’s, and online aggregators like Amazon.   


 
Based on our assessment of the U.S. sporting goods market, it does not 


appear that there are many large consolidation opportunities remaining among the 
top players in the industry.  Therefore, DKS will be forced to take market share 
mainly from existing, established competitors.  Taking share from existing, large 
players may be more difficult and more costly than bulls expect. 


 
Furthermore, our research indicates the competitive environment is 


intensifying, especially in certain high margin, fast growing sporting goods 
categories like team sports equipment and athletic apparel.  The recent 
proliferation of specialty sports retailers like Pure Hockey, ComLax, Monkey 
Sports and others may be an underestimated threat to sales of team sports 
equipment at DKS.
4 


Also, maturing growth in the “athleisure” trend, coupled with the 
proliferation of athletic apparel suppliers and retail channels suggests the active 
wear market may be nearing saturation.  As discussed in greater detail in 
discussion point 3, the sporting goods market is undergoing a meaningful 
transition, with many new vendors and retailers entering the market, and with 
existing vendors like Nike, Under Armour, Columbia Sportswear and others 
expanding distribution online through Amazon, with department stores like Kohl’s, 
and increasing market share through their own direct to consumer (DTC) channels.  
As a result, competition in the athletic apparel market (35% of total sales at DKS) 
is set to intensify for DKS, potentially pressuring sales growth and margins at the 
company. 
 


We expect revenue of $7,821M in FY2016 and $8,315M in FY2017, 
compared to “street” expectations of $7,833M and $8,551M.  We forecast adjusted 
operating profit margin of 7.0% in FY2016 and 6.9% in FY2017 versus “street” 
consensus expectations of 7.0% and 7.6%.  Finally, we look for EPS of $3.01 in 
FY2016 and $3.26 in FY2017 versus the “street’s” forecast of $3.05 and $3.71. 
Our target of $39 is approximately 12.0x our FY2017 EPS estimate, in line with 
the average forward year PE of a peer group of secularly challenged specialty 
retailers and department store mall anchors.

Background: 
 
 Founded in 1948, DKS is a leading retailer of sporting equipment, apparel 
and footwear.  The company operates retail stores under several brand names, 
including Dick’s Sporting Goods, Golf Galaxy, Field & Stream, True Runner and 
Chelsea Collective.  In addition to its retail stores, DKS sells products through e-
commerce websites at www.dickssportinggoods.com, www.golfgalaxy.com, 
www.fieldandstreamshop.com and www.caliastudio.com.  At F2Q16 quarter end 
(July 31, 2016), the company had 649 Dick’s Sporting Goods stores in 47 states, 
72 Golf Galaxy stores in 29 states, 21 Field & Stream stores in 10 states, 3 True 
Runner stores in 3 states and 2 Chelsea Collective stores in 2 states. 
 
 DKS generated sales of $7.3B in FY2015 (ended January 2016), implying 
the company has ~11% market share of the ~$66.3B U.S. sporting goods market, 
as measured by the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA).  DKS
5 


competitors include other full-line sporting goods retailers such as Academy Sports 
& Outdoors (~7% market share), mass merchandisers such as Wal-Mart (~15% 
market share), vendors such as Nike (~4.5% market share), specialty retailers such 
as Foot Locker (~8% market share), specialty outdoor retailers like Cabela’s (~ 6% 
market share), e-commerce channels like Amazon (~4% market share), and 
department stores such as Kohl’s (~4.5% market share).   
 


DKS classifies merchandise sales into 3 categories.  The apparel category 
consists of athletic apparel, outerwear, and sportswear designed for a broad range 
of activities and performance levels, as well as apparel for specific sports in men’s 
women’s and kid’s assortments.  Technical and performance specific apparel 
includes offerings for sports such as golf, tennis, running, fitness, soccer, baseball, 
football, lacrosse, hockey, swimming and cycling.  Basic sportswear includes T-
shirts, shorts, sweat suits and warm-up suits. 


 
The footwear category consists of athletic shoes for running, walking, tennis, 


fitness, cross training, basketball and hiking.  It also includes specialty footwear, 
including casual footwear and a complete line of cleated shows for baseball, 
football, soccer and lacrosse.  Other important product lines within the footwear 
category include boots, socks and accessories. 


 
The hardlines category includes equipment for team sports, outdoor 


recreation, hunting, golf, fitness, and cycling.  In team sports, DKS sells equipment 
and accessories for team sports such as football, baseball, softball, basketball, 
hockey, soccer, lacrosse and tennis.  In outdoor recreation, DKS merchandise 
assortment includes equipment for hunting, fishing, camping and water sports.  
DKS golf offerings include golf clubs and club sets, bags, balls, teaching aids and 
accessories in addition to a complete range of golf services, including custom club 
fitting, club repair, and grip and shaft installation for drivers, irons and putters. 


 
In recent years, the sales mix at DKS has shifted from hardlines to apparel 


and footwear (see Table 1).  In 2014 and 2015 the company reduced floor space 
dedicated to fitness equipment, golf and bikes and made significant investments to 
broaden its active wear offerings through “store-within-a-store” concepts (CALIA, 
Nike Field Houses, RL Sport, etc.), a move that DKS management described as a 
key driver of SSS growth in 2014 and 1H15.

While “street” bulls appear to believe that the company’s increased 
emphasis on apparel and footwear has been self imposed and should boost gross 
margins, we are skeptical.  We think some of the shift away from hardline products 
resulted from market share losses to competing e-commerce channels such as 
Amazon in fitness and other hardline categories.   


 
Furthermore, we suspect the recent “athleisure” growth trend may have 


helped drive apparel sales at DKS in recent years and influenced management’s 
decision to increase its assortment of active wear for women and launch its Chelsea 
Collective stores in 2015.  The March 2015 launch of CALIA, DKS private label 
brand marketed by Carrie Underwood, is further evidence of DKS recent 
heightened focus on the women’s active wear category.  As discussed in greater 
detail in discussion point 2, DKS increased exposure to the athletic apparel 
category, and more specifically active wear for women, may open the company up 
to more intense competition in the year ahead, as the “athleisure” trend appears to 
be maturing and nearing saturation.  
 


Over the last year, several of DKS’ sporting goods retail competitors filed 
for bankruptcy, including The Sports Authority (~3.5% market share), Sport Chalet 
(<1% market share) and City Sports (<1% market share). According to DKS 
management, the company intends to aggressively pursue the market share 
opportunity as a result of recent bankruptcies in the industry.   


 
On July 20, 2016 DKS announced the company purchased The Sports 


Authority (TSA) intellectual property assets (website, brand names, etc.) and the 
rights to acquire 31 TSA store leases, including ~20 located in CA and FL.  While 
DKS does not intend to acquire all 31 TSA store leases, we expect the acquisition 
to accelerate the company’s new store openings to 62 stores in FY2017 as 
compared to 47 new stores in FY2016.  


 
While “street” bulls believe recent competitor bankruptcies create a near 


term opportunity for DKS to increase its market share in FY2016 and FY2017, we 
are skeptical.  As discussed further in discussion point 3, intensifying competition
7 


in certain key categories such as athletic apparel and sporting equipment may 
mitigate near term market share gains, while secular threats from vendor 
disintermediation and e-commerce may accelerate market share loss at DKS in the 
long term. 
 
Discussion: 
 
1. New store sales and profitability could fall short of “street” expectations due to a 
reduction in brick & mortar traffic from inter-channel cannibalization and 
increased online sales of sporting goods products.  


 
DKS management believes the company can substantially increase its 


market share from ~11% in 2015 to a mid-teens percent share over the long term 
and become the dominant sporting goods retailer in the U.S.  To accomplish this 
market share goal, DKS plans to execute an aggressive new store growth strategy 
that will eventually see the company operating 1,100 stores in the U.S., up from 
747 at the end of FY2Q (ended July 2016).  


 
“Street” models assume DKS will open 225-250 net new stores over the next 


5 years, or about 45-50 stores per year.  Assuming square footage of 50K per store 
on average, the “street’s” unit growth projections imply DKS will achieve net 
square footage growth of 5.5%-6.0% per year. Partly as a result of the company’s 
square footage growth plans, “street” bulls view DKS as one of the best growth 
stories in hardline retailing. 
 


While DKS’ long-term market share, sales and unit growth projections seem 
aggressive, especially in light of what we estimate is an intensifying competitive 
environment (see discussion point 4), we acknowledge that DKS’ debt free balance 
sheet and positive cash flow should provide the company the means to grow sales 
by opening new stores.  Nonetheless, DKS may be challenged to grow sales and 
operating margins simultaneously, as bulls expect.  Over the long-term, some 
“street” analysts forecast operating margins at DKS to expand to 9.0% or more, 
matching the previous peak set in FY2012.  We expect new store productivity and 
overall company profitability to fall short of “street” expectations.  


 
Our research indicates that online sales of sporting goods products and DKS’ 


own omni-channel strategy may be contributing to reduced in-store traffic levels at 
company stores, as more consumers go online and make less frequent trips to DKS 
brick and mortar stores.  The resulting fixed cost deleveraging at DKS could result 
in more store closings and/or costly relocations to smaller format stores than 
“street” bulls anticipate.
8 


At the 2015 Analyst Meeting held in April 2015, DKS CEO, Ed Stack, 
announced a slowing in the pace of new store openings and shared a view that 20% 
or slightly greater than 20% of sporting goods would eventually be sold via the 
Internet. Nike, DKS largest supplier, is equally enthusiastic about online 
penetration in the sporting goods market.  At its Investor Day held in October 
2015, NKE forecasts its online sales to grow from $1.2B, or ~4% of total sales in 
2015 to $7B, or ~14% of sales by 2020, potentially positioning NKE as the most 
significant online competitor to DKS, ahead of Amazon with an estimated $2.7B in 
annual sales of sporting goods in 2014.  By comparison, e-commerce sales at DKS 
accounted for 10.3% ($749M) of total company sales in 2015.   


 
According to DKS’ CEO, “it’s time to be a bit more prudent about where 


we’re putting stores and how much we’re going to cannibalize, because this really 
is an evolving marketplace from an e-commerce standpoint.”  In conjunction with 
its revised outlook regarding e-commerce penetration, DKS management revised 
its annual unit growth outlook lower from 7%-8% to 5.5%-6.0%, stating that the 
company needed to be more cautious regarding new store sales cannibalization of 
its existing store base. DKS forecast for total sporting goods industry online sales 
penetration suggests the brick and mortar business may not be as well insulated 
from the threat of vendor DTC channels, Amazon and other e-commerce 
competitors as bulls think.  


 
In 2009, DKS embraced an “omni-channel” strategy, and in recent years 


invested heavily in e-commerce (~$100M) to defend against emerging online 
competitors in sporting goods and to develop its own e-commerce channel.  
Similar to the dislocation experienced by department store anchors, Best Buy, Pier 
One and other “omni-channel” retailers, DKS may be experiencing significant 
sales and margin pressure at its brick and mortar stores from the rapid, secular shift 
in business mix from brick and mortar to e-commerce.  


 
According to a retail industry observer with whom we spoke, the primary 


problem with an omni-channel strategy like the one DKS follows is that the e-
commerce channel can reduce the need for customers to visit the retail store.  The 
convenience of online shopping means that fewer customers are using stores like 
DKS as their primary channel for making purchases.  In-store demand for certain 
product categories tends to decline as consumer demand for those items transitions 
online, resulting in lower in-store sales.  Furthermore, the reduced in-store traffic 
has a negative knock-on effect on other in-store product categories, often forcing 
the retailer to shrink its store format.   


 
In fact, beginning in 2012, as online functionality at DKS branded websites 


improved, it appears existing customers slowly migrated online, depleting traffic 
and spending at DKS’ brick and mortar stores.  According to company filings,
9 


sales per square foot at DKS brick and mortar stores declined from $193 in 2012 to 
$181 in 2015 (see Chart 3), suggesting in-store traffic and brick and mortar store 
productivity is declining.

Similarly, as show in Table 2, we estimate SSS growth at DKS brick and 
mortar stores turned negative in 2013 and declined for 7 quarters in a row from 
F3Q14 to F1Q16.

 Despite evidence that sales productivity at DKS’ brick and mortar stores is 
in decline due to inter-channel cannibalization from increased online penetration of 
the U.S. sporting goods market, “street” bulls insist that new store productivity at 
Dick’s Sporting Goods branded stores remains above 90% (see Table 2), 
suggesting new stores sales are performing well.  This claim may not be as helpful 
to investors as they might think.  This new store productivity ratio, as reported by 
DKS, may actually obscure the sales deterioration at the company’s new and 
existing brick and mortar stores.
10 


Note that the new store productivity ratio reported by DKS is calculated by 
comparing the LTM sales per gross square foot for new stores with the LTM sales 
per gross square foot for stores included in the SSS calculation, excluding e-
commerce sales.  Since overall brick and mortar sales per square foot is in decline 
(see Chart 3), while DKS’ reported new store productivity ratio has remained 
relatively steady (see Table 2), it appears, then, that DKS’ new stores are 
experiencing a similar rate of sales productivity deterioration as the stores in the 
comp base.  As a result, dollar sales per new store may be eroding at a faster pace 
than “street” bulls forecast.  
 


Due to increased migration of customers online and intensifying competition 
in athletic wear (see discussion point 4), sales per square foot at DKS’ brick and 
mortar stores should remain under pressure, potentially pressuring profits per store 
more than bulls anticipate.  Furthermore, the new stores in CA, TX, FL & NY, 
where DKS believes it can open 100+ stores, may be less productive than bulls 
expect due to more entrenched competitors in these states.  We note that Big 5 
Sporting Goods has a significant presence in CA, Academy Sports, Cabela’s & 
Bass Pro Shops are entrenched in TX and FL and Amazon has its largest 
concentration of DCs in CA, TX, FL and NY.  
 
2. The operating margin expansion anticipated in FY2017 may not occur due to 
fixed cost deleveraging, gross margin pressure, and costly relocations to smaller 
format stores. 


 
In addition to lower in-store traffic as a result of shifting sales between 


channels, the migration of existing customers online is resulting in a shift in DKS 
expense structure, resulting in a deleveraging of fixed costs, and higher variable 
costs (shipping, marketing, e-commerce investments, etc.).  Similar to many 
department store chains, DKS appears to be struggling with the transition from a 
largely predictable, fixed cost store operating model to a more complex mix of 
fixed cost brick and mortar channel and variable cost online channel infrastructure.  


 
For example, in the 3 years since FY2012, DKS grew sales ~25% driven 


primarily by a ~23% increase in its store base.  During this same 3-year period, 
gross profits at DKS increased nearly 19% while EBIT increased just 3.7%.  In 
recent years DKS invested approximately $100M (includes capital expenditures 
and incremental SG&A spend) in supply chain upgrades, digital marketing, IT and 
talent to improve its e-commerce offering and to ready the company to bring its e-
commerce operations in-house in January 2017. The impact of these investments, 
coupled with the significant channel shift from brick and mortar to online resulted 
in a 150 bps decline in EBIT margin at DKS from 9.0% in FY2012 to 7.5% in 
FY2015.
11 


While DKS does not disclose gross margins by channel, in a correspondence 
letter to the SEC in September 2014, the company noted that, “though the cost 
components for those two channels are slightly different…the gross profit rate 
shown in the company’s income statement is indicative of the company’s gross 
profit rate for all sales regardless of channel.” While e-commerce and brick and 
mortar gross margin rates may be similar, our analysis of DKS cost structure 
indicates that the consolidated gross margin rate is under pressure from escalating 
shipping costs in the e-commerce channel and rising occupancy costs in the brick 
and mortar channel.   
 
 As shown in Table 3 below, while the cost of merchandise at DKS has 
remained relatively flat in recent years at just under 56% of total sales, escalating 
occupancy and shipping costs have contributed to a 150 bps decline in the gross 
margin rate at the company from 31.5% in FY2012 to 30.0% FY2015.  We 
estimate shipping costs at DKS increased 120 bps from 9.0% of e-commerce sales 
in FY2012 to 10.2% in FY2015, suggesting the company is not benefitting from 
scale within its e-commerce business.  We note that Amazon’s shipping costs 
experienced a similar upward move in recent years, increasing from 9.3% of sales 
in 2013 to 11.6% of sales in 2015, suggesting DKS may find it difficult to leverage 
shipping costs, even as e-commerce sales become a larger percentage of the 
company’s overall sales.

Similarly, we estimate occupancy costs as a percentage of brick and mortar 
sales at DKS increased approximately 130 bps from 11.6% in FY2012 to 12.9% in 
FY2015.  On the F1Q15 conference call with investors, DKS’ current CFO, Andre 
Hawaux, noted that the company requires ~10% total sales growth to leverage 
occupancy costs.  Since SSS growth at DKS brick and mortar stores has been

negative for several years, it appears the migration of customers on-line is resulting 
in a deleveraging of fixed costs at the company.  
 


Furthermore, according to retail industry observers, e-commerce often 
facilitates comparison shopping and enables customers to benchmark product 
pricing.  This impacts pricing power and often encourages companies like DKS to 
increase promotional activity, potentially pressuring margins and attracting more 
incentive-driven customers that only respond to discounts and promotions.  In fact, 
in recent months, we have witnessed a steep acceleration in the frequency of in-
store and online promotions from DKS, as measured by a dramatic increase in 
daily email spam, flash sales and “clearance sales.” Given intensifying price 
competition and promotional activity, rising variable shipping costs, and ongoing 
fixed cost deleveraging, gross margin results at DKS in the year ahead may fall 
short of current bullish expectations. 
 


In addition to the gross margin pressures outlined above, the channel shift to 
online may result in higher variable costs to support the e-commerce business.  
According to DKS management, bringing the e-commerce operations in-house will 
allow the company to leverage its e-commerce cost structure, resulting in annual 
SG&A savings of $25-$30M, and ~25 bps of upside to EBIT margin in FY2017 as 
compared to FY2016.  While “street” models appear to reverse e-commerce 
spending trends in the years ahead and embed lower SG&A expenses in FY2017 
and FY2018, running the e-commerce business internally may add an additional 
layer of risk for DKS and could cost more than “street” bulls currently anticipate, 
especially in year one (FY2017).   


 
According to a report published by Credit Suisse in June 2016, in the past 10 


years, as department stores grew their e-commerce business, mall anchor IT spend 
is estimated to have quadrupled from $300M, or 6% of overall capex in 2007 to 
$1.2B, or 35% of overall capex in 2016.  According to Credit Suisse, because IT 
investments tend to have much shorter life spans than non-IT investments, IT 
systems must be upgraded continuously in order to keep up with technological 
advancements, secular growth in traffic online, and to ensure data and operational 
security.   


 
As revenue mix at DKS shifts toward e-commerce (from ~10% currently to 


15% or more by 2020), we expect e-commerce related SG&A, marketing and 
capex at DKS to grow in absolute dollar terms and as a percentage of sales.  
However, unlike the department store industry where the store base is shrinking, 
DKS expects to grow its physical store base by at least ~5% per year, suggesting 
capital intensity at DKS is set to increase as total capex spending accelerates in the 
years ahead.
13 


             
 In addition to higher variable costs related to ongoing technology 
investments, higher wages may offset much of DKS’ cost savings initiatives.  Our 
research suggests brick and mortar retailers like DKS face industry-wide wage 
increases triggered by Wal-Mart’s February 2016 decision to increase its minimum 
wage to $13.38 for full-time hourly wage employees and to $10.58 for part-time 
hourly wage employees.  We note that Kohl’s and other department stores have 
announced that they are suffering from increased store expenses driven primarily 
by higher wages. 
 


According to Glassdoor, the average wage range for a retail salesperson at 
DKS is $9.04-$9.23, well below the new wage level at Wal-Mart and below the 
average wage at other service oriented retailers like Cabela’s at $10.13 and Bass 
Pro at $10.50.  DKS initially claimed that it was not impacted by recent wage 
increases because its stores offered employees a “fun” place to work.  At a recent 
Goldman Sachs investor conference in September however, DKS management 
appeared to change its stance on the subject.  According to Andre Hawaux, DKS’ 
CFO, “there’s going to be wage inflation [and] we’re going to have to figure our 
way out of it. I do believe for us, we’ll see more of it in 2017.” 


 
The average salary at DKS may have to move higher to compete with Wal-


Mart and other service oriented retailers.  Furthermore, the Fair Labor Standards 
Act (FLSA) minimum salary requirements that go into effect December 1, 2016 
may result in additional wage pressures at DKS in FY17. The new standards 
require overtime payment (over 40 hours per week) for salaried managers earning 
below $913/week or $47,500 per year versus the previous standard of $455/week 
or $23,600 per year.  Since DKS management recently revised its point of view 
regarding the impact of wage inflation on the company at the Goldman conference 
in September, the wage inflation and/or the new FLSA standards are probably not 
factored into current consensus EBIT margin assumptions and earnings estimates.  
 


Slowing in-store traffic and spend may force DKS to cut back its new store 
growth plans, close more stores, and/or invest in costly relocations to smaller store 
formats, resulting in slower square footage growth than bulls expect.   
DKS already reduced the size of its store format from 70K square feet several 
years ago to 50K square feet.  More recently, negative knock-on effects from 
increased online penetration in certain hardline categories like fitness equipment 
and golf forced DKS to reduce the amount of floor space dedicated to these 
categories.  As e-commerce penetration increases in the years ahead, an even larger 
variety of sporting goods products should transition online, potentially accelerating 
negative knock-on effects, reducing in-store traffic and further lowering store 
productivity at DKS’ brick and mortar stores.
14 


We note that 25% of the Dick’s Sporting Goods store base (~161 stores) and 
50% of the Golf Galaxy store base (~36 stores) are up for lease renewal from 
2016-2018, potentially providing DKS with a justification to close or relocate 
poorly performing stores to more relevant locations.  Furthermore, the recently 
announced store closings by Macy’s (~100 stores announced in August), Wal-Mart 
(~154 stores announced in January) and other department store mall anchor tenants 
may pressure DKS in-store traffic at certain locations, providing the company with 
additional incentive to close or relocate stores.  


 
In fact, the pace of store closings at DKS accelerated from 3 in 2014 to 8 in 


2015.  In addition, over the last 2 years, DKS relocated 20 existing stores.  Partly 
as a result of increased store relocations, pre-opening expenses as a percentage of 
total sales increased from 0.3% in 2013 to 0.5% in 2015. With sales per square foot 
at DKS’ brick and mortar stores in decline, the pace of store closings and 
relocations at DKS could accelerate in the years ahead, potentially resulting in 
lower than expected net unit growth, higher SG&A and pre-opening expenses, and 
lower EBIT margins than bulls expect.  
 


Finally, we note that DKS current guidance does not reflect any integration, 
rebranding and opening costs associated with the 31 stores the company has the 
right to acquire from TSA.  While we do not expect DKS to acquire all 31 store 
leases, costs to rebrand and integrate additional TSA stores may partially offset 
anticipated cost savings in FY2017. 
 
3. U.S. sporting goods sales now appear to be concentrated mainly among a group 
of large vendors and retailers. Therefore, the opportunity for DKS to take 
substantial market share may be smaller than expected. 


 
According to the National Sporting Goods Association (NSGA), the U.S. 


sporting goods market generated sales of approximately $66.3B in 2015.  
According to DKS management, ~46% of the U.S. sporting goods industry is 
fragmented and made up of relatively small regional chains and local mom and pop 
retailers.  DKS management believes the company will be a beneficiary of industry 
consolidation and expects the company’s market share to increase from ~11% to 
the mid-to-high teens long term.   


 
Our assessment of the U.S. sporting goods market is different.  Indeed, it 


appears that the top 25 retailers make up more than 98% of total revenues in the 
U.S. sporting goods industry, suggesting the market is actually dominated by a 
select group of large retailers, vendors and e-commerce distributors.   


 
Table 4 below shows a list of the top 25 retailers of sporting goods products 


in the U.S. by estimated sales.  Our estimated sales and store count figures are
15 


based on data collected by SGB Weekly for its 2014 Retail Top 100 U.S. Sporting 
Goods Retailers publication, public company filings, company presentations and 
press reports.  
 
Table 4: Top 25 Sporting Goods Retailers in the U.S. Based on Estimated Annual Sales

As Table 4 shows, the U.S. sporting goods industry appears to be more 
concentrated than DKS’ management and bulls seem to believe.  Accordingly, the 
opportunity for DKS to take market share may also be smaller than “street” 
analysts expect.   


 
Importantly, many players on this list are relatively new to the top 25 


ranking, including vendors like Nike and Under Armour, department stores like 
Kohl’s and e-commerce channels like Amazon and Fanatics.  Other e-commerce 
companies and vendor direct-to-consumer (DTC) businesses are growing rapidly 
as well, including Adidas, Reebok, The North Face, VF Corp (Lucy Activewear), 
Converse, Puma, New Balance and Backcountry.com.

intensifying. Price competition and increased promotional activity could pressure 
operating margins. 
 


In addition to the large retailers and vendors in the top 25 ranking in Table 4 
above, the recent proliferation of specialty sports retailers like Pure Hockey, 
ComLax, Monkey Sports, Sports Endeavors Inc. (soccer.com, etc.), and others may 
be an underestimated threat to sales of team sports equipment at DKS.   
While DKS claims that the company offers consumers a wide selection of products 
and brands that enables it to address the needs of consumers, from the beginner to 
the sports enthusiast, our store checks suggest that DKS product offerings in most 
team sports categories cater mostly to a mass market audience.  Our research 
suggests that the lack of premium product offerings at DKS, limited year-round 
selection and inadequate sport-specific expertise may be alienating high spending, 
premium customers.  


 
According to specialty sports equipment retailers with whom we have 


spoken, the privatization of youth sports and the rapid growth of club teams for 
lacrosse, hockey, soccer and other sports in the U.S. has given rise to sports 
equipment retailers and e-commerce channels that specialize in a single sport and 
that appeal to a growing number of high spending consumers that require year-
round access to high quality, sport-specific equipment, merchandise and expertise.   


 
For example, TSG Enterprises, LLC was founded in 2002 in Massachusetts 


through the purchase of a single specialty sports store dedicated to hockey.  Since 
2002, TSG expanded organically and through acquisitions and now operates 54 
retail stores in major hockey and lacrosse markets across the U.S. including MA, 
CT, NJ, NY, CO, MD and CA and as well as 7 e-commerce websites focused on 
hockey, lacrosse and goalie equipment. The company sells specialty sports 
equipment products under several e-commerce and retail banners, including Pure 
Hockey, Hockey Giant, Pure Goalie, Total Hockey and Commonwealth Lacrosse 
(ComLax).   


 
In 2014, TSG Enterprises cracked the Top 100 for U.S. Sporting Goods 


Retailers as ranked by SGB Weekly, coming in at #98.  With its recent acquisition 
of Total Hockey in August, 2016, we estimate the company will generate pro-
forma sales of ~$133M in 2016, putting it just behind Eastern Mountain Sports 
(EMS) on SGB Weekly’s list of Top 100 Sporting Goods Retailers.   


 
While TSG believes it is the largest multichannel hockey and lacrosse 


retailer in the U.S., the company thinks its most significant competitive advantage 
relative to DKS and other general sporting goods stores is its ability to better 
service the single sport, club youth athlete.  According to one store manager with 
whom we spoke, “club sports athletes today are playing and practicing year round,
17 


traveling to and participating in 10-20 or more “offseason” tournaments per year, 
in addition to playing a normal seasonal schedule. These athletes want year-round 
access to top quality equipment, advice and service that only a dedicated shop like 
ours can provide.” 


 
At ComLax, for example, every store manager is a former or current 


lacrosse player with first hand knowledge about pocket stringing and proper pad 
and helmet fitting, and is fully educated about the latest lacrosse products from 
STX, Brine, Maverik, Gait and many more brands not found at DKS. Importantly, 
several ComLax customers told us that they used to shop at general sporting goods 
stores like DKS when they first started playing sports.  Now that these athletes 
specialize in a single sport however, they tend to play with higher end equipment 
and shop almost exclusively at a ComLax store or at one of the leading lacrosse e-
commerce websites such as Universal Lacrosse, Lacrosse Unlimited or 
LacrosseMonkey.   


 
In addition to a larger in-store selection of top lacrosse brands and more 


knowledgeable staff people, specialty equipment retailers like ComLax and many 
other specialty retailers partner with various youth club teams throughout the 
country to supply their programs with equipment, uniforms and footwear, creating 
greater consumer awareness of and strengthening customer loyalty for these retail 
brands.  


 
In June 2010, Ed Stack, DKS CEO, acknowledged the importance of the 


lacrosse business to the company: 
 
“The lacrosse business is something that's just been on fire, we have gotten out ahead of this, 
we've always been in the lacrosse business and we've had a great presence of lacrosse kind of in 
the original hot beds of lacrosse, which was kind of the – from Boston to D.C. and a little bit 
down into the Carolina's. Now that lacrosse is really moving across the country both boys and 
girls, we're really very excited about it. And especially on the boys side because you can build a 
great sale of lacrosse product and run a pretty good size ticket in lacrosse by the time you get the 
helmet, you get the stick, which the kids are all buying components now, not many of them are 
buying premade sticks, they want their own shaft mixed the head and string the head themselves 
and then along with the helmet with the gloves, the shoulder pads, you build a really nice ticket 
with the lacrosse business.” 
 
The migration of dedicated, single sport athletes away from DKS to 


specialty sport retailers, like ComLax and others, suggests the company may be 
losing the battle for high spending, premium customers, especially in high margin, 
equipment heavy sports like lacrosse and hockey.  As a general “all-in-one” 
sporting goods store that caters to a broad consumer base, and operates a seasonal 
merchandising strategy for much of its sporting equipment, DKS seems ill 
prepared to meet the rising demands of the “pay-to-play” consumer, potentially
18 


resulting in reduced customer loyalty, lower in-store traffic and lower sales of high 
margin sports equipment than “street” bulls expect. 


 
In addition to emerging competition from specialty sports retailers, the 


athletic apparel market is undergoing a meaningful transition, with many new 
retailers and vendors entering the market to participate in the “athleisure” growth 
trend.  In fact, today there are more active wear product choices available to the 
consumer from a larger variety of vendors and retailers than ever before.  


 
Maturing growth in the “athleisure” trend, coupled with the proliferation of 


vendors and retail channels, suggests the active wear market may be nearing 
saturation.  As a result, competition in the athletic apparel market (35% of total 
sales at DKS) is also intensifying.  Since DKS does not sell exclusive merchandise 
from Nike, Under Armour or any other major vendors, DKS appears to have little, 
if any, merchandise scarcity, making the company vulnerable to price battles and a 
constant cycle of increased promotional activity and higher marketing spend, 
potentially pressuring margins. 


 
In recent years, many retailers launched their own private label active wear 


brands and are devoting more floor space to the active wear apparel category. 
More recently, department stores like Kohl’s and off-price retailers like DSW and 
H&M entered the category to compete against more traditional athletic apparel 
retailers like DKS, potentially setting the stage for more widespread pricing 
pressure for sports apparel sold at DKS.   
 


For example, since 2014, Kohl’s has made a sizeable investment in its 
“active and wellness” category, enhancing and expanding key national and private 
brands and providing customers with an expanded assortment of active wear 
apparel and shoes.  In fact, store managers report that the store space dedicated to 
active wear has doubled over the last year.  


 
More recently, Kohl’s announced plans to sell Under Armour products at its 


stores beginning Spring 2017.  We estimate active wear sales at Kohl’s were 
approximately $3B in 2015, or ~15% of total company sales.  “Street” analysts 
estimate that sales of Under Armour apparel at Kohl’s could approach $200M-
$300M once the supply chain is fully developed.  By comparison, “street” analysts 
estimate sales of Nike products at Kohl’s grew low double digits in 2015 to 
~$800M-$1B. 


 
While DKS management told investors on the 2Q16 conference call in 


August that the Under Armour assortment at Kohl’s will be different than at DKS, 
Under Armour contradicted this statement, saying the company would supply 
Kohl’s with the same merchandise it sells elsewhere.  We note that DKS
19 


management did acknowledge that Under Armour’s expansion into Kohl’s was 
“not a positive” for the company.    


 
Note that in 2015 Under Armour accounted for 12% of DKS’ purchased 


merchandise.  Assuming a 44% gross margin percentage, sales of Under Armour 
products at DKS may be ~$677M, or approximately 9.3% of DKS’ total sales.  
Given the significance of the Under Armour brand at DKS, and Kohl’s recent 
success with Nike in the athletic apparel category, DKS may experience share loss 
to Kohl’s in the years ahead, potentially offsetting some the shares gains from 
TSA.   


 
While “street” bulls believe the recent bankruptcies of sporting goods 


retailers will benefit DKS as DKS becomes increasingly important to its vendors, 
the evidence suggests DKS is becoming a smaller distribution channel for certain 
key, fast growing vendors like Under Armour.  In the past, wholesalers like DKS 
were the primary point of distribution for sporting goods vendors.  In recent years 
however, the sporting goods industry has experienced a dramatic shift in the way 
sporting goods equipment, footwear and apparel products are sold and purchased.  
For example, sporting goods vendors like Nike and Under Armour, which 
accounted for ~32% of DKS merchandise purchases in FY2015, have increased 
their distribution points, selling product through their own branded retail stores and 
websites and through a growing variety of brick and mortar retail channels, 
including departments stores, sporting goods stores and specialty retailers. 
 


In fact, as shown in Table 5 below, we estimate that DKS is becoming a 
smaller percentage of Under Armour’s North American sales.  Specifically, we 
estimate that DKS share of Under Armour’s North American sales fell from 17.2% 
in 2013 to 13.6% in 2015.  Even if Under Armour sales growth to DKS stays 
constant at ~3.5% Y/Y, in-line with 2015 results, DKS market share with Under 
Armour could fall to 10.6% by 2017.

Importantly, increasing the amount of goods sold direct to consumers (DTC) 
through both owned stores and online allows vendors to capture a larger 
percentage of merchandise profits.  Accordingly, it is not surprising that at its 
Analyst Day in October 2015 Nike, DKS largest vendor at 20% of merchandise
20 


purchased in 2015, announced its intention to grow its global DTC sales from 
$6.6B in 2015 to $16B by 2020.   


 
Given DKS’ heavy exposure to Nike branded products (20% of merchandise 


purchased in 2015), we think Nike’s North American DTC channel represents a 
growing threat to DKS market share in the U.S. sporting goods market.  We 
estimate that Nike’s North American DTC sales will increase from ~$3B in 2015 
(~21% of Nike’s North American sales) to ~$6.4B in 2020 (~32% of Nike’s North 
American sales), potentially making Nike’s DTC business the 3rd largest retailer of 
sporting goods in the U.S., behind DKS and Wal-Mart.  We note that other major 
suppliers to DKS, including Under Armour (12% of DKS purchased merchandise 
in 2015) and Columbia Sportswear have similar plans to grow their DTC 
distribution channels in the years ahead.  
 


This channel shift could have long-term negative implications for general 
sporting goods retailers like DKS that rely on branded products to drive traffic to 
their stores.  In order for DKS to grow its market share position as bulls expect, the 
company may have to diversify the brands it carries, invest more to grow its 
private label brands, and gain access to more exclusive brands and products that 
aren’t widely available through other distribution channels, potentially increasing 
fashion risk and resulting in more volatile traffic trends. 


 
Bulls appear to be aware of the secular threat from vendor disintermediation 


and point to DKS success in developing its private label brands (CALIA, Field & 
Stream, etc.) as evidence that the company will be able to defend its market share 
position against its own suppliers and drive in-store traffic and merchandise 
margins with sales of its own exclusive brands.   


 
For its part, DKS management claims sales of private label products have 


been ~10% of total sales over the last 3 years.  The company expects to grow its 
private label sales to $1B by 2020.  Despite the company’s optimistic growth 
target, recent correspondence documents with the SEC suggest DKS private label 
sales grew at a CAGR of just 4% from 2013 to 2015 to $793M, and shrunk as a 
percentage of total sales from 11.8% in 2013 to 10.9% in 2015.  Given the recent 
modest sales growth of DKS private label brands as compared to branded products, 
we are skeptical that private label sales will be a significant driver of traffic growth 
or a meaningful contributor to higher merchandise margins, as bulls expect.  
 
5. Recent Results 
 
 On August 12th, 5 days before the company’s scheduled F2Q16 earnings 
release, DKS issued a press release announcing that Teri List-Stoll was no longer 
EVP and CFO of DKS.  Importantly, the company provided no explanation for the
21 


sudden departure of the CFO.  While Teri List-Stoll had been named DKS’ CFO 
only a year earlier, investors might be concerned by the lack of disclosure and 
transparency regarding the departure of a key member of the executive 
management team. 
 


On August 16, DKS reported F2Q16 earnings results that exceeded 
consensus expectations and management’s previous guidance. DKS reported 
F2Q16 EPS of $0.82 versus $0.77 a year ago, ahead of the consensus estimate of 
$0.69 and above the high end of the $0.62-$0.72 guidance range. Consolidated 
SSS growth of +2.8% exceeded consensus of -2.4%, driven by market share gains 
following the earlier than expected closure of TSA stores in July. 
 
 F2Q16 results were aided by the licensed apparel business, which benefitted 
from the Cleveland Cavaliers NBA Championship and the Pittsburgh Penguins 
Stanley Cup win in June 2016.  We estimate DKS operates approximately 50 
stores in OH and 52 stores in PA, representing ~14% of DKS’ total store base.  
While management described the impact of these events as a “meaningful” 
contributor to SSS growth in the quarter, we estimate this could have added 100 
bps to SSS growth.  Given DKS’ significant exposure to these states and the one-
time nature of these events, we do not expect a similar sales growth contribution 
from the company’s licensed apparel business in FY2017.  
 
6. Financial Assumptions 
 
a.) Revenue assumptions 
 
 On a consolidated basis, we expect revenue of $7,821M in FY2016 and 
$8,315M in FY2017.  “Street” consensus estimates call for revenue of $7,833M in 
FY2016 and $8,551M in FY2017. 
 


On a gross basis, we assume DKS opens 47 new stores in FY2016 and 62 
new stores in FY2017, including 15 incremental new stores acquired from TSA.  
We think the combination of weak in-store traffic at brick and mortar stores and 
the closure of anchor department stores such as Macy's should result in accelerated 
store relocations and closures at DKS, as compared to previous years.  
Furthermore, with 25% of Dick’s Sporting Goods store base (~161 stores) and 
50% of Golf Galaxy’s store base (~36 stores) up for renewal over the next 3 years 
from 2016-2018, we expect a steady increase in closures and relocations over the 
next several years.   
 


Specifically, we assume DKS closes 8 stores in FY2016 and 15 in FY2017, 
as lease terms expire and are not renewed.  We note that 23 total store closures 
represents about 12% of the ~197 stores up for lease renewal from 2016-2018.  On
22 


a net basis, we assume DKS opens 39 new stores in FY2016 and 47 stores in 
FY2017, as compared to consensus estimates of 43 stores in FY2016 and 55 stores 
in FY2017.  We assume 9 store relocations in FY2016 and 15 in FY2017.  We note 
that if we assume 1/3rd are closed, 1/3rd are relocated and 1/3rd are renegotiated, 
that would imply approximately 22 closings and 22 relocations per year, on 
average.  Our estimates assume a slightly lower rate of relocations and closures.  


 
We assume consolidated SSS growth of 2.7% in FY2016 and 1.4% in 


FY2017, as compared to “street” estimates of 2.7% and 3.4%, respectively. Our 
consolidated SSS growth estimate of 2.7% in FY2016 is driven by our forecast of a 
21.8% increase in e-commerce sales and a 0.5% increase in brick and mortar SSS. 
Our consolidated SSS growth estimate of 1.4% in FY2017 is driven by a 13.9% 
increase in e-commerce sales and a -0.3% decrease in brick and mortar SSS.  We 
assume DKS’ brick and mortar SSS growth turns negative in F2Q17, as DKS 
comps against the TSA bankruptcy, the Cleveland Cavaliers and Pittsburgh 
Penguins championships, and the lead up to the Rio Olympics. 
 
b.) Gross margin assumptions 
 
 Table 6 shows DKS’ historical gross margin performance and our estimates 
for the next 2 years.  We expect gross margin to improve by 15 bps Y/Y in 
FY2016, due to leveraging of occupancy costs and relatively flat merchandise 
costs, partially offset by higher shipping costs.  In FY2017 we expect gross margin 
to decline by 36 bps due to intensifying price competition in athletic apparel, 
deleveraging of occupancy costs, and increased shipping costs.  By comparison, 
consensus estimates assume a gross margin rate of 30.3% in FY2016 and 30.5% in 
FY2017.

 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016e FY2017e

Y/Y change (19) (63) (63) 15 (36) 
Source: OWS estimates, company reports 
 
c.) SG&A & pre-opening expense assumptions 
 


Table 7 shows DKS’ historical SG&A and pre-opening expense as a 
percentage of sales and our estimates for the next two years.  We assume SG&A as 
a percentage of sales increases by 65 bps in FY2016 driven by higher expenses 
associated with the integration of TSA stores, investments in e-commerce and 
Olympic-related marketing costs.  In FY2017, we assume SG&A expenses decline 
40 bps Y/Y, driven by savings from bringing e-commerce in-house and a reduction 
in "one-time" expenses associated with footwear decks, the Olympics and e-
commerce.  In FY2017 we assume there will be ongoing expenses associated with
23 


the integration of TSA and e-commerce enhancements as well as modest wage 
pressure. 


 
We assume pre-opening expenses increase starting in 3Q16 through 2017, as 


DKS relocates additional stores as leases come due.  Furthermore, we expect pre-
opening expenses to increase as DKS retrofits acquired TSA stores in 2H16 and 
2017.

 FY2013 FY2014 FY2015 FY2016e FY2017e 
SG&A % of sales 22.2% 22.0% 22.1% 22.7% 22.3% 
Y/Y change (5) (20) 9 65 (40) 
Pre-opening % of sales 0.3% 0.4% 0.5% 0.5% 0.6% 
Y/Y change 6 11 3 3 6 
Source: OWS estimates, company reports 
 
d.) Other items 
 
 We assume net interest expense of $752K in FY2016 and $4M in FY2017, 
in-line with “street” assumptions.  We forecast a tax rate of 38.3% in FY2016 and 
38.5% in FY2017, in-line with “street” assumptions. Our share count assumptions 
are 111.8M in FY2016 and 108.0M in FY2017.  These assumptions are also in-line 
with those of the “street.” Finally, we expect EPS of $3.01 in FY2016 and $3.26 in 
FY2017 versus the “street’s forecast of $3.05 and $3.71, respectively. 
 
7. Valuation 
 


At $59.13, DKS shares currently trade at 15.9X the FY2017 consensus 
estimate of $3.71, a 10% premium to its historical mean PE multiple of 14.5X and 
a 49% premium to a peer group of secularly challenged specialty retailers and 
department store chains (see Table 7).  


 
We expect investors to rerate DKS earning multiple, as the proliferation of 


alternative channels of distribution from vendors, emerging specialty retailers and 
off-price wholesalers, and the migration of consumers online results in lower in-
store traffic, escalating variable costs (shipping, marketing, e-commerce 
investments), deleveraging of fixed costs and eventually lower unit growth and 
increased store closures. Our target of $39.00 is approximately 12.0X our FY2017 
EPS estimate of $3.26, a slight premium to the secularly challenged peer group 
average PE multiple of 10.7X.

8. Risks  
 
 The primary risk to our thesis is that potential market share gains from 
TSA’s bankruptcy or other competitor bankruptcies may prove larger and more 
sustainable than we expect. Based on our analysis of the U.S. sporting goods 
market, we think any future bankruptcies by regional players in the sporting goods 
market are likely to be significantly smaller than TSA, and therefore are not likely 
to be a meaningful contributor to sales growth and market share gains for DKS. 
 
 With little debt on the balance sheet, DKS could tap the debt market to make 
a transformative acquisition that could change the competitive position of the 
company in the sporting goods market.  We note that some analysts have 
speculated that DKS could purchase Cabela’s to enhance its position in the outdoor 
sporting goods market. 
 
 Finally, DKS may be able to secure exclusive product from an existing or 
new vendor that could provide the company with “product scarcity.”  The 
introduction of exclusive product could serve as a catalyst to drive customer traffic 
to DKS stores, potentially reversing recent weak traffic trends and negative SSS 
growth at DKS brick and mortar stores.
