MicroVision: Why We Don't See The Vision

by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


MicroVision has morphed its 22-year-old idea for a virtual retinal display into a tiny
projector module business.


Experts say apparent customer Sony may be using its $14.5 million MicroVision
component purchase order as a way to spruce up its consumer electronics division
for possible sale.


Sony's focus on iPhone sensors likely doesn't offer MicroVision an opportunity: Sony
wanted only the MEMS component, and MEMS won't work with the smartphone.


The market for tiny projectors is tiny, and the average sales price is declining. A
likely cancellable purchase order cannot fix those issues.


Facing nearly half-a-billion deficits, going concern issues and $2 million executive
compensation, we expect an equity raise at some point as MicroVision burns nearly
four times more cash than revenue.


By Sonya Colberg, TheStreetSweeper Senior Investigative Reporter


MicroVision's (NASDAQ:MVIS) product and future still look stunningly microscopic despite
the big frenzy over an order for its tiny projector components. The company emerged
about the time gasoline was $1 and the auto-film rewind Sure Shot cameras were the big
thing. When MicroVision went public three years later in 1996, investors plunked down
about $42 a share on the belief that the company would someday sell technology to
project images onto a user's eyeball.


Decades later, the eyeball idea has morphed into component modules for tiny projectors.
And the share price morphed to ~$2. It stayed in that range from the summer of 2013 until
recently. Then, the stock suddenly streaked to ~$4. Why? MicroVision has landed a $14.5
million component order, essentially confirmed to be from Sony (NYSE:SNE).


But TheStreetSweeper contends a $14.5 million order is still not going to morph
MicroVision's $469 million loss into a profit. Let's look at the issues we believe are
conspiring to pummel this stock back to that familiar $2 territory and below.

First, the bull case.


The bull thesis applauds further development efforts with Sony that began in April 2013.
The technology is validated through the March non-exclusive licensing agreement.
MicroVision began fulfilling $3.8 million in component orders for Sony near year's end and
will continue into 2015.


Bulls are lauding PicoP integration into some consumer products such as the Korean
OEM Celluon, which is now selling products. Sometime in the second half of the year, they
are expecting a smartphone product.


More revenue sources are needed as indicated by 4Q14 revenue/losses of $0.7 million
and $0.08 loss/share, however. Wall Street expected $1.7 million and $0.08 loss.
Oppenheimer is estimating $20 million revenue in 2015 ($0.04 loss). It estimates revenue
dropping to $12 million in 2016 ($0.20 loss).


Extrapolating from Oppenheimer's estimates, it appears MicroVision might sell $9.5 million
to Sony this year, but only $8.5 million in 2016 - which doesn't sound like a growing
market. While Northland Securities has a "buy" on MicroVision (the report was
unavailable), Oppenheimer said it prefers to remain sidelined until more revenue sources
are secured. Investors may find other viewpoints on MicroVision here.


The entire projector market is tiny. The average sales price is declining.


Worldwide, the demand for projectors is just about 8.3 million units per year. In the US, the
sales overall were up only 1 percent year over year in the fourth quarter of 2014. At the
same time, the average sales price has declined 19 percent in the United States,
according to the report. And in other countries, a few percentage points greater.


Indeed, the market for the PicoP projector - MicroVision's product - is so small that there's
no good market data on just that category's sales. Big ol' boys have tried and failed to
grow this market. Samsung (OTC:SSDIY) introduced its Galaxy Beam containing a Pico
projector several years ago. As a reviewer suspected, the novelty soon wore off, and
Samsung moved on due to what sources called low sales. Samsung tried again with the
Beam 2, but those soon went in the trash can, too.


One new purchase order obviously can't grow this niche market.

TheStreetSweeper asked engineer and KGOn Tech President Karl Guttag what he thinks
motivated Sony to spend money on Pico projector components if the field offers so little
promise.


"It could be that Sony is looking for a gimmick to help sell something," said Mr. Guttag.


An analyst agreed and pointed out that, weighed down by $1 billion in losses last year,
Sony spun off its TV business and sold its personal computer division. The company now
seems open to a sales or joint venture deal for its TV and mobile phone units, according to
Reuters' sources.


So it appears restructuring Sony could be splashing on extra cologne to try to find a
consumer electronics buyer.


Why MicroVision's Deal With Sony Does Not Open Up iPhone Opportunities


Along with its PlayStation, Sony is now primarily focusing on selling image sensors for
iPhones. At first glance, this sounds as if it might be an opportunity for MicroVision's
product. We'll hit on the chief reasons we don't think that's the case.


First, apparently unimpressed with MicroVision's IP, Sony stuck with its own intellectual
property. MicroVision's product is a module containing laser light source, circuitry to
control mirrors, and MEMS controllable mirror to direct the image. Sony elected to order
only the MEMS component.


Second, the MEMS isn't applicable to the iPhone. For smartphone camera modules, Sony
is the huge vendor of the CMOS sensor, a piece of silicon that reads light input and
converts it to digital data. But MicroVision's product paints laser beams on a screen. So it
does just the opposite.


Third, even if it would work technologically, MicroVision's product is way too big for today's
slim phones and it rapidly consumes phone batteries.


Just Building Inventory … Or Worse?


Mr. Guttag and an analyst in this field say the deal may one day break investors' hearts.


"My guess is … at best, Sony will not find a market for 1 million units to support the
roughly $8 million pre-order," said Mr. Guttag, referring to the up-front licensing payment
received.

Mr. Guttag is a retired Texas Instruments fellow, and until December 2011, CTO of
MicroVision competitor Syndiant. Mr. Guttag and another expert envision a worst case
scenario.


"If the first X-thousand units don't sell they may cancel their order," said Mr. Guttag. An
analyst who requested anonymity agreed. He added that those orders likely will become
just more inventory.


"Based on reasonable assumptions, for their product to be price competitive, this implies 1
million units," the analyst said. "That's a very high number versus the total projector
market (of about 8 million worldwide)."


Millions In MicroVision Market - Billions Needed


Beyond the cancellation risk, there's risk in the bigger picture. MicroVision's MEMS, short
for "micro electrical-mechanical system," products must be high volume to be profitable. It
is possible to make a profit selling MEMS. We can see that by comparing MicroVision ($18
million net loss in 2014) with two companies that have succeeded: InvenSense
(NYSE:INVN) ($6 million net income) and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:STM) ($128 million
net income ).


The difference? Those two built their MEMS business on the cell phone market. Why was
this possible? Billions of cell phones are sold each year. The Pico projector is a niche in
the total projector market, which is how big, again? Eight million. MicroVision would be
extremely fortunate if it could sell a million or two in the market. But even drastically
improving that -377% operating margin, it still wouldn't be profitable.


MicroVision's Own Projectors Flop


MicroVision's 2010 Pico projector product ShowWX carried a $500 price tag originally,
now out-of-stock at Amazon, and garnered only a "fair" rating from a PCMag editor. The
reviewer called it interesting, but added "the image quality isn't quite ready for prime time."


The latter version, ShowWX+, got better reviews, including this "6-out-of-10" rating, with
pros of "small and light," and cons of "only suitable for small-screen projection, weak
brightness, requires TV Out in iOS apps."


This reviewer commented:


"The lack of brightness removes all punch - watching a film at this size is like having
a story whispered at you from across a room."

The ShowWX and ShowWX+ are virtually impossible to find - anyplace. If you check
MicroVision's website, here's what you'll see:


If you click on any of the links to online retailers, here's what you'll see:


Mr. Guttag, the engineer, is negative on laser scanning, regardless of what company
offers it. "From a technology perspective, laser scanning is still a poor choice in terms of
cost, size, power efficiency and image quality," he said, referring to his preference, Texas
Instruments' (NYSE:TXN) DLP (digital light processing) and LCOS (liquid crystal on
silicon).


Consumers can find little conference projectors now that offer wireless mirroring, shown
here and here and here. And good projection capabilities are offered on today's tablets, as
well. Some examples are here and here.


Burn, Revenue and Equity Raise Issues


The four top executives running this money-losing enterprise haul in a cool $2.07 million,
with CEO Alexander Tokman's salary and stock options the highest in 2013 at $846,056.
Their company just made $3.48 million in revenue in 2014. And it burned through almost
that much - $3.25 million - in one quarter.


The company's SEC filings contain nearly seven pages of risk warnings, including:
