Glu Mobile: Coming Unglued ...

Summary


Kim Kardashian:Hollywood is declining in download rankings, right along with the
reality TV diva's stardom. The game maker now faces challenges that have virtually
wrecked other one-hit game makers.


Recent Facebook announcement is distracting hype because insiders know that
Facebook is moving away from gaming.


Aware that Kim Kardashian is fading, insiders are selling off huge chunks of Glu
Mobile shares.


Rankings have slipped down for Glu games designed to support sagging Kim
Kardashian.


Glu likely overpaid for company in a saturated racing niche, then its top racing game
skids downward, too.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Kim Kardashian and crew's fading "reign of terror," first grabbed the imagination of
mainstream media less than a year ago. It seems Ms. Kardashian's post-baby bikini shot
plastered on US Weekly's cover sold 100,000 fewer magazines than usual and sounded
the warning that the star's popularity is beginning to drain away quicker than you can say,
"Snap a salacious selfie!"


That's downright depressing news â€¦ for Glu Mobile (NASDAQ:GLUU).


The 13-year-old San Francisco, Calif. mobile game maker's free game Kim Kardashian:
Hollywood initially rocketed the share price to the stars from $3.78 to $7.47, higher than
any time since 2007.


But most investors didn't realize that when the company launched the game app on June
25, GLUU arrived late to the Kardashian party.


Ms. Kardashian's fading stardom is just the beginning of an A-list of slip-ups that we
believe make GLUU stock an ugly bet:

SLIP-UP NUMBER 1 - Kim Kardashian has taken a dramatic free-fall since the game's
debut.


Downloads of the Kim apps have fallen, reflecting the namesake's fading popularity. The
download rank is trending downward. Kim captured number 69 overall in iPhone download
ranking in early September, as the chart below shows. But the ranking has tumbled
precipitously to number 163.


Money spent on buying items as players engage in the game is reflected in the similarly
unattractive picture painted by US overall grossing rank shown below. While there has
been a slight weekend recovery, in one month, Kim's ranking fell head-over-stilettos from
number 5 to number 15. The dips keep getting lower under this falling trend.

Kim Kardashian: Hollywood revenue has been falling since July, TheStreetSweeper has
found. Bad news for GLUU's big hit.


"As long as Kim's stardom on mobile ranking charts continues, we anticipate
speculative investors will hang on for the ride," wrote a Benchmark analyst on July
31, explaining the drop from buy to hold. "But a slip on the runway will likely create
valuation pressure over rationalized performance expectations and the necessity for
the Company to generate the next big hit."


Now that the madcap wedding, quickie divorce, rapper wedding, baby bump and post-
baby-body flaunt dramas are over and Kim begins to settle into middle-aged momma-ville,
viewership of "Keeping Up With The Kardashians" is reportedly spiraling downward. If this
media slip for Ms. Kardashian continues, the ranking of her namesake game could sag
even more.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 2 - Last week's hype about the Kim Kardashian game being
distributed by Facebook is another indication that GLUU is slipping.


"Nobody plays games on Facebook anymore," said a mobile games analyst who
requested anonymity. "It's quite well known in the industry that Facebook has moved away
from games."

Zynga (ZNGA) offers the best example of the insignificance of a Facebook distribution
because when it went public in 2012, its games were distributed on Facebook. Zynga
shares flew to the $9-$14 range but after Facebook moved away from games and other
issues arose, Zynga collapsed to the $2 range where it remains stuck today.


So the announcement that Kim is now available on Facebook likely will amount to little
more than distracting hype.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 3 - Insiders say, "Sell! Sell! Sell!"


Words to live by in the mobile gaming space: hit-driven business.


"If you have a hit, you're good," an analyst said. "But when the hit goes away, you
better find another hit or you're in trouble."


Insiders know the hit won't last. That's the reason we believe they have been selling
shares faster than Kim can bat those bodacious eyelashes.


So insiders have done nothing but sell for a long time, racking up nearly $1.5 million in
sales just since Aug. 1. Chief financial officer Eric Ludwig and vice president of finance
Gregory Cannon, directly and indirectly through automatic trading plans, significantly
pared down their holdings in just three days as they sold a combined total of 268,042
shares.


Likewise, institutional shareholders know the good times are too short in this business to
even bother getting into it, as shown by the limited institutional shareholder base.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 4 - Recent GLUU games are falling apart.


In an attempt to stem Kim's decline, GLUU last month launched "Amazing Battle
Creatures," which is already losing the battle and shouldn't be counted on to make a
significant contribution to sales. In just a few days, the rank dropped precipitously from 79
to 827.

Other big GLUU games are having issues, too. Dino Hunter: Deadly Shores appears
headed for extinction. Deer Hunter 2014 and Eternity Warriors 3, both expected by the
CEO to make "a solid contribution," failed to hit the top 100 mark in the case of Deer
Hunter, while Eternity's ranking dropped miserably from 189 to 729.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 5 - GLUU pays multi-millions for game maker in saturated niche; its
top racing game then skids.


On July 30, GLUU announced the purchase of Cie Games for about $100 million, or $30
million cash and $70 million in shares.


GLUU chief executive Niccolo de Masi trumpeted the opportunity to drive home more
revenue with "Racing Rivals," the better of only two games published to that point by Cie.


But Benchmark saw big problems, writing the same day of the acquisition
announcement: "The racing genre is saturated in our view, a negative competitive
profile that will likely challenge current and future products, with limited opportunities
for lasting differentiation."


In fact, the chart below shows "Racing Rivals" has not run a good race since GLUU
acquired it for that mountain of money. Just a few months after the acquisition, the game
ranks only about 317, a severe decline in popularity from 195.

Now it looks like the acquisition has all the trappings of Zynga's disastrous $200 million
acquisition of OMGPop. Just a year after plunking down top dollar, Zynga had to shut
down the studio that made the once wildly popular "Draw Something." Zynga's stock
suffered a more than 56 percent decline, collapsing from about $6 to about $2.60, the
current range.


SLIP-UP NUMBER 6: GLUU follows the shaky lead of three stunned gaming companies.


Rovio's once-roaring Angry Birds game has fallen in rankings since its 2011 debut,
prompting last week's announcement that 16 percent or 130 staffers will lose their jobs.


Apparently recognizing the blockbuster was a viral one-hit wonder, the CEO blogged,
"We've been building our team on assumptions of faster growth than have materialized."
He added it's "very tough to produce consistent hits."


Likewise, Zynga got ahead of itself with FarmVille's early massive success and wound up
laying off 520 employees last year. And King Digital Entertainment's (KING) "Candy Crush
Saga" downward trend in rankings virtually predicted the accompanying crush in profit and
revenue. King trades for about $12 - about half the price fetched at its initial public offering
just seven months ago.


With those heady revenues from one-hit wonders burning up their companies' pockets,
game makers tend to go on spending frenzies, building more complex companies always
in search of another evasive big hit.
