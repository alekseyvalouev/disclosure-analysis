for comments about Plus500.

In addition, Gotham keeps me mindful of the fact that the Internet is global. Even though British libel
judgments are unenforceable in the United States, I have no wish to be sued for expressing my
opinions in good faith. I have written these blog posts in a deliberately restrained manner and
intentionally not directed my comments at UK persons.


Plus500, on the other hand, has no such qualms about making its marketing materials accessible in
jurisdictions where it is not authorized to operate, including the United States. The company states in
the Admission Document (p.47) that it has run afoul of advertising regulations:


In the past, the Group has been in breach of, or may have been in breach
of, and there is a risk that going forward the Group may not be in full
compliance with or may be in breach of, the laws and
regulatory requirements regarding the promotion of investment activities in
some of the jurisdictions in which it advertises. Any non-compliance with
such applicable laws or regulatory requirements could subject members of
the Group or its directors and/or employees to disciplinary action, criminal
penalties, civil lawsuits and/or fines. Further, there is a heightened risk of
the FCA imposing a sanction on Plus500UK as a result of repeated
instances of non-compliance with the financial promotions regime. Any
such action could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s
reputation, business, financial condition and operating results.


The Admission Document (p.46) notes that activity by its affiliates could subject the company to similar
risks:


Further, the Group has not investigated the local laws and regulations
which may apply to its affiliates’ activities or the relationship between the
Group and its affiliates, and the Group has no visibility or control over
whether the affiliates are conducting their advertising activities in
accordance with such laws and regulations. There is a risk that liability for
activities of affiliates which are in breach of local laws and regulations
could attach to the Group and result in civil, criminal, regulatory or other
penalties being imposed upon the Group or its directors, or that such
activities could result in or contribute to action being taken against the
Group by a regulator in any relevant jurisdiction.

Unfortunately, most affiliates use free web-hosting services or Domains by Proxy registrations that
make it very difficult to ascertain the identity and location of their owners. However, in at least one
instance there appears to be evidence that a Plus500 website, or one operated by an affiliate,
is hosted in the United States. The screenshot below is from domaintools.com:


The hosting provider in question, A Small Orange, operates a web server in St. Louis that hosts
several gambling-related domains, likely for the same affiliate marketing customer. Not only are
several of these domains advertising services illegal under US law, they also appear to violate ASO’s
terms of service. ASO did not respond to a request for comment. In an interesting coincidence, ASO’s
parent company is Endurance International Group (EIGI, no position), the most recent target of
Gotham City Research.


A full reconciliation of Plus500′s marketing activities to local investment promotion regimes is beyond
my limited resources, but suffice it to say that 500traders.com is hardly the only Plus500 marketing
website that could attract customers from jurisdictions where the company is unlicensed.

Crazy Marketing


The Whois record for 10pips.com suggests a possible undisclosed related party. “yossi sh” does not
appear to be a real person, but crazymarketing.com is one of 65 domains registered to a Vadim
Drabkin, who attended the same university, Technion, as the Plus500 founders. We already know that
10pips.com was operated by Plus500; it is unclear why it is now registered to one of Plus500′s affiliate
marketers. Note the @investhead.com email address. Investhead.com is currently a defunct website,
but it redirected to 10pips.com in 2011 and later displayed affilliate advertising for Plus500, among
others, until late 2012. This indicates that Vadim Drabkin has been acting (and possibly being
compensated) as a member of the Plus500 affiliate program while also controlling one of Plus500′s
assets.


In short, one of Plus500′s affiliates owns a domain name that was operated by the company.
