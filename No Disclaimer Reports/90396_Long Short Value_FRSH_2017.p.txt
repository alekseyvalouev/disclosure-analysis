Papa Murphy's is a troubled take-and-bake pizza chain with little prospects of long-
term survival.


Recent articles by Zack's, technical traders on social media, and other "pumpers"
have driven shares up 65% in the last month.


The company's take-and-bake pizza model is not a competitive offering.


Its same-store sales have taken a turn for the worse, falling 7.8% in Q4 2016. More
pain is likely in Q1 2017.


Papa Murphy's Holdings (NASDAQ:FRSH-OLD) owns, operates, and franchises take-n-
bake pizza stores. Papa Murphy's has a history of underperformance, marketing
struggles, and poor management. The company has been highlighted many times by
short sellers here on Seeking Alpha, including a solid write-up by Steve Quint and as
well as an SA PRO article by Andriy Blokhin.


Anyone who has followed the company over the past few years knows that the business
model that it employs has been marginal at best. Management, in the past, has believed
if it can get the right marketing plan out there, that will improve same-stores sales and
make the company a success. The simple truth is, no marketing can save Papa
Murphy's from its take-n-bake model.

Short the Model


Papa Murphy's take-n-bake model may have once been a great idea (probably in the
early 1990s), but it just won't work in the long run. Every grocery store, Big Box retailer,
convenience store, drug store, and gas station can compete with the company on price
and, for the most part, quality. You can buy a fresh take-n-bake pizza from just about
anywhere now. The reason is that the supply chain for fresh made foods has expanded
significantly in the last 20 years, due in part to changes in consumer preference and the
efficiency of delivery and management systems.


Fresh made foods ready to sell anywhere are made in central kitchens and distributed
across most major cities. It is impossible for Papa Murphy's to compete with the cost
side of a centralized kitchen model that delivers to existing third-party locations. The
company has expensive leases at high-traffic retail locations (see above picture) that
make it unsustainable. In a lot of ways, Papa Murphy's is akin to a small retailer
competing with Amazon (AMZN). It's the decentralized versus the centralized model.
Centralized models win on cost each time, which will only get better due to technological
improvements.


The company is able to accept Electronic Benefits Transfers, "EBTs," or food stamps
because the food it sells is not cooked. From reading its 10-K, it is unclear exactly how
much business this drives to the stores, but this fact alone prevents Papa Murphy's from
transitioning its business model to one where food is cooked in its stores. Long story
short, the company is doomed.

The model has turned on Papa Murphy's recently, with same-store sales of -5.2% for FY
2016 and -7.8% for Q4 2016.

The Pump


Zacks Investment Research has been pumping Papa Murphy's almost on a daily basis
since the end of March. Below is the news feed from Finviz. As you can see, they are all
Zacks articles, all pumping the stock up. There have been a total 16 articles pushing
Papa Murphy's since March 29th.


The pump by Zacks has driven other social media "technical" traders to push Papa
Murphy's stock. You can search the feeds of Twitter or StockTwits for $FRSH to see for
yourself, and you can imagine the type of buyers that have most likely purchased shares
of Papa Murphy's recently. They are likely all retail investors, as there has not been any
substantial fundamental development since the fourth-quarter results which showed
same-store sales fell 7.8% year over year. Not exactly a great fundamental story that
institutional investors want to buy in on. As the bubble pops, the stock will likely fall fast.

On top of the fundamentally broken business model, Papa Murphy's has also been
poorly managed. It has been involved in a long-standing legal battle with its franchise
owners, stemming back to 2014 (see Legal Disclosure in the most recent 10-K) over the
company misrepresenting its business. Based on the legal disclosure in the 10-K, it
seems a few of the lawsuits have been dismissed, but a few are still outstanding.


Papa Murphy's has been buying back stores from it franchise owners that no longer
wanted them since 2014, likely in part due to the poor store-level economics and in part
due to the soured relationships with franchise owners. The asset-light model the
company claims is getting less asset-light fast. It has gone from having 4% company-
owned stores to 10% company-owned stores since 2012. To top it all off, the previous
CEO, Ken Calwell, was ousted on January 9th.


Papa Murphy's has a pretty large outstanding debt position relative to its size of $109
million. Per its credit agreement, the company owes $2.1 million in payments at the end
of every quarter. If Papa Murphy's intends to keep buying back franchise locations, it will
really be struggling for cash as its same-store sales fall.
