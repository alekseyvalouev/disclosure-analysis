Namaste: Citron has exposed complete FRAUD 
that underpins the ‘Business’ of Namaste. 


Namaste could be halted by the TSXV 
 
 
Let us start by explaining to readers that in our 17 years of publishing, Citron has 
exposed more corporate fraud than any non-government agency in the world. 
 
Rarely in its history has Citron seen a fraud so blatant: for context, we honestly 
view Sean Dollinger as a walking securities violation.   If Namaste was a US traded 
company it would be halted and Dollinger would probably face criminal charges. 
 
Citron hopes that in the best interest of protecting investors, the TSXV halts 
trading until questions can be answered relating to direct fraud that is illustrated 
in this report. This will most certainly reach the hands of Namaste’s new auditors 
(which have joined at an odd time). 
 
To keep this simple and to the point, lets go right into indefensible 
FRAUD #1 
 
Fake claim of a Nasdaq Listing to get investors to buy the stock. 
 
Mr. Dollinger has promised investors a Nasdaq listing and the simple takeaway 
that comes with it, a higher share price on the back of an up-listing.  
 
In our previous report, we explained that the NASDAQ will laugh Dollinger out of 
the room given his seedy background and the company’s opaque finances.  What 
did Mr. Dollinger turn around to do... nothing crazy, just committing an act of 
securities fraud.  A video is worth 2k words.

For those who don't want to watch the video, here is a highlight from the 
transcript. 
 





This video has since been taken down from Namaste’s 420 Weekly Updates on 
YouTube, but we have another link that remains live (source).  This was not a 
casual lie or a random tweet, this was a full-on premeditated manipulation of 
public markets by lying to investors.   
 
More important than the words are that it shows Dollinger’s lack of maturity and 
respect for securities law.  Sorry Sean, you can’t fake it until you make it in this 
case. 
 
IT GETS WORSE 
 
Fraud #2: Undisclosed Related Party Sale with Proof 
 
With the hope of obtaining the NASDAQ listing on Nov 28, 2017, Namaste 
announced that it divested of its US assets, Dollinger Enterprises US Inc.   
 





“Let’s look at our accomplishment of being accepted to one of the largest stock 
exchanges in the world, and not only entering on on the lowest tier, we’ve been 
accepted on the second tier due to our requirements.  Don’t think that the Nasdaq 
just takes an application and takes a payment and their happy at the end of the 
day.  They went through our books, they went absolutely everything for 6 weeks, 
we’ve been working around the clock from the time that I went on your show and 
called out on our shareholders and investors for support and let’s get to that $3.50 
mark.” Sean Dollinger from Namaste 420 Weekly Update July 25, 2018 ** 


“with our LP sales license knocking on our doorstep, Namaste management has 
decided that it would be best for our shareholders to divest the company of our US 
assets…With the US’s federal government stance on marijuana and the current 
federal legislation in the US, Namaste management believes this is a strategic 
decision which will allow the company to explore new opportunities.”--- Sean Dollinger, 
Nov 28, 2017 Call

Citron asks, “Who in the world would want to buy a money hemorrhaging online vape 
business from Namaste?” 
 
In a direct response to that simple question, Sean Dollinger replied: 
 
“[Question:] and the buyers are arm’s length, are they?  [Sean]: absolutely! It’s a 
group out of Europe” Sean Dollinger, Nov 28, 2017 Call 
 
Namaste allegedly sold these assets for US$400k to ESC Hughes Holding Limited.   
The terms were $100k down and $25k a month (which we do have any record of 
being paid). 
 
SMOKING GUN FOR FRAUD 
 
A simple corporate search will illustrate that the purchaser is out of Ireland is not 
a third party, but rather none other than Namaste executive David Hughes.

Here is the signed version of the same document 
 
http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/ConvertTiffToPDF?storagePat
h=COR%5C2018%5C0419%5C11995491.Tif&documentNumber=P16000017747 
 
Namaste Executive (David Hughes) Bought Dollinger Enterprises.  And just in case, 
you believe his name is a coincidence, you will see that the other signatory on the 
document is none other than is Paul Burns, the HR Manager at Namaste (LinkedIN). 
 





Just to be clear, Dollinger said he sold this asset to an arm’s length party… but it 
was really sold to David Hughes who has been with Namaste since Feb 2015 (and 
Paul Burn who has been with Namaste since 2016) – can investors trust anything 
Dollinger says going forward? 
 
Namaste has lied to its shareholders, Canadian Regulators, US Regulators; and 
most of all has attempted to hide US assets from the Justice Department in an 
attempt to obtain a US listing. 
 
Citron’s theory makes this a criminal offense. 
 
Could it be possible that Namaste gave away revenues of owning Dollinger but not 
the costs?  In other words, could they be stealing money from the company?

In explaining the stated transaction from a financial viewpoint, Dollinger stated: 
 


         
 
Yet, despite claims that Namaste removed the majority of its losses, Namaste 
somehow managed to pile up larger losses than the prior year.  
 


9 Month Ended Results


Net Loss (May 31, 2017) ($6,909,390)
Remove the Majority of Losses (Assume 50.1%) ($3,461,604)
Implied Net Loss (May 31, 2018) ($3,447,786)


Actual Net Loss (May 31, 2018) ($14,543,419)
Incremental Loss ($11,095,633)  


 
With $2.6 million in inexplicable consulting fees, Citron believes that Namaste is 
paying out large sums of cash to what might be undisclosed related parties. 
 
And just in case you say…NOOOO this can’t be our CEO who would do this…just 
remember this is the same guy who just three years ago raised money based on 
the underlying promise of guaranteed returns…the SEC would have nailed him for 
this but he was living in the Bahamas. 
 





“By selling our US arm, not only will we be selling it at fair market value, which 
will give our company positive cash flow for the next twelve months, but the 
removal of the division will allow us to become profitable by the summer of 
2018.”  Sean Dollinger, Nov 28, 2017

This is Just the Tip of the Iceberg 
 
To keep the story simple, we have only disclosed two of the fraudulent activities 
we have seen at Namaste.  But we have more. 
 
Stay tuned for our next report where we discuss fraud at the Cannmart level and 
more fraudulent claims by management. 
 
Neither the regulators and nor the new auditors can look past what has been 
exposed in this report. 
 
We will forward our research to the new auditing firm to protect investors from 
any more deception. We cannot imagine Namaste passing an audit. 
 
WHAT IS NAMASTE REALLY WORTH???? 
 
Investors disregard that despite the low share price, the market cap of Namaste is 
$700 mil USD- the same value as the Vancouver Canucks. 
 
Just a few weeks ago, the largest acquisition in the Vape space occurred as 
Turning Point Brands bought Vapor Group for $24 million. 
 
Vapor Group did $48 million in revenue and $5 million in EBITDA.

Let’s pretend for a moment that there was no fraud at Namaste (tough to do) 
 
Let us also pretend that Namaste was a breakeven (even though they lost $9 
million last quarter) 
 
Then here is what Namaste is worth based on the Vapor Group Transaction.    
$0.26 cents is the answer (most of it being cash)

Citron has exposed bigger and more sophisticated frauds than this one.  Stay 
tuned for part 3. 
 
Cautious Investing to All!
