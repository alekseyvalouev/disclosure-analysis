September 9, 2020 We believe Northern Dynasty (NAK US, NDM TO) has crafted a money-losing mining plan to achieve government approv-
als. Since management is bonused on lobbying success instead of for 
producing minerals, NAK has no reason to care that the new plan is 
irrational: we think it will lose money, leave investors with a stranded 
asset, and be canceled anyway if Joe Biden is elected.


So why has NAK twisted itself into this knot? The CEO of Pebble Part-
ners, the operating entity for NAK’s low-concentration gold and cop-
per deposit, will receive $4.4 mln of the promised $12.5 mln bonus for 
winning a green light just to start the permitting process.1


We believe that the deposit cannot be mined profitably and that min-
ing majors Anglo American (AAL L) and Rio Tinto (RIO US) know that. 
AAL withdrew from its partnership in the mine in 2013 after spending 
$500 mln.2 Rio gifted its 19.1% stake in NAK to two Alaskan charities. 
One of those, the Bristol Bay Native Corporation, benefitting people 
in the impacted Bristol Bay area, promptly sold off the shares.3 The 
local people clearly don’t believe in the mine. What’s more, NAK has 
claimed poverty to dodge a feasibility study, which would demonstrate 
economic viability. Pebble CEO Tom Collier said they did not have the 
money to pay for one despite the fact they have spent $1 bln and such 
a study would cost $80 mln at most.4

Northern Dynasty  (NAK US)


The NAK proposition is on its face absurd: the company squeezes an NPV 
of $1 bln out of the new, 20-year plan that management claims requires $4.7 
bln in initial capital. That’s a terrible return compared with peers. We have 
identified two critical omissions from NAK’s economic analysis which, 
when factored in, sink the project: 


1. Initial capital costs are understated by as much as 50%. Manage-
ment admitted three years ago that costs to develop the mine, in one 
planning scenario, could be a staggering $13 bln, 2.8x the company’s 
current estimate. And yet NAK has not changed its cost estimates. 


2. Post-closure wastewater treatment is required for centuries and will 
cost billions. A former RIO executive estimated the post-closure costs 
at $4.5 bln.


The new mine plan has half the minerals of the original 25-year plan. To 
compensate for this decline, NAK increased the price of the minerals in 
its model by 20% but left operating costs unchanged from the 2011 level. 
NAK dialed up the positives but left out the negatives. 


After spending close to $1 bln in to develop the Pebble deposit, NAK still 
cannot say if the deposit is economically viable and has failed to produce 
a feasibility study. We believe it is because they know it will demonstrate 
the mine is not economically viable. Pebble Project Timeline

Northern Dynasty  (NAK US)


We have reviewed thousands of pages of documents produced for the mine 
plan, the environmental impact statement (EIS) and legal proceedings and 
consulted mining engineers, geologists, legal experts, and environmental 
scientists to conclude that the Pebble gold/copper deposit is unlikely ever 
to be mined. Management is playing political games that benefit them-
selves, not investors. 


Gaslighting investors


NAK management, after years of struggle, had the final Environmental Impact 
Statement released by the U.S. Army Core of Engineers3 (USACE) and hopes 
to get a federal mining permit for the 20-year mine. To get around the lack of 
economic viability for the 20-year plan, management is openly saying that, 
once the plan is under way, they will push forward with another 58 years.5 
Management claims they will not need any additional environmental approv-
al to extend the life of the mine. That is untrue: the permit is for 20 years. Any 
mine extension will produce exponentially higher amounts of waste creating, 
we believe, an impossible hurdle for both approval and economic viability.

Northern Dynasty  (NAK US)


No economic viability
NAK is trying to placate both investors and environmental officials. To do 
that, management is claiming that the new, 20-year mine plan will require 
more or less the same initial infrastructure and investment as the old plan 
and still turn a profit.6 NAK’s official estimate of initial capital costs is $4.7 
bln. 


Management has submitted this $4.7 bln number even though they admit 
that one “planning scenario” had the costs at $13 bln instead. NAK has 
never disclosed that “planning scenario,” which was commissioned by one-
time investor AAL to assess the viability of a project in which they had a 
50% interest.. 


NAK doesn’t even stand by its own estimate. In 2012, the CEO of Pebble 
Partners, the operating entity for the project, said that costs might be 
nearly double that number--$7-$8 bln.7


6  When we use the term “old mine plan” or “original mine” we refer to the mining plan first 
submitted to the USACE in 2017 for the Environmental Impact Statement and most recently 
updated in June 2020. When we use the term “old mine plan” we refer to the mining plan 
in the Preliminary Economic Assessment in 2011 which had a 25, 45 and 78 year plan. For 
reference, we compare 25-year portion of the preliminary assessment with the new mine 
plan.


7  https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/film/alaska-gold/transcript/ note the CEO made this 
statement in 2012 after the 2011 PEA was published. NAK affirmed this estimate of $7-
$8b in its defence of a class action lawsuit accusing the company of securities fraud see 
Defendant’s Memorandum of Points and Authorities in Support of Motion to Dismiss in case 
Case No. 2:17-cv-01241-PSG-SS in Central District Court of California dated February, 27

September 9, 2020


Northern Dynasty  (NAK US)


The $4.7 bln figure is absurd. The number fails to include a key cost that, 
when factored in, sinks even the unrealistically cheap 20-year plan: the 
natural gas pipeline will have to be lengthened from 86 to 164 miles, and 
that increase will cost at least an additional $0.4 bln.8 This and other miss-
ing costs and associated overhead and contingency come to another $1 
billion. Those missing costs conservatively put the 20-year plan’s capital 
costs at $5.7 bln. That sinks the positive NPV of $1 bln that NAK claims 
for the project. 


And NAK’s strawman NPV fails to include reclamation and closure costs, 
which include wastewater treatment for centuries. Those costs we estimate 
at $1.8 bln.  9


The “$7-8 bln” admission shows that management knows it is low balling. 
Kerrisdale Capital published a negative report about Pebble called “Cu at 
Zero” in February 2017 and stated that they had spoken with staff at for-
mer NAK partner AAL, who said that they had estimated the initial capital 
cost of the mine at between $11- $13 bln in 2012 when preparing a feasibil-
ity study that was never published.10 In responding, NAK admitted there 
was such an analysis: 


 “In fact, Pebble Partnership staff, led by secondees from Anglo 
American, recognized the flaws with this work and continued study-
ing development alternatives. Further, a review of a preliminary 
draft US$13 billion mine planning scenario by an independent engi-
neering firm commissioned by Northern Dynasty identified issues 
with that study and identified savings that reduced the preliminary 
capital estimate by US$4 billion.“11


In other words, NAK responded to Kerrisdale by saying costs would be $9 bln, 
or about double what they had claimed in 2011. Seven years and about another 
$0.5 bln later, there is still no update to the capital required to build the mine. 


8  We have used the current pipeline project average cost per inch of $260,000 to estimate 
the construction cost at $511 mln (260,000 x 12 x 164) see below in this section for full 
description.

September 9, 2020


Northern Dynasty  (NAK US)


It is unusual for a development of this scale not to have a proper feasibil-
ity study at this stage. A feasibility study demonstrates in detail whether a 
mine plan for a deposit is economically viable. We have reviewed 870 cop-
per-development projects, of which 59% had either a feasibility or prefeasi-
bility study.12 Why hasn’t NAK done one? Tom Collier, CEO of the operating 
entity, Pebble Partners, told Frontline that the company did not have the 
money to pay for one.13 A feasibility study costs between 0.5% and 1.5%14 
of the capital costs of a mine, which for NAK would be approximately $20 - 
$80 mln. We believe the current cost would be in the lower range, as most 
of the project has working drawings, making costing fairly straightfor-
ward. NAK has spent $1 bln on developing the mine to date. NAK recently 
completed a capital raise of $35.3 mln on July 15, 2020 and did not include 
a feasibility study in the use of funds.15 NAK could easily afford to com-
plete a feasibility study but chooses not to: we think management knows 
the outcome will demonstrate that the mine will not make money.


Mining majors AAL and RIO may have known of the negative return to be 
expected if there is an attempt to mine this deposit, which lies in a fragile 
wetland upstream of a key salmon fishery in Bristol Bay, Alaska. It had to 
be painful for them to walk away from sunk costs of $0.5 billion. 


Only 5% of the deposit is proven to be economically viable (see Appendix 1).16 
The new mine plan will mine 1,300 mln tons, or 12% of the deposit, main-
ly the portion of the deposit that is not proven to be economically viable.17 


12  We reviewed 870 copper development studies over the past 40 years sourced from S&P 
Global of which 411 were unique properties.

16  See response to RFI 070 at https://www.pebbleprojecteis.com/documents/eis where the 
company states it had spent $851 million up to 9/5/2018 and we estimate the company has 
spent approximately $100 mln since that date making total spent on development to date of 
$951 million.


17  The mine cut-off grade for copper is 0.29% and gold is 0.27% g/t lower than the 
economically viable “measured mineral resource” and a strip ratio of 0.11:1 indicates it is the 
portion of the deposit right on the surface. The mine will be low grade ore near the surface 
that is part of the inferred mineral resource which by definition has unknown economic 
viability. https://www.pebbleprojecteis.com/documents/finaleis

Estimates of Initial Capital 
Northern Dynasty reluctantly revealed range is $7-9 bln 


NAK has publicly stated that initial capital costs are estimated 
between $7 and $9 bln. Anglo American estimated $9-$13 bln. No 
surprise NDM has failed to produce a feasibility study after 
decades of work and a billion invested in the project. Capital costs 
of $5.7 bln eliminates the possibility of any return


No Feasibility Study Ever Published

initial capital costs for 
the project

In 2019, as part of the environmental impact statement process, Richard 
Borden, a former senior manager at Rio Tinto, made a series of submissions 
to the USACE that are highly critical of the Pebble mine plan’s economic 
viability.19 The Borden analysis, carried out for mine opponent the Natu-
ral Resources Defense Council, came up with significantly higher capital 
(an extra $1.3 bln) and post-closure costs ($4.5 bln) than the company had 
forecast.20 In response, Pebble’s Tom Collier was irate: “He’s wrong, and 
he didn’t look at a single piece of real information,” Collier said. “The man 
made up assumptions and looked at data from years ago. Update the metals 
to realistic metals prices, and what you find is that it adds 7 billion dollars. 
He made negative assumptions across the board.” Collier said the mine 
under consideration is “night and day” from the 2011 scenario.21

Yet Pebble itself in 2018 relied on its 2011 scenario to argue that the mine 
is economically viable. The USACE asked Pebble for modeling on the eco-
nomic viability of the proposed mine. In response, Pebble provided analysis 
based entirely on the 2011 scenario.22

The gaping holes in the NAK 20-year plan:


 ‣ Pipeline additional costs: $414 mln. NAK’s pipeline estimate remains 
at $98 mln though the pipeline was extended from 86 miles to 164 
miles. We have used the current pipeline project average cost per inch 
of $260,000 to estimate the construction cost at $511 mln (260,000 x 
12 x 164).23 We consider this method conservative, as there are actually 
three pipes over half the length: natural gas, concentrate, and wastewa-
ter. By conservative estimate, the pipeline’s extension adds $414 mln. 


 ‣ Mining costs: $49 mln. The new mine has similar specifications to the 
old. We therefore have added back all of the reduced mining costs. 


 ‣ Molybdenum separation plant: $84 mln. This was removed from the 
cost estimate of Pebble, but the process is still in the mine plan, so 
we added it back.


 ‣ Indirect and contingency cost increase: $420 mln. Additional contin-
gency and indirect costs that flow from the above.

Why the mine will never be extended
Expanding the mine past year 20 would require an exponential increase 
in waste.24 NAK’s own permit application indicates that, following the 20-
year mine, the next 58 years would generate 22.3 bln tons of waste, ap-
proximately 22x the waste by weight of the 20-year mine. Cyanide would 
most likely be used in processing in the expansion. There is no question 
this level of waste will devastate the wetlands, pollute the waterways and 
decimate fish stocks. 


We do not believe such an expansion will ever be permitted. The environ-
mental impact statement for the 20-year plan only squeaked by with the 
support of Republican politicians. A mine extension of just 25 years would 
produce at least eight times more waste and 11 times more toxic waste 
than in the first 20 years. We believe it could be even higher: the first 20 
years plan a strip ratio of 0.11:1, and so the strip ratio of any extension is 


24  See Pebble response to RFI 062 referenced above the waste for the next 58 years 
would be 22.3 bln tons which is approximately 22x the waste of the 20-year mine, Cyanide 
would most likely be used in processing in the expansion. See also https://inletkeeper.

Wastewater Treatment Forever
NAK did not include any mine-closure costs in its NPV analysis in the 
2011 PEA or in estimates submitted to the USAEC. We estimate the 
reclamation and water treatment costs at the time of closure will be $1.78 
bln. That creates a drag on NPV of $0.46 bln. When the mine is closed, 
structures will be demolished, hundreds of millions of tons of waste will 
be moved back into the pit, and wastewater will have to be treated for 
centuries. The power plant, gas pipeline, roads and camps will remain open 
indefinitely to treat the wastewater.

Comparable Mine Projects: Better Value Elsewhere 
Other copper projects under development provide better returns and re-
quire less capital. We reviewed large-scale copper projects (expected to 
produce more than 100,000 metric tonnes of copper per year) currently be-
ing developed to compare with Pebble.25 We included RIO’s Oyu Tolgoi to 
reference a recent project that has been completed. Each one of these proj-
ects has a full feasibility study or prefeasibility study, which means they 
are economically minable. As a rule of thumb, we can see projects have 
an NPV-to-capital ratio of around 1. For each $1 of capital you will get $1 
NPV. We have used Pebble’s own capital costs and NPV and the ratio is 
only 0.2, or for every $1 of capital invested you will get $0.20 of NPV. 


Four of the largest copper mining companies in the world AAL, RIO, Mit-
subishi Corporation (8058 JP) and First Quantum Minerals (FM TO) have

calculated with a discount rate of 7%.

Political Jeopardy2627


We believe even if this new mine plan is approved, the project faces near 
certain cancellation on environmental grounds. Joe Biden could not have 
been more explicit in his view of the mine when he said a few weeks ago: 


“Bristol Bay has been foundational to the way of life of Alaska Na-
tives for countless generations, provides incredible joy for recre-
ational anglers from across the country, and is an economic pow-
erhouse that supplies half of the world’s wild sockeye salmon. It 
is no place for a mine. The Obama-Biden Administration reached 
that conclusion when we ran a rigorous, science-based process in 
2014, and it is still true today. The only reason we are still debating 
whether Pebble Mine should move forward is because hours after

former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt met with a mining execu-
tive behind closed doors, the Trump Administration reversed our 
thoughtful decision. Now, Alaskan culture, traditions, and jobs are 
on the line. As President, I will do what President Trump has failed 
to do: listen to the scientists and experts to protect Bristol Bay — 
and all it offers to Alaska, our country, and the world.”28


Last week, investors got a taste of what is likely to happen if Democrats 
win the White House in November: the stock fell by nearly 45% in a single 
day when Politico reported that the Trump Administration would block the 
project, and Donald Trump Jr. expressed his opposition. That turned out not 
to be true: Politico took a regulatory request for information on environ-
mental mitigation for a plan to block the mine.29 Shares bounced back. 


Both federal and state governments clearly have the power to veto a Pebble 
mine regardless of any approved permits.30 Currently, both are Republican 
governments that strongly support Pebble, but one election could change 
that.
