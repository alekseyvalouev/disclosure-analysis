Background and Business


• Green Mountain Coffee Roasters (GMCR) is 
headquartered in Waterbury, VT


• GMCR was founded in 1981 as a small café in rural 
Vermont where it roasted and served premium coffee


• GMCR soon began distributing coffee to restaurants, 
supermarkets, convenience stores, and specialty 
food stores primarily in the northeastern U.S.

Background and Business


• During the 1990s the majority of GMCR’s revenues 
were derived through its wholesale coffee business 
with the balance coming from retail and catalog sales


• GMCR benefited from the growth in the specialty 
coffee segment of the coffee industry during the 
1990s 


• From 1991 to 2000 GMCR’s revenues grew 25% a 
year


• From 2000 to 2005 growth slowed to 14% a year


Sources: GMCR 10-K for FY 1997, Capital IQ

Background and Business


• In 1998, Keurig, which had developed a single-cup 
brewing machine for the office market, partnered 
with GMCR to manufacture and sell Keurig’s 
patented K-cups


• Keurig introduced its single-cup brewing system to 
home users in 2002. During that same year GMCR 
acquired 42% of Keurig for $15M


• GMCR acquired the remainder of Keurig in June 
2006 for $104M


Sources: GMCR 10-K for FY 2006; GMCR 8-K filed on May 22, 2006; GMCR 10-K for FY 2002

Background and Business


• Since the Keurig acquisition in 2006:
 GMCR business evolved to a razor / razor blade model


• Sell the brewer (razor) at or near cost


• Sell the K-cup (razor blade) at a high margin


 GMCR grew Keurig through direct sales and by license agreements 
with Tully’s, Timothy’s, Diedrich and Van Houtte


 GMCR revenues have grown at a 57% CAGR from 2006 to 2010


 GMCR has sold over 13 million single-serve brewers and over 9 billion 
K-cups


• Approximately 96% of Keurig brewers shipped in fiscal 2010 were sold to 
the At-Home channel

Bull Case
15


Bull Case


• The GMCR growth story is still in the early innings
 There are 64 million households that drink 2+ cups each 


day


 If GMCR captures 1/3 of that market = 21 million brewer 
installed base


 Current installed base is 7.5 million (as of May 2011), 
therefore the installed base could nearly triple from here 


Source: SunTrust Robinson Humphrey research note published May 6, 2011
16


Bull Case


• GMCR still has room to expand distribution
 Retailers will commit additional space to brewers and        


K-cups going forward


• GMCR will experience margin expansion
 Additional infrastructure spend in 2012 will be key to 


greater K-cup profitability


• The installed base of brewers will increase from 
having recognized brands like Starbucks and Dunkin 
Donuts available in the Keurig system
 Partnerships mitigate competition risk

Bull Case


• GMCR is currently capacity constrained:
 “We are definitely being stretched…. demand is definitely 


stretching our ability to supply. And we've not quite caught 
up with that demand curve yet.” (1)


 “As we have continued to add portion pack production 
capacity in Q3, we were able to fulfill customer demand that 
had pent-up in the system over the prior two quarters.” (2)


 “We continued to also experience spot outages of portion 
packs with our customers.” (2)

19


Bull Case


• GMCR claims to be a technology company
 “We are a technology company with a host of patents” (1)


 “I would define our company today as really a single serve 
beverage company that is sitting on top of this magnificent 
technology, call it disruptive technology platform” (2)


• Jim Cramer called GMCR an “ETF on the rapid-
growing single-serve market” (3)


• “We are the iPod of coffee” (4)

Market Opportunity


• The opportunity is smaller than the bulls believe
 The addressable market is smaller


 The penetration is greater
• Estimated installed base of >10.5M household brewers (1)


• 20,000 retail points of distribution (2)


• 15,200 supermarket points of distribution (2)


 The attachment rate, or estimated daily K-cup 
consumption per brewer, is smaller and declining


1. Greenlight estimate through June 30, 2011
2. GMCR presentation given at conference on August 10, 2011 (data as of June 2011)
23


Market Opportunity


• Keurig already has widespread distribution and 
brand awareness 


• GMCR claims the addressable market is the 90 
million households that own a coffee maker (1)


• However, only about 70% of the addressable 
market are regular coffee drinkers (2)


• Keurig is an aspirational product priced above the 
premium end of the market


1. GMCR presentation given at conference on August 10, 2011
2. GMCR presentation given at conference on August 11, 2010 (64M households drink 2+ cups of coffee per day of the 90M with a coffee maker)

GMCR CEO on K-cup Attachment Rate


Q: Have you noticed any change in the attachment rates 
going up, down or are they remaining somewhat stable?


A: I think what we've indicated going forward because we are really 
focused on driving dollars going forward and we will continue to see 
new beverages at new price points. And we are just think that looking 
at dollars sold at portion packs is the best way to look at our overall 
progress. And we are not going to, going forward, report on 
consumption per brewer. Again, we are trying to encourage also 
multiple brewers in every household. We would love for households to 
have a brewer in the kitchen, a brewer in the office, a brewer in their 
weekend getaway whether it is a houseboat or a cottage. And our 
objective here is overall share of household coffee and more broadly, 
non-carbonated beverage consumption. And the brewer consumption 
per brewer is not particularly important, it is the overall portion packs 
sales and our share of household that we're focused on.

5. Smucker’s commented on 2/17/2011 that K-cup margins were above SJM overall margins of ~16%, but not above coffee segment margins of ~29%
6. Greenlight estimates this manufacturing fee based on Smucker’s commentary related to its K-cup operating margin range.  In addition, the $0.06 fee is 


consistent with prior royalty payments received by Keurig from licensees manufacturing K-cups.

Starbucks Deal Structure


• GMCR has said it is indifferent if SBUX or GMCR 
sells the K-cups (1)


• GMCR has said the SBUX deal is most like the 
Smucker’s deal (1)


• SBUX should make the majority (~ 2/3) of the profits


• Smucker’s and SBUX deals should be less profitable 
than GMCR current brands on a per K-cup basis 


• Smucker’s and SBUX deals aren’t entirely 
incremental
 They could cannibalize existing higher margin K-cup sales

Business Quality 


• Historical and intermediate-term cash flow is

• Return on capital even in a bull scenario is 
merely adequate


• It is difficult to justify current super-premium 
multiple (36x FY2012 EPS estimates)
43


Competition and Patents
44


Competition – Bull Case 


• Competition is limited and K-cup patent cliff is not meaningful
 The growth of the Keurig brewer installed base should continue as 


there is a diminishing competitive threat from Tassimo, Senseo, and 
Nestle (1)(2)


 The only meaningful coffee brands that GMCR does not have in its
portfolio are Maxwell House (i.e., Kraft) and Peet’s (3)


 Private label represents only 10% of coffee sold at retail (4)


 There are barriers to entry:
• There is a significant technology and capital requirement to produce K-cups 


on a large scale (4)


• New entrants will have a difficult time securing shelf space in FY ’13 (after 
K-cup patents expire) (1)

The Patent Issue


• GMCR’s Razor/Razor Blade Model depends 
on making high margin profits from selling K-
cups


• At issue: the pending expiration of the key 
patents preventing others from selling K-cups 
for use in Keurig machines
46


Patent Discussion


What GMCR Says In SEC Filings What GMCR Tells Analysts


The two principal patents 
associated with our current 
generation K-cup portion packs 
will expire in 2012, and we have 
pending patent applications 
associated with this technology 
which, if ultimately issued as 
patents, would have expiration 
dates extending to 2023. (1)


1. GMCR 10-K for FY2010, p.10
2. GMCR CEO Larry Blanford, Q3 2011 conference call on July 27, 2011


Q: Clearly the patents roll off in a 
year, and there might be some 
kind of me-too type products out. 
How do you see that evolving?


A: With respect to our patents 
and intellectual property, we 
have a broad portfolio of patents 
on portion packs, on brewers, on 
the system of the – of both 
portion packs and brewers. And 
certainly to the extent that any 
other product might infringe on 
our intellectual property, we take 
that very seriously and we would, 
in fact, rigorously defend our 
intellectual property. (2)
47


The Reality of GMCR’s Patent Position


• GMCR wants everyone to believe 
that the patent situation is under 
control


• However… GMCR will no longer be 
able to rely on the two patents after 
September 16, 2012
 Competitors will be able to produce   


K-cups
48


Competition Expected In September 2012


• Both patents (patent 5,325,765 and patent 
5,840,189) are set to expire


• Any aspect of the K-cup that was revealed in either 
patent falls into the public domain 


• Competitors will also be free to develop their own 
improved versions of the K-cup, taking the core 
concept from these patents but then altering, for 
instance, the design of the filter or the materials 
used to make the cup itself


• Competitors will also be able to advertise their        
K-cups as being compatible with the Keurig system 


Source: Professor of Law.
49


The Patent Issue


• GMCR has been aware of the looming patent 
problem for years


• We believe it has embarked on a multi-pronged 
strategy to attempt to maintain its position
 Overpay to buy their licensees back via acquisitions


 Partner with other coffee brands


 Attempt to patent minor improvements to the K-cup


 Introduce a new brewer that uses a different patented 
portion pack.

allocation of the Van Houtte purchase price to 
goodwill to $472.3 million
 A re-estimation of $53.7 million


Sources: GMCR 10-Q for Q1 2011 and GMCR 10-Q for Q2 2011
53


Summary of Acquisitions


• GMCR eliminated the licensees by buying them


• The most valuable asset the companies had was the license 
to make K-cups


• The licenses had limited value, as they would not be needed 
after the GMCR patents expire


• GMCR paid high prices to avoid having to compete with 
licensees post patent expiration


• The licensees roasted coffee and packaged their own          
K-cups, so they should have had similar fixed investment to 
GMCR


• The very high allocations to Goodwill raise suspicion about 
subsequent earnings quality
54


Brand Partnering


• To mitigate the threat of competition GMCR has 
partnered with multiple brands


• GMCR has, in effect, attempted to transition itself 
into the low-cost manufacturer of K-cups, which 
makes it a manufacturing company rather than a 
technology company
55


Brand Partnering


• Brand partnering could cannibalize higher 
profit GMCR K-cup sales with lower profit 
brand partner K-cup sales


• Contract manufacturing is a capital intensive, 
low multiple business


• Still does not prevent K-cup competition post 
patent expiration
56


The Patent Issue


• GMCR is attempting to patent minor improvements to their 
K-cup, unsuccessfully so far
 Fluted filter vs. the original filter with smooth sides and conical shape


• The Patent Office rejected this patent application because of 
“obviousness”


• GMCR recently had this sent back to the Patent Office.  GMCR will likely 
spend 3-12 months defending this long-pending patent application.


 Even if GMCR does succeed here, it is irrelevant because anybody
can make a K-cup for the installed base of Keurig brewers after 
September 2012


 GMCR would need to convince their customers that a fluted K-cup 
filter makes a better cup of coffee than a smooth K-cup filter


Source: Professor of Law.
57


Next Generation Brewer?
• GMCR is attempting to 


introduce a new brewer that 
uses a different, patented    
K-cup
 The new brewer appears to be 


higher end and is not meant to 
replace the current installed 
base (1)


 On December 17, 2010, Keurig 
filed a new patent application 
that discloses a way to use 
“sonic energy” to drive and 
control the brewing process (2)


 The next generation brewer 
clearly uses a different K-cup; in 
this example it would require a 
sonic receiver (2)


 This may or may not be their 
next generation brewer

2. US Patent Application filed December 17, 2010
58


Patent Issue – New Brewer Platform


• GMCR hinted it would replace the brewer ecosystem 
 “As we are thinking about the future and the new platform, 


we are envisioning that the new platform would exist for 
some time with our current platform.” (1)


 “If you want to come into the system, how comfortable are 
you investing in your R&D, CapEx, go to market and that 
might eventually be obsolete?” (2)


1. Larry Blanford, CEO on Q1 2011 earnings call dated February 2, 2011
2. Fran Rathke, CFO at conference on March 15, 2011
59


Patent Issue – New Brewer Platform


• GMCR recently changed directions: 
 While the company remained tight lipped on the 


specifics of the next gen platform, it does see it as a 
parallel platform, not a replacement for the “classic”
version. We expect the product to be focused on the 
high end of the market with limited distribution for the 
next year or two. (1)


• The goal of the new system is to have a new 
portion pack that would extend patent protection 
until 2021


1. SunTrust Robinson Humphrey research note published September 13, 2011
60


Problems With New Brewer Platform Plan


• Why would a consumer abandon the soon-to-be 
open Keurig platform to “upgrade” to a new closed 
platform that offers less product choice and enforces 
GMCR’s monopoly pricing?


• Offering a new brewer system with new portion 
packs invites the consumer to consider competitive 
products


• “Launching a new incompatible brewer system 
would be a significant risk for the company.” (1)


1.  Professor of Law.
61


Patent Issue


• Conclusion:


This is a Razor / Razor Blade Model 
where GMCR will lose its ability to 
monopoly price its razor blade next 
September
62


Private Label Competition


• Major retailers want private label K-cups 


• Kroger, Safeway, Super Value, HEB, Wegman’s and 
Costco have indicated they would be interested, as 
soon as a private label manufacturer can produce a  
K-cup with a filter 


• Sturm (Treehouse) can enter the market with minimal 
capital investment
 Sturm already produces filter-less K-cups


 Sturm has production lines that can be easily modified


Source: Private label food & beverage industry expert
63


Private Label Competition


Private label K-cup penetration could exceed private 
label coffee penetration today because of the price 
differential
 “The penetration level in private brands of the entire coffee 


business is between 10 and 11%. It’s been staying about 
there. But Sturm feels that the potential penetration level of 
single serve coffee is so much greater than it is for the 
standard business because the price differentials are going 
to be huge.”


 “I would say that a 20% penetration level would not be a 
bad number.”

• Capital spending is growing much faster than

• Capital intensity should be getting more

• The gap is so large and insufficiently

Revenues in June 2011 Quarter


• GMCR CFO stated that management was “surprised to the 
upside on the strength of the portion pack (K-cup) sales.” (1)


• GMCR ascribed the $100 million revenue outperformance to a 
combination of four factors (1)


 Continued strong consumer adoption of the Keurig Single-Cup Brewing 
system coming off a holiday season


 Higher advertising and retail merchandising 


 Catch-up from prior periods (i.e., more K-cups sold in the June quarter 
as a result of adding additional capacity and filling pent-up customer 
demand from December and March quarters)


 Pull-forward from future periods (i.e., more K-cups sold in the June 
quarter as a result of retailers purchasing K-cups in advance of a K-cup 
price increase that took effect at the end of the June quarter)

SEC Inquiry


• On September 20, 2010, the staff of the SEC’s 
Division of Enforcement informed the Company that it 
was conducting an inquiry and made a request for a 
voluntary production of documents and information


• Based on the request, the Company believes the 
focus of the inquiry concerns certain revenue 
recognition practices and the Company’s relationship 
with one of its fulfillment vendors


• The Company, at the direction of the audit committee 
of the Company’s board of directors, is cooperating 
fully with the SEC staff’s inquiry

SEC Correspondence


• SEC asked GMCR to file MBlock agreement
 We note your disclosure regarding the importance of your 


relationship with MBlock & Sons, Inc., the order fulfillment 
entity through which the company makes a majority of the 
at-home orders for the Keurig business unit’s single-cup 
business sold to retailers. Please tell us how you 
concluded that filing your contract documentation would 
not be required to comply with Item 601(b)(10) of 
Regulation S-K. The same comment applies to your 
single order fulfillment partner in Canada and your sole 
manufacturer in China.


Source: SEC letter to GMCR dated March 2, 2011 “Comment 9.” Emphasis added.
87


GMCR’s Response
• In analyzing its contractual relationships with third parties, the 


Company has evaluated its contracts with each of its 
fulfillment partners and its manufacturer in China and 
concluded that such contracts are not material for purposes 
of Item 601 of Regulation S-K.


• As disclosed in the Fiscal 2010 Form 10-K, MBlock performs 
an administrative function in processing the majority of sales 
orders for the Company’s at-home single-cup business with 
retailers in the United States. 


• These fulfillment entities do not sell the Company’s products 
but rather receive and fulfill sales orders and invoice retailers 
and maintain the Company’s inventory. The Company notes 
that even though approximately 43% of its consolidated net 
sales were processed by MBlock in fiscal 2010, the 
substance of MBlock’s relationship with the Company is 
administrative and procedural and not as a purchaser or 
consumer of the Company’s products.

What GMCR Said in 2009


• We rely on a single order fulfillment company, MBlock & 
Sons, Inc., to process the majority of orders for our At-Home 
(AH) single-cup business sold through retailers. We sell a 
significant number of brewers and K-cups to this third party 
fulfillment company for re-sale to certain retailers.


• Receivables from this company were approximately 51% of 
our consolidated accounts receivable balance at September 
26, 2009. Accordingly, we are subject to significant credit risk
regarding the creditworthiness of this company. (1)


• Revenue from wholesale and consumer direct sales is 
recognized upon product delivery, and in some cases upon 
product shipment. (2)

SEC Inquiry


• MBlock remains very material to GMCR


• GMCR is by far MBlock’s biggest relationship


• MBlock former workers felt like they worked for Keurig
 “It was more like I was working for Keurig than I was working for


MBlock… I really never even had a boss while I was at MBlock.”


• Nature of the “unusual” relationship
 When Keurig came to visit MBlock, “they were not treated like clients 


as the other customers were…. It was so weird.”


 “They treated all the other customers like clients.  Not Keurig.”


• SEC is right to demand disclosure of the material agreement 
between the two companies

Results of Field Research
91


Field Interviews - Background
• It was difficult to understand how GMCR sold the extra $100 


million of K-cups in the June 2011 Quarter
• It was alleged in a class action lawsuit filed earlier this year (1):


 “CW1 [Confidential Witness One] indicated that GMCR improperly 
recognized revenue on 150 truck loads of product that was shipped to 
MBlock during the quarter ended December 26, 2009. This former 
GMCR manager stated that he/she and other Company employees, 
including the Company's global transportation manager, were unable to 
locate the requisite paperwork, including purchase orders, material 
requisition orders, or product shipment authorizations, traditionally used 
by GMCR to validate the sale.


 Specifically, CW1 indicated that because there was no order for those 
products, no payment was ever made on the 150-truckload shipment. In 
addition, the order was not listed on the Company's production forecast 
schedule and employees who worked under CW1 not only saw the 
trucks go out, but visited MBlock and saw its warehouses filled to the 
rafters with K-cups. CW1, who estimated that the value the revenue 
recognized on the foregoing improperly recorded transaction to be  
between $7.5 and $15 million dollars…”


1. Horowitz v. Green Mountain Coffee Roasters 7/12/11 (p.19)
92


Field Interviews - Background


• In an effort to determine whether the recent strong 
results were driven by similar behavior, we 
interviewed several former GMCR and MBlock 
workers


• The workers tell consistent stories and paint an 
unflattering picture of the companies


• The research shows that Green Mountain and 
MBlock are potentially engaged in a variety of 
shenanigans that appear designed to mislead 
auditors and to inflate financial results
93


Field Interviews – Summary Findings


• Both GMCR and MBlock use sub-standard IT systems.  
Important functions including inventory management are 
performed in Excel spreadsheets which are easy to change, 
provide non-standardized analysis, and are prone to material 
error.


• Suggestions to improve operations through the use of 
technology are met with resistance inside both organizations


• The Accounting Department at GMCR uses many temporary 
workers and makes extensive use of college “co-op” students 
instead of hiring full time accountants


• Former workers believe that though no reason was given, 
they were fired for asking too many questions
94


Field Interviews – Summary Findings


• Bonuses were based on overall K-cup production, rather 
than on total revenue/sales
 This has led to excess production and related inventory and spoilage 


problems


• There is a lot of cross-shipping. Product is transferred from 
one facility to another, often multiple times
 PeopleSoft function to fulfill orders from multiple locations was never 


implemented


 Deliberate overproduction of K-cups and refusal to ship from multiple 
locations gave cover for a “shell game that Green Mountain was 
playing across all its facilities.”


 “We would do more transferring of inventory than we physically did 
shipping… Keurig would ship stuff to themselves, I mean truckloads 
of stuff they’d ship [from MBlock] to themselves.”


Sources:  Former GMCR / MBlock  workers
95


Field Interviews – Summary Findings


• Peculiar relationship between GMCR and its 
distributors
 “It was clear that Keurig and Green Mountain control 


MBlock.”


 “Nobody in that warehouse can tell you what is MBlock’s, 
what is Keurig, what is Green Mountain’s, nobody can tell 
you that.  I honestly don’t think the owner of MBlock can 
tell you that.”


• Odd material movements at distributors
 Kenco trucker allegedly reported delivering merchandise 


to Kenco, picking it up later on, sealing the truck, and 
delivering it 10 bay doors down at the same warehouse


Sources:  Former GMCR / MBlock  workers
96


Field Interviews – Summary Findings


• Excess production…
 “… he was the manager of demand planning. And consistently, his     


e-mails would talk about how far over the demand forecast actual 
production was.”


• Led to a significant problem with expired coffee
 MBlock received truckloads of expired coffee directly from Green


Mountain


 Channel checks have identified significant amounts of retail product 
with short shelf-life, and at times even expired product


 “These plant managers just kept on saying they have space taken up 
by the inordinate amount of expired coffee.”


 “I would have to say at least one third of their warehouse is more than 
likely expired coffee in all the warehouses.”


Sources:  Former GMCR / MBlock  workers; Greenlight channel checks
97


Field Interviews – In Their Own Words


• Irregularities during external inventory audits at 
MBlock
 Prior to the inventory audit, “We would remove product and 


preload trailer trucks to ship to retailers because we didn’t have 
room on the floor.  Then we’d load more product on trailer 
trucks to nowhere to move it off the floor.”


 The warehouse was partially cleared prior to an audit, leaving a
skeleton inventory of ~50%.  Inventory was loaded onto trucks, 
which sat in the docks and was never counted.  Sometimes 
after the audit, the product would simply be moved back into the
warehouse.


 Immediately prior to an audit, 500,000 brewers were inventoried 
and processed as an order for QVC.  The brewers were never 
shipped, and after the audit, the inventory was restocked.

Putting It All Together

Putting It All Together


• GMCR has grown rapidly


• The market is smaller and more penetrated


• Legitimate growth is already slowing


• Attachment rates matter and they are falling


• A more realistic assessment of potential earnings is 
closer to $3.50 than $9.00 and at that point GMCR 
should garner a market multiple rather than a 
premium valuation

• Margins expanded dramatically as Van Houtte 
“just spen[t] less than we thought”


• GMCR sold 1.3 million brewers, which 
exceeded market expectations by about 
300,000 brewers (1)

worker described the 500,000 brewers that 
were not to be inventoried

Putting It All Together


• Management clearly stated that they did not pull forward any 
sales
 Q: Just want to make sure I understand, not the seasonality but whether, how 


much sales actually might have been pulled forward in response to the spring 
merchandising.  I think on brewer sales it looked like the NPD data was 
running at about a plus-60% or so rate, and I think your brewers sales in the 
quarter were up over 80? 


 A: First of all one of the things to be cautious about is the NPD database does 
not reflect all of our customers. In fact several of our customers are not 
included in that base so you can't really make those direct comparisons from 
one base to the other. We did not pull forward any sales at all…. I think that is 
just the nature of the acceleration of adoption of the product is really with what 
we are seeing, there is no pulling forward of shipments to do anything, other 
than react to the demand (1)

• Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
 Under the supervision of and with the participation of 


management, including the Company’s Chief Executive 
Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Company 
conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design 
and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, 
as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) of the 
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, as of 
March 26, 2011. Based on that evaluation and the material 
weaknesses referenced above, the Chief Executive Officer 
and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the 
Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not 
effective as of March 26, 2011.
