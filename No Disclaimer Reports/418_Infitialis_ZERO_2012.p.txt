ZERO's Current Scheme Is Nearly Identical To The Program That Led
To An SEC Halt And Fraud Charges In 2001
Sep. 25, 2012 8:40 AM ET46 comments
by: Infitialis


Since publishing our first report on August 8, 2012, our public track record of exposing
alleged fraud or folly has recorded 5 out of 5 wins with the most recent OTC:CLSR
declining by as much as 56% yesterday less than 24 hours after our expose was
published. And while readers will not be able to verify this independently we had prepared
our second NASDAQ report on PPHM which was due to be published this week only,
shares of the company dropped by 76% yesterday making our report obsolete.


The purpose of this opening rant is to communicate to our readers that when we publish a
report on a company, we have generally spent hours upon hours poring through the
regulatory filings as well as conducting background checks on nearly everyone involved
with the enterprise. We view our track record as merely a testament to the fact that the
information we uncover is so material to the investment making process that it causes an
imminent revaluation of the share price.


History Repeating


Today's report may provide some of our readers with a surreal case of Déjà vu in what is
yet another unique OTCBB experience. We have uncovered a company trading at a $242
million valuation that not only has zero revenues, just $59,892 in cash, and $3.6 million in
negative shareholder equity (liabilities that exceed assets) but was sued in 2001 by the
SEC for engaging in exactly the same type of promotion that we believe has led naïve
investors to purchase the shares en masse contributing to a 300% gain in the share price
in less than 10 days. Investors and their short memories have apparently forgotten how to
use the handy SEC website as anybody could find the well documented case of
management hyping shares with dreams of a new technology that would revolutionize a
multi-billion dollar industry. We believe the case to be so identical that we have decided to
write the report in a format that places the SEC case on the left and the current promotion
on the right highlighting the similarities in the most efficient manner. This is the story of
Save The World Technologies, Inc. (ZERO.OB)

Readers can decide whether this is an R&D Facility for a quarter billion dollar company or
an AAMCO Tune Up Shop.


Side by Side Comparison of 2001 SEC Case against ZERO and the Current Efforts
to Manipulate the Share Price


From the December 2001 SEC Litigation Against


ZERO and it's then CEO Jeffrey Muller


The 2012 ZERO Stock Promotion


10. STWA is a Nevada corporation. At all relevant times,


its principal offices in the United States were located at


1285 Avenue of the Americas in New York, New York.


STWA's common stock is registered with the Commission


under Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Until July 20,


2000, STWA stock was quoted on the over-the-counter


bulletin board ("OTCBB") under the ticker symbol ZERO.


On July 20, 2000, the Commission temporarily


suspended trading of STWA securities. STWA's stock


currently is quoted on the "pink sheets."


Nearly everything has remained the


same:


Still incorporated in Nevada


Still trading under the symbol ZERO


Still called "Save The World"


Same website at:


http://www.stwa.com/


Has yet to be Halted


Nearly everything is the same in the


company's current description of its


business on its most recently filed 10Q,


note the company provides ZERO


disclosure of its well documented SEC


case from 2001.

1. From at least February 23, 1999 through at least April


17, 2001, Defendants STWA and Muller, STWA's


former chief executive officer and president, engaged


in a fraudulent scheme to manipulate the market for


stock in STWA, a public company. STWA and Muller


used press releases, Internet postings, an elaborate


Internet website, and televised media events to


disseminate false and materially misleading


information about STWA's product and commercial


prospects. STWA's and Muller's actions artificially


inflated the price and trading volume of STWA stock,


causing its market capitalization to be as much as


$218,728,062.


Since January of 2012 ZERO has


distributed no less than 27 press


releases, while building an elaborate


website filled with media events, product


presentations, and even an investor


newsletter which have led shares of


ZERO to increase by over 300%. This


while an invisible hand has been buying


and selling shares of ZERO using a


relatively unknown broker dealer in


Texas named Tejas Securities. In both


July and August of 2012 Tejas had the


highest reported volume (non retail) in


shares of ZERO. Together these actions


have manipulated investors into buying


shares of ZERO at artificially inflated


prices causing the market capitalization


to rise to $242,791,135 even though


the company has just $59,892 in


cash, less than $200,000 in assets,


and over $3.6 million in liabilities.

2. STWA's business purportedly involves the


manufacture, licensing, and distribution of a device for


motor vehicles called the "Zero Emission Fuel Saver"


("ZEFS"). Arranged by Muller, STWA engaged in a


promotional media campaign to generate interest in


STWA and the ZEFS. The promotional information


distributed by STWA falls generally into two


categories: (A) announcements of significant


licensing agreements and other important business


developments; and (B) announcements concerning


public automotive demonstrations that purportedly


proved or would prove that the ZEFS materially


reduces emissions and improves fuel economy in


motor vehicles. The foregoing representations by


STWA were false and misleading and were made


without reasonable basis in fact. The purported


licensing agreements and other purported business


events simply did not exist, and the ZEFS


demonstrations did not prove that the ZEFS actually


worked as represented.


Directly from the June 30th, 2012 10Q:


STWA's business now purportedly


involves the design, licensing and


development of products that reduce


operational costs for oil pipelines.


Specifically the AOT technology which


reduces the viscosity of crude oil,


thereby making it less restrictive to


pipeline transport. The promotional


information distributed by STWA falls


generally into two categories:


announcements of significant licensing


agreements and other important


business developments; and


announcements concerning public


demonstrations that purportedly proved


or would prove that the AOT technology


materially reduces the viscosity of oil


allowing with its beer budget balance


sheet to challenge the laws of physics


and innovate in the $100 Billion+ R&D


Energy industry.

3. Blackwelder prepared and arranged to have issued at


least one false press release announcing a major


licensing deal. That transaction did not exist. Blackwelder


also posted positive messages about STWA on an


Internet stock message board without disclosing, as


required, that he received shares of STWA as payment


for the promotion. Blackwelder's postings were materially


misleading because they created the impression that


Blackwelder was expressing unbiased views about


STWA and its stock, when he was actually a paid


promoter.


Only the SEC can figure this out by


using their subpoena power. In the


mean time we uncovered a press


release from March 2012 that we


believe to be exaggerated at best and


possibly a complete fabrication. In the


way ZERO issues the press release


they make LG Partners sound as though


they are a large enterprise developing a


$2.5 Billion pipeline. We searched


vigorously and found no proof of LG


Partners other than as a DBA for an


individual named Michael Leader in


Atlanta Georgia. The address used on


the purported contract that warranted


such a promotional press release is


none other than Michael Leader's 1,355


square foot home in Atlanta valued by


Zillow at $212,000. There is no way this


company is developing any billion dollar


pipelines anytime soon.


4. On February 23, 1999, STWA issued a press release


announcing the sale of the ZEFS device to Pancorp


Australia Pty. Ltd. ("Pancorp"). STWA reported that it had


"received a 5% cash deposit for the $2.5 million


(Australian dollars) sale." The announcement further


quoted Muller as stating, "[w]e believe that our estimated


revenue projections of 20 cents per share for the first


quarter can now be achieved


If in 1999 the cornerstone of the


promotion was a heavily promoted


contract with an Australian company in


2012 ZERO has changed the script a


little bit by hyping a purported


relationship with a Chinese company.


Here is our problem with this whole


purported relationship:


1. There is not one indication of proof


on the internet that "Beijing Heng He


Xing Ye Technology Consulting" has


ever existed prior to it being


mentioned as a partner by ZERO.


This claim can be independently

verified by any reader by simply


searching Google for the company


and going through EVERY page of


results (as we have done). You will


not find one example of the


company existing outside of


news releases issued by ZERO.


2. The entire Petrochina relationship


appears to be exaggerated with our


belief that ZERO simply paid a


consultant to have their prototype


tested at the Petrochina R&D lab


something that anyone can pay to


do.


3. This is no different from the overly


hyped "tests" that ZERO paid for


through the Pipeline Research


Council. Both the test with the


RMOTC and the one with Temple


University were self funded and self


prepared by ZERO with the results


highly exaggerated as we will


explain in the next section. As the


Pipeline Research Council states on


its OWN website "The majority of


funding for PRCI's research


programs comes from the pipeline


industry through the annual


subscriptions of member


companies. In addition to the


allocation by members of their


subscriptions, members may also


contribute supplemental funding


to programs they determine


worthy of commitment. In this


case a program that can add over


$200 million dollars in value to your

https://seekingalpha.com/article/887041-zeros-current-scheme-is-nearly-identical-to-the-program-that-led-to-an-sec-halt-and-fraud-charges-in-2001 8/


stock is obviously "worthy" of a test.


Especially when you are using your


shareholders money to pay for it.


25. STWA's representations concerning the success of its


ZEFS demonstrations were false and misleading, were


made without reasonable basis in fact, and omitted


material facts necessary to make the statements made


not misleading. In fact, STWA's demonstrations of the


ZEFS device did not prove that the ZEFS device would


actually perform as represented and the press releases


omitted material facts concerning the demonstrations.


For example, the demonstrations were performed on old


cars equipped with carburetors, not on late model cars,


virtually all of which are equipped with fuel injection. The


demonstrations were also "static" tests, performed on


cars in neutral gear without their wheels moving, not on


cars in actual operation on the road. During the Los


Angeles demonstration, discussed in the June 15, 2000


press release, the carbon monoxide reading decreased


only after a mechanic adjusted the car's carburetor.


STWA did not demonstrate that the purported results


were the result of the ZEFS device and not the result of


the carburetor adjustment. During the Los Angeles


demonstration, after connecting the ZEFS device, the


emission of harmful nitric oxide actually increased.


Here the SEC will need to use its


subpoena power to confirm if in fact the


tests were fraudulent. We believe the


tests are clearly misleading for the


following reasons:


1. All "Tests" were self funded by


ZERO


2. The Chinese tests were merely


certifications and not actual


feasibility tests. In reality anybody


with a prototype could pay these


labs to complete these tests on their


products.


3. The RMOTC test was overly hyped


with examples of unnecessary


promotion such as placing stickers


on the oil silos behind the prototype:


4. The entire RMOTC test lasted only


24 hours!


5. During the entire time no variations


of temperature were administered to


the prototype highlighting what is in


our view an unreasonable if not


flawed scientific method underlying


the test.

27. Early in 2000, Muller directed Blackwelder and others


to post numerous messages touting STWA stock on the


Raging Bull Internet message board dedicated to STWA


stock. Muller told Blackwelder and others to use different


aliases and different computers when they posted


messages touting the stock. Muller did this in order to


create the false impression that many people were


talking positively about STWA and its stock.


Once again the SEC will have to use its


subpoena power here to verify whether


the ZERO clan is once again at it on the


message boards. From what we have


observed on the investors hub board


there is definitely some highly


promotional activity orchestrated by a


few posters such as this one that have


post histories comprised only of bullish


ZERO comments.


29. In these posts, Blackwelder did not disclose that


STWA gave him 14,000 shares of STWA stock in


compensation for his promotional services. In some


instances, Blackwelder affirmatively concealed his


identity as the author of the posts.


Looks like ZERO didn't learn from its


past experiences with paying stock touts


shares as compensation. The website


pumpsanddumps.com has disclosed


that ZERO paid a pennystock promoter


nearly 60,000 shares to send out


promotional emails on the company. The


company hired is called: stockguru.com


30. From September 1999 through December 2000,


Muller sold nearly all of his five million restricted shares in


private, unreported transactions. Some of Muller's sales


were to United States citizens. If sold at the then-


prevailing market price, Muller would have realized nearly


$9 million from the sales.


Only 4 days ago! Cecil Kyte, the CEO of


ZERO purchased 500,000 shares of


ZERO currently worth $1.89 a share for


$.25 a share. While retail investors are


paying nearly two bucks, Cecil can sell


into them for a handsome profit!


This exercise has merely confirmed that there are too many similarities between the
current ZERO promotion and the one the SEC sued the company for in 2001. We are
always surprised to see just how dishonest some of these OTCBB scammers are. With
ZERO, we have not been let down as the patterns appear to be nearly identical with the
objective being to liquidate cheap stock at artificial prices.


Different Decade Different Story


Note two screenshots from the ZERO website with one from today and one from 2007. We
remind investors that in 2007 ZERO had the SAME Chairman, Mr. Cecil Bond Kyte:

Screenshot from ZERO's website today. From badmouthing fossil fuels


and promoting the prevention of global warming in 2007, to


badmouthing alternative energies while promoting oil in 2012.


ZERO's "Technology" Is Hardly Proprietary With Past Examples Consisting of
Bankrupt OTCBB Companies


Investors may remember Sulphco Inc. a Texas based OTCBB Company that is currently
bankrupt and trading under the symbol (OTC:SLPHQ). Before it filed for bankruptcy in
2011, Sulphco was a higher flier reaching a valuation of as much as $400 million in 2007.
The demise of the company came when promises to change the physical characteristics
of crude oil by electrifying the crude using a process they called "Sonocracking" eventually
turned out to be a sham. Today shares of Sulphco trade at $.0006 per share.


Conclusion


The bottom line is that investors need to realize that a company with nearly no cash and
assets that total only $200,000 has a ZERO chance of innovating in an energy industry
that sees over $100B expended by the best and brightest scientists and engineers the
world has to offer. The true purpose of this entire production is to sell worthless shares at
artificially inflated prices to unsuspecting investors.


Even the most naïve of retail investors should find it a little unnerving that nearly 10 years
ago this same exact company was sued by the SEC for engaging in nearly an identical
fraud that left investors with nearly $200 million in losses.


We urge investors to stay away from ZERO as we predict that the shares will follow the
path of all five of our recently profiled companies which experienced an average decline of
nearly 60% from the time our report was published. And for those investors that are still
skeptical we urge you to please read the SEC case vs. ZERO in its entirety as we are
certain it will change your minds.
