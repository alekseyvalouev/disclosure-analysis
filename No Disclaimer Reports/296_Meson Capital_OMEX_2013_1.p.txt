Odyssey Marine Exploration Co (OMEX):  


Do Investors Know What Lies Beneath the Surface? 


Executive Summary for OMEX Investigative Report       October 31, 2013 


Target Price: $0.00 Thesis: Strong Sell 


Market Cap: $230mm     (80mm x $2.84/sh) Shareholder’s Equity: ($5.6mm) 


Total Cash: $10mm1  Total Debt: $20mm2 


Net Loss 2012 – 2008, respectively: ($18.2mm); ($16.2mm); ($23.3mm); ($18.6mm); ($24.8mm) 


1) Unclear how much of this cash resides in the US, OMEX formed offshore subsidiaries in 2013 
2) As of June 30, 2013, over $5.3mm of this debt is convertible with a “death spiral” conversion 


feature that allows for the payments to be converted to stock at a 15% discount to market 





“Our talented people, global presence, financial strength and massive market knowledge have created 


our sustainable and unique businesses.  [Our new business models] will accelerate their growth.  We plan 


to leverage all of these competitive advantages to create significant value for our shareholders.” 


  -Enron’s 2000 (Final) Letter to shareholders, published 7 months before bankruptcy 





OMEX was founded by and is currently run by expert stock promoters who have been sued by the SEC.  


 Greg Stemm and John Morris’s previous shipwreck hunting company Seahawk (SHWK: $0.0012) 


was sued by the SEC.  They refused to cooperate with government subpoenas and had a stop 


order placed on their stock1.  


 Since 2000, OMEX executives and directors have received cash compensation over $20mm and 


have net sold $5mm of stock, shareholders have been diluted 7-X and accumulated losses of 


$180mm2.   


 We believe the purpose of OMEX is to serve as a vehicle for OMEX insiders to live a life of 


glamor hunting the ocean while disappointed investors foot the bill. 


We believe OMEX stock is worth $Zero and if OMEX is unable to raise equity they will be forced to file 


bankruptcy within the next 6-12 months. 


 In spite of the recent Gairsoppa success, OMEX’s business lines of historical shipwrecks and 


commodity shipwrecks have averaged $20mm of annual losses over the past 5 years and we 


believe are unlikely to repay OMEX’s growing debt burden. 


 The CEO has publicly stated they do not have enough cash to operate through the end of 20143 


and carries their debt at a discount to face value on their SEC financials4.

 As highlighted by the “Black Swan” debacle, we believe UNESCO’s new regulations to protect 


national gravesites and heritage make for-profit historic shipwreck hunting unviable. 


We believe OMEX’s new business of undersea mineral exploration is a pipedream and worth zero.   


 We believe that management representations of “$179mm of Off Balance Sheet Value” in 


equity stakes are inflated by at least a factor of 10 and we question whether they are based on 


non-arm’s length transactions. 


 In early 2013, OMEX created a new business “Oceanica” that utilizes opaque offshore 


subsidiaries in Panama and Bahamas that we question how there could be any valid business 


purpose and are reminiscent of Enron’s use of off balance sheet entities to obfuscate the true 


nature of cash transfers and inflate valuations.  


 We believe that Neptune Minerals, Inc. – founded by John Morris, co-founder and former CEO 


of OMEX – is also worthless and is simply a reincarnation of Neptune Minerals, Plc, a failed 


public company in the UK which John Morris acquired for $140,000 in 2011. 


 According to an attachment to OMEX’s recent 10Q, via Oceanica, OMEX is partners with a 


Panamanian company, DNA Ltd Inc.  Our investigation finds substantial evidence that DNA’s 


principal members are connected to at least 3 alleged pump and dump frauds and admitted 


involvement in the alleged $400mm money laundering scandal, “Teegan Inc.”  





What do we want?  


We fundamentally want the same thing that anyone long OMEX stock wants: Answers to our questions 


and more specific information about the company's operations, not vague platitudes or promises. 


What is our motivation? 


Our actions are all consistent with our words. We are short the stock because we believe if the Company 


provides true and clear answers to the serious questions we have raised then it will be readily apparent 


to ALL investors that the company, as it is currently performing, has approximately zero economic value 


to shareholders. We may be wrong in that belief and the stock may be worth some higher number, in 


which case, great, that's how markets are supposed to work! 





If you own the stock, you deserve answers more than anyone, so demand them from YOUR company. 


As shareholders, management reports to YOU. 


Key Questions for OMEX that Shareholders Deserve Answers to: 


1) Please explain OMEX co-founder John Morris’s involvement in Chatham Rock Phosphate, Neptune 


Minerals, and Oceanica? 


2) How much cash have John Morris and affiliated entities received from OMEX since 2008? 


3) How much cash has OMEX received from John Morris and affiliated entities since 2008?  


4) Why did OMEX improve the terms on the Galt Resources deal for ex-CEO and current consultant 


John Morris after the original contract had been signed?  Why is this fair to shareholders?
5 
 


5) Has Josh Adam, SVP of Neptune and Manager of Mako, ever received compensation directly or 


indirectly from OMEX? 


6) Is the “Brad Baker” who appears to have signed documents on behalf of Dorado (later, renamed 


Neptune), an ostensibly arms-length entity, the same Brad Baker that is on OMEX’s board?  


7) Please explain precisely why your offshore subsidiaries are necessary now (commencing in 2013) 


when in your previous 16 years of operations, OMEX never required these? 


8) In what banks and countries is OMEX holding shareholder cash? 


9) Why did you chose to partner with DNA, Ltd. Inc.?  Were you aware of the principal members’ 


connections to multiple alleged investment scams? 


10) Is OMEX using its offshore subsidiaries, formed in 2013, to make unlawful payments to government 


officials? 





This report is long, detailed and contains complex content. We address undersea mining and offshore 


subsidiaries in Chapter 3 and recommended investors familiar with OMEX begin there, specifically in 


sections 3 and 4, where we show that we believe the value of Neptune and Oceanica are likely zero. We 


explore in depth what we believe to be Oceanica’s cofounding shareholder, DNA Ltd, Inc, a Panamanian 


entity whose principal members are connected to a number of alleged financial crimes.

Introduction 


Touring the open oceans and hunting for shipwrecks can be an alluring, exciting, and glamorous pastime 


for the eccentric wealthy elite.  Historic shipwrecks have been the raw material for some of the greatest 


stories ever told.  When we discovered a public company named Odyssey Marine Exploration that was 


supposedly in the business of hunting for sunken ships and excavating the contents, it struck a tone of 


curiosity and yet incredulity with us.  Frankly, business is hard and doesn’t have a lot of glamour.  We 


believe people can spend their own money however they like but when management spends shareholder 


dollars in a way that puts their own pleasure or hobbies above their fiduciary duty, we take affront. 


Our team of researchers and lawyers are conducting a substantial investigation of publicly available 


information.  We have scoured court documents, SEC filings, international lawsuits, and have interviewed 


people around the world.  We dug as deep as Panamanian and Mexican business registries and are 


disturbed by what we have uncovered.  Though our investigation continues, we are sharing this report 


with the public and the relevant American and International authorities.  We are hopeful regulatory action 


will be taken in short order and will do our best to assist.  Although we are self-admitted capitalists, 


something strikes us as socially lacking with the concept of digging up tragic historical national 


graveyards to sell the heirlooms to the highest bidder. 


Meson Capital Partners LLC is better known for our efforts as constructive activists to help turn around 


and optimize faltering companies.  Indeed, OMEX insiders fit our profile of receiving generous 


compensation while producing consistent losses for the shareholders they have a duty to represent.  A 


fundamental problem of capitalism is when corporate insiders behave in a way that puts their own 


interests above those of their shareholders, to which they owe a fiduciary obligation. 


We believe that OMEX fits this “insiders first, shareholders last” pattern; however, the historically 


impressive ability of management to consistently promote and sell stock at prices well above our 


estimation of fair value has enabled OMEX to attract a growing investor base and the stock now carries a 


market capitalization in excess of $220 million.  After a thorough investigation, we believe that the 


damage has already been done for those who have purchased the stock.  It is time for investors to face the
9 
 


facts that we present in this report and conclude for themselves if they can reallocate their capital more 


productively and responsibly. 


There have been 7 public companies with almost identical business models as OMEX, the stocks of 


which all are now worthless or nearly worthless.  We believe that OMEX’s functional business model is 


to create fantastic stories to part a steady stream of beguiled investors from their money to finance 


insider’s glamorous adventures.  Shareholders have footed the bill, accumulating losses of $185mm as 


OMEX insiders Greg Stemm, John Morris and other insiders have enjoyed their charmed life of treasure 


hunting. Insiders have collectively received over $20mm of cash compensation since 2000 while 


personally net selling $5mm of stock to less informed public investors. 


After the “Black Swan” debacle, we believe OMEX essentially gave up their initial treasure hunting 


mission and now claim to have become experts in the unproven field of deep sea underwater mining.  The 


CEO stated they have enough cash to operate through “most of 2014.”5  To paraphrase another great 


story, the clock is about to strike midnight. 


We believe any new investors should be extremely cautious of OMEX’s promises given their 


disappointing track record.  Further, we believe that the highest and best use of OMEX’s assets would be 


to liquidate to competent dredging operators, however after severance costs, we believe it is unlikely 


shareholders will receive any value after the debt is repaid first.  We believe the downside case for 


shareholders, if OMEX continues on its current trajectory, is bankruptcy and liquidation within 6-9 


months resulting in $0.00 per share, and we also expect impairment for Fifth Third Bank’s secured loan.  


Though we would prefer to bring more positive news, we believe investors need to rip off the Band-Aid 


and acknowledge that they are holding losing lottery tickets.  The sooner investors refocus on companies 


with profitable, viable businesses, the better off both investors and the capital markets at large will be. 





Section 2 - Management are expert stock promoters with experience: prelude to OMEX 
We believe OMEX has a history of selling shareholders overly optimistic stories6 since 1997 while 


consistently selling stock7 to fund OMEX’s huge cash burn8, while management gets rich in the process9.  


Despite consistently falling short10, OMEX insiders have repeatedly sold large amounts of stock into the 


open market to public investors11 while disappointing on literally 100% of their projects12.  Furthermore, 


we believe racking up $185m of cumulative losses13 while management has pocketed tens of millions of 


dollars in compensation14 is an outrage and shareholders deserve better.   


Prelude to OMEX:  Seahawk Deep Ocean Technology, SEC Investigations and Financial Disaster 


OMEX’s co-founders, Greg Stemm (current CEO) and John Morris (former CEO and current 


“consultant”) are not new to deep sea exploration and financial disaster as they founded Seahawk Deep 


Ocean Technology (“SHWK)”)15.  Seahawk became a public company through reverse merger with shell

company “Fox Ridge Capital” purchased from Timothy Brasel of Colorado16.  Mr. Brasel appears to have 


been cited in an unrelated SEC civil action17: 


 “On Aug. 2, 1999 the Commission filed a federal lawsuit alleging that five individuals 


manipulated the price of a microcap stock through matched trades that gave the false 


appearance of demand during an unregistered public distribution of the stock.  The defendants 


include three residents of the Denver area, Richard H. Steinberg, Timothy J. Brasel, and Joseph 


J. Peirce, a Florida resident, Roger M. Taft, and Taft's son Stuart J. Taft, a resident of 


Connecticut.” 


Seahawk and “Fox Ridge Capital” were promoted by Kober Financial Corp., an alleged “blind pool 


vehicle” firm18. 


Following is a description of how Seahawk became public as reported in the New Yorker article “Secrets 


of the Deep”19: 


 “Up to this point, Stemm and Morris had funded the hunt with small investments from friends 


and relatives, who were promised a percentage of any profits. They now decided that the best way 


to raise a large amount of money quickly was to take Seahawk public. Morris met with brokers at 


Kober Financial Corporation, in Tampa, a firm that had access to a “blind pool” company. 


(Contributors to a blind pool allow brokers to decide how to invest their money.)” 


“Kober agreed to negotiate a merger between Seahawk and the blind-pool company, which had 


half a million dollars in its pool. After the merger, Seahawk became the country’s first publicly 


financed treasure-hunting company, and its stock began trading for half a penny a share. Stemm 


and Morris acquired sixty million shares each.” 


Once Seahawk was a publicly traded company (August 1, 1992), stories were published indicating 


Seawhawk’s shipwreck had potentially hundreds of millions of dollars of treasure, according to the New 


Yorker article.  Seahawk’s shares responded and the stock rose from $.005 to ~$0.8520.  Greg Stemm, 


John Morris and others began selling stock, netting huge gains, “in some cases over 3,000%”21.  When it 


was discovered there was no meaningful amount of treasure, shares plunged with public shareholders 


taking substantial losses22.  SHWK now trades for $0.0012 per share and does not appear to have filed 


current SEC filings in years23.

The SEC subsequently investigated Stemm, Morris and Seahawk24.   


“The S.E.C. offered Seahawk a deal: it would drop the charges against the company if Stemm, Morris, 


and Bagley resigned, and Seahawk agreed never again to employ them”    


We strongly recommend you read the following link that details the SEC’s allegations against Stemm, 


Morris and Seahawk:  http://www.sec.gov/litigation/aljdec/1993/id19930526ejk.pdf 


After Seahawk, Stemm and Morris started another deep sea exploration venture: Odyssey Marine 


Exploration (OMEX) that also became public through reverse merger with Remark/Universal Capital 


Corporation (“RUCC”), another Timothy J. Brasel shell company with the business address “16178 East

We examined past proxy filings and estimate named executives have received ~5.4 million options and 


1.6 million stock units since 2000, as far back as we could find data26. On a fully diluted basis, this is a 


whopping 7 million shares or ~9% of total shares outstanding27.  We see no justification for such awards 


given OMEX’s poor operating performance and high cash compensation.  Note that additional options 


granted to board of directors are not included in this discussion, so the actual figure is likely higher.   


Using historical insider sales data, including options monetization data, we estimate insiders have sold 


stock totaling ~$5 million net proceeds for insiders28. OMEX’s public shareholders appear to have 


financed a substantial transfer of wealth to management while OMEX has lost roughly $185 million29. 


2.  OMEX Projects Consistently Disappoint 


Below is a chart detailing every project we could find that OMEX has ever discussed as an active project 


in their SEC filings.  We estimate of the 17 projects OMEX pursued, they have excavated and generated 


material revenue on only 2 of them, indicating OMEX fails to generate revenue on 88.2% of their projects 


according to our estimates30.  If we compare total revenues guided by OMEX management or projected in 


news sources, what we view as investor expectations, versus what is eventually collected, we estimate 


only 2.025% of projected value was ever realized31.   


Of the two successfully excavated projects, projected value was still 672.03%32 more than the value 


actually realized33.  History doesn’t repeat but rhyme and based on over a decade of examples, we believe 


any project value number you hear in regards to OMEX should be discounted by ~97.97%34.  


Furthermore, in 16 years we were unable to find even one example where OMEX over delivered versus 


public expectations35.  We find the consistency of failure here telling about both management and the 


quality of OMEX’s business model.  








We estimate literally 100% of OMEX’s 17 projects over 16 years were disappointments 


relative to initial public expectations36.  We find this consistency incredible.  We believe 


OMEX’s executive’s core competency resides solely in selling stock to investors based on

plus option exercises minus sales.

wild promises that go unfulfilled.

Note: The third column of this table contains the highest estimate or projection of each project we were 


able to find at any point during each project’s life cycle and source URLs are cited in the table. 





Another interesting factor is the public support of OMEX by anonymous "analysts,” listed below.  When 


looking for experts in this “business,” we found an interesting pattern on SeekingAlpha in public OMEX 


articles and authors.  





We find it interesting there are an increasing number of OMEX posts by anonymous SeekingAlpha 


authors who have either posted mostly, or only, wildly optimistic articles about OMEX.  Also noteworthy 


is that positive OMEX article comments tend to be posted by authors whose only commentary on 


SeekingAlpha are concerning OMEX.  We determined that many such posters signed up on 


SeekingAlpha the same day and never posted again.   





3.  Insiders Sell Stock and Receive Millions in Proceeds 


The chart reflects OMEX’s market cap with positive news stories overlaid with management stock sales37.  


We think the pattern here is striking but we will let you draw your own conclusions. 





                                                           
37 Based on InsiderScore data of stock sales.
15 
 


Also note that a large number of OMEX management’s stock sales occurred at a market cap below the 


current level (suggesting to us that management was comfortable selling their shares at values far lower 


than today’s).  


Section 4 – OMEX management is overcompensated  
Lack of profitability or undersea recoveries does not seem to adversely impact management’s 


compensation as management is paid handsomely for meeting very low operating performance hurdles38.  


See the compensation chart below for 2012 for just the top 5 listed employees.  In 2012 OMEX lost over 


$18 million. 





It’s not just the staggering amount of management compensation that caught our attention but that 


compensation has also escalated over time as operating losses have continued to mount:  





Since 2007 executive compensation has dramatically increased and stayed high. For example, Stemm’s 


compensation nearly tripled while David Morris’s, John Morris’ brother, more than doubled.  We don’t 


understand why David Morris, for his role as “Assistant Secretary,” merits $416,000 in compensation in 


2012 alone.      


Section 5 – OMEX continues to enrich co-founder John Morris 
 


Another data point supporting our view that OMEX is unviable and a vehicle that enriches insiders, is that 


in the rare case that OMEX successfully recovers a find and is able to keep the proceeds, history indicates

shareholders still get the short end of the stick as OMEX give much of the upside away to John Morris39 


or struggle to sell whatever they find40.   





OMEX’s Many Related Party Transactions: Who is John Morris? 


Greg Stemm became CEO after John Morris, the co-founder of OMEX, stepped down. At the time, 


OMEX told shareholders John Morris was leaving to deal with “serious health issues”41.  What we know 


is that since stepping down as CEO of OMEX, John Morris has remained highly active and has an 


impressive workload, much of it with companies connected to OMEX. 


John Morris is: 


1. Full time consultant for OMEX paid $325,000+42 per year 


2. CEO and founder of Neptune Minerals43 


3. Involved in JCM Marine Venture, Galt Resources, Subsea Management LLC, Gulf Bargeco LLC, 


Subsea Investments I LLC, Subsea Investments II LLC, Subsea Investments III LLC, Seagrass 


Recovery Inc. and others44 


4. Involved and working with Josh Adam on many projects45. We discuss Mr. Adam below 


Mr. Morris’s current engagement as a special “consultant” to Odyssey Marine is a position that we 


estimate has allowed him to reap over $1.6 million (so far)46. 


John Morris (right) and Greg Stemm 





For starters, there’s this quote from the 2008 proxy statement disclosing that Mr. Morris received his full 


2007 bonus, a $325,000 “separation payment” or his cut of any debt or equity financing47:

40 We estimate that only 48% of the OMEX’s recovery from the SS Republic find in 2003 has been monetized to date

“Mr. Morris shall be entitled to compensation in an amount equal to the greater of $325,000 or 4.0% 


of the aggregate value of any debt or equity financing…payable within 10 days... Additionally, the 


Company has agreed to provide Mr. Morris with health benefits.” 





Note that his compensation is payable within 10 days. Is there some risk on any particular day that 


OMEX might not survive for another 10 days? We find it telling that John Morris is compensated on a 


percentage of the capital the company raises, with no reference to profit or revenue. 





SS Gairsoppa = John Morris’ “Galt Resources” Gets Paid far more than he did as CEO 


The SS Gairsoppa is one of only two major excavations OMEX has had in their 16 years of operating 


history48.  We believe OMEX shareholders may not understand how much of the value of this find was 


captured by John Morris and Galt. 


2012 Gairsoppa Estimated Proceeds 





2013 Gairsoppa Estimated Proceeds 








We believe the 2012 Gairsoppa excavation was barely profitable and our estimate of 2013 proceeds will 


not fund OMEX for even one year49.  Note that OMEX gave away a substantial amount of the upside of 


the value to the John Morris company “Galt Resources.” We suspect this is a dynamic missed by most 


shareholders, quoting from the most recent 10-K filing: 


“In February 2011, Odyssey entered into a project syndication deal with Galt Resources LLC 


(Galt). Odyssey received $7.5 million in cash from Galt to fund working capital of ongoing exploratory 


search operations for target projects. In return Galt received the rights to future revenues of selected 


project(s) equaling their initial investment plus three times the investment, which will be paid out of 


proceeds of the project(s). In addition, Galt will share in the future net proceeds of the selected project at 


the rate of 1% for every million invested. In January 2012, Odyssey and Galt agreed to bifurcate Galt’s 


selection between two projects, the SS Gairsoppa and HMS Victory. Galt has received two times its 


                                                           
48 See projects table on page 14 
49 Based on OMEX average annual loss per year over past five years of ~$20m
18 
 


initial investment of $7,512,500 from Odyssey’s proceeds from the SS Gairsoppa and will receive no 


further disbursements from the project. Galt received $2.5 million in November 2012 and the remaining 


$12.5 million in February 2013. Galt will also receive 50% of Odyssey’s net proceeds, if any, on the HMS 


Victory project until Galt receives two times its initial investment and thereafter will receive 7.5125% of 


Odyssey’s net proceeds from the HMS Victory project.” (Emphasis ours) 





More difficult for us to understand is why the terms of this agreement appear to have been changed to 


benefit John Morris and Galt Resources, at the expense of OMEX shareholders. We could not find any 


shareholder friendly reason for this amendment50.   


Even in the rare case where OMEX had a substantial find, John Morris was allowed to pick and choose 


the best one to participate in using information that public shareholders did not have.  “Galt will have the 


right to participate in the net proceeds, if any, from one of Odyssey’s projects to be chosen by Galt before 


the end of 2011”.  Why can’t shareholders choose to participate in OMEX’s rare successful target and not 


be burdened by any of the other losses? 


Section 6 – Even with the rare successful extraction, shipwreck assets are less valuable 


and take MANY years to monetize 
 


OMEX found the SS Republic in 2003 and apparently excavated 51,60051 coins.  As of OMEX’s most 


recent 10q filing they still held 25,000 coins52.  So based on our estimates, despite finding this ship 


approximately 10 years ago they have only monetized 51.5%53 of the find.  We believe it is amazing that 


in the rare chance OMEX actually finds, excavates and keeps something potentially valuable, they 


struggle to sell it over approximately 10 years. 





Section 7 – Did OMEX Chairmen Brad Baker sign for Dorado in an undisclosed related 


party transaction? 
 


Aside from John Morris, we find further evidence of what seems to be additional related party 


transactions with OMEX. 


Bradford Baker, OMEX Chairman of the Board: is he also an undisclosed board member of 


Dorado, a company in which OMEX invested? 


We have serious questions about Bradford B. Baker’s apparent involvement with Dorado (as 


discussed below, Dorado later merged into Neptune Minerals, a John Morris company that 


OMEX invested in).  Public filings by OMEX disclose that Mr. Baker is also the official 


responsible for signing SEC filings for Dorado54.  Brad Baker’s linkedin profile also seem to

indicate he was a board member at Dorado July, 2010 – May, 2011.  Is Mr. Baker on both sides 


of the transaction in what would be an apparently undisclosed related party relationship and 


conflict of interest? In this document55 we see what appears to be the same Brad Baker signing on 


behalf of Dorado – either that or this is an amazing coincidence56. 


Picture of Brad Baker57 





Brad Baker formerly served as director and Chairman of the Audit Committee of “DOBI Medical 


International” from 2003-200758.  While Mr. Baker was involved with DOBI, the SEC 


investigated the company resulting in the settlement of a securities fraud lawsuit.  Among the 


allegations was that management manipulated its stock price.  DOBI medical seems to have 


ultimately gone bankrupt and been delisted: 


“DOBI engaged in a course of conduct to raise money by means of fraud that 


involved issuing stock in a public offering. To promote the sale of these securities, DOBI 


and the other defendants manipulated DOBI's stock price; misrepresented the true 


characteristics, the development status, and the purported marketing of the ComfortScan 


machine; and misrepresented DOBI's true financial condition.59”  


It’s worth repeating that SEC allegations of stock and financial manipulation have repeatedly surfaced 


over time for numerous members of the current and past board and management of OMEX. 


Mr. Baker is also a long-time associate of Morris and Stemm, and seems to have been an original 


shareholder of Seahawk60. 





Section 8 – Despite bullish press releases, when reporting to the SEC, OMEX management 


seems to admit they are insolvent and unlikely to ever be profitable 
 


A daughter asks her father for advice about a boy who is interested in her.  The father replies that she 


should only pay attention to what the boy does and never anything that he says.  The SEC is like the girl’s 


father and the public is like the boy’s friends.  That boy is going to be pretty careful to not exaggerate the 


truth in front of her stern father.

One thing that we and other investors look for carefully is a divergence in statements to different groups 


of stakeholders.  SEC forms all have a section where the signatories must claim, under penalty of federal 


offense, that everything in the document is truthful.  TV interviews or investor conferences, for example, 


do not have the same strict guidelines.  Seahawk, OMEX’s predecessor, was charged by the SEC for 


making false and misleading statements in their SEC filings; people learn from their mistakes.  We note 


there are also no references to “$179 million of ‘off balance sheet’ value” in any of OMEX’s SEC filings. 


If investors look closely at their SEC filings, there is evidence that OMEX themselves seems to know 


they are going to continue to lose money. 


One data point supporting the assertion that OMEX will never achieve sustained profitability is how the 


company accounts for their own “Net Operating Loss Carry forwards (“NOLs”).  NOLs are past losses 


that can be offset against future profits for tax purposes.  If the company is likely to use these losses 


against future profits, the NOLs can be reported on the balance sheet at fair value as an asset.  If it is 


unlikely the company will be profitable than those NOLs cannot be carried on the balance sheet since 


they are unlikely to have value.   


The following is from OMEX’s most recent Form 10K filing: 


“[W]e have recorded a net deferred tax asset of $0 at December 31, 2012. As required by the 


Accounting for Income Taxes topic in the ASC, we have evaluated whether it is more likely than 


not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. Based on the available evidence, we have 


concluded that it is more likely than not that those assets would not be realizable….” 





Said differently, this implies that OMEX will not have enough profitability to realize their NOLs, and 


hence the net deferred tax asset is worth $0. 





OMEX carries their debt at less than the principal amount owed: 


According to OMEX’s 10Q filed for June 30, 201361, the principal balance of the [8% Convertible Senior 


Note Payable] at June 30, 2013 was $5,387,032.  However, OMEX carries it on their balance sheet as a 


liability – identified in Note H – at $4,496,280, a 16.5% discount to the principal balance?   


How can a company carry a liability at less than the amount owed?  One case where we have seen 


liabilities marked at less than par was during the financial crisis, as institutions were about to go bankrupt, 


they marked their liabilities “to market” as in theory, if they had the cash they could repurchase those debt 


obligations at a lower price than they owed on them.  Of course, this is a somewhat absurd rule that 


Charlie Munger has pointed out as if they actually had the cash to repurchase the debt then they wouldn’t 


be near insolvency and trading at a large discount!  If the enterprise cannot repay its debt obligations, 


what is the equity part of the capital structure worth? 


Even more troubling is a provision in OMEX’s 8% Convertible Senior Note Payable that is sometimes 


referred to as a “death spiral” conversion feature.  This allows the debt to be repaid in stock at a 15% 


discount to the market price which means that the lower the stock goes, the more dilution there is and 


there does not appear to be a floor:

The conversion rate applicable to any amortization payment that we make in shares of our common stock 


will be the lower of (a) the Conversion Price and (b) a price equal to 85.0% of the volume-weighted 


average price of our shares of common stock for a ten-day period immediately prior to the applicable 


amortization date. 





Section 9 – Get ready to lower your expectations: OMEX insiders receive bonuses if they 


burn less than $26.7mm per year 
 


When benchmarking themselves to peers, OMEX compares themselves to companies that are 


unprofitable.  In the 2012 and 2011 executive compensation benchmark from the proxy, OMEX 


conveniently chose a “peer group” with the following characteristics: 


“Bloomberg database of AMEX and NASDAQ companies with $125 - $175 million in market 


capitalization and under $10 million in revenue.” (with) “high market capitalization (peer group 


average $118 million), low revenue (peer group average $38 million) and negative earnings per 


share” 


Predictably, many of the companies in OMEX’s self-chosen “peer group” are now worthless in just the 


short amount of time that has passed since the most recent proxy was filed.  In its 2013 proxy published 


4/19/2013 OMEX cites 22 companies in its peer group, 18 of which are still public. Using pricing data 


from Capital IQ, we evaluated the performance of this peer group on a 3-year prior basis to today 


(approximately 42 months from 4/19/2010, 3 years before the proxy was published). The data reveal that 


in OMEX’s self-reported peer group, 14 of the existing 18 stocks had lost value over the time period, and 


11, or >60%, of these were down 50% or more over the time period. A startling 22% of the peer group (4 


/ 18) were down between ~90-99%, effectively representing a complete wipe out for shareholders of those 


stocks. 


The following chart from the company’s recent proxy filing also shows what OMEX’s Board believes is 


reasonable based on the performance targets set for management incentive bonuses.  Note the heavily 


weighted performance metric for burning “better than -$26.7 million in cash” in the plan year.  We 


believe these are shockingly bad performance expectations and do not understand why anyone deserves 


any bonus for simply burning less than -$26.7 million dollars in one year.
22 
 


Another indicator of how lax OMEX is on executive compensation, they apparently don’t think the value 


of recovered treasures is an important factor when setting management goals either62.  Does this seem like 


a good alignment of interest for shareholders?  Isn’t recovering undersea cargo the primary purpose of the 


company? 


“The value of recovered cargo was eliminated from the 2012 executive compensation plan...” 


Similar to the NOLs, does this imply that OMEX no longer expects to recover any cargo? We also believe 


this is likely for a variety of reasons outlined throughout this report. 


Chapter 2 – OMEX: Going to $0.00 in Less Than 12 Months63 
In part from management’s high compensation, OMEX has lost a truly incredible $185m since inception.  


Furthermore, we believe OMEX’s business is inherently unviable and getting worse64 as they rapidly 


burn cash and increase their debt burden.  We believe it is clear the primary reason OMEX still exists 


today is because of their ability to continuously issue stock.  We think OMEX will have difficulty finding 


investors willing to participate in a follow on offering65 and without this capital, OMEX will likely go 


bankrupt in less than 12 months66.  If regulatory action is taken due to this report, the timeframe could 


be far more rapid as we doubt the company’s lenders will wish to participate in such an exercise. 





Section 1 – We believe OMEX’s operating business model is unviable and has been 


supported by selling stock 
 


Why OMEX Lacks Serious Competition in the Deep Sea Treasure Hunting Business 


If deep sea exploration and treasure hunting were profitable and economically attractive, other deep sea 


offshore oil and gas exploration companies worldwide would be actively searching for shipwrecks and 


exploiting their cargos.  In fact, when OMEX does deep sea exploration and salvage work they typically 


charter ships from others and hire temporary contractors to perform the work.  Per OMEX’s 10K filing, 


most of OMEX’s 43 full time employees work at the corporate headquarters in Tampa, FL.  To go deep 


sea exploring, all you need is a few million dollars and access to a ship and crew, which are readily 


available for hire (as OMEX does).  If this business were so promising, we believe others would be using 


their own ships and crew to seek lost treasures.  Instead they lease them to OMEX. We think this situation 


is reminiscent of the 1800s gold rush where the people most likely to get rich were the ones selling and 


leasing tools to the prospectors, not the prospectors themselves. 


Another indication the deep sea exploration business is unattractive is that every one of the undersea 


treasure hunting companies to go public since 1997 that we found are all now worthless or nearly 


worthless67.

“There is not much money in the treasure hunting business.” 


 –John Morris, Founder, previous OMEX CEO and current consultant, De Bry testimony in Seahawk trial  


OMEX’s business is entirely unviable in our opinion and we wholeheartedly agree with John Morris’s 


assessment of the treasure hunting business. We wonder aloud, if John Morris believed there is not much 


money in the treasure hunting business, why did he co-found OMEX? We believe OMEX clearly lacks a 


viable business model and has no unique competitive advantages or ability to generate sustainable 


revenues or profits.  


OMEX has never shown they can consistently generate a profit despite 16 years of history. This chart 


gives a graphic view of the company’s operating history through 2008.  Since inception OMEX has lost 


approximately $185.0 million and losses have been accelerating.  In just the past 5 years, OMEX has a 


staggering cumulative loss of $101.2 million. Note again that Greg Stemm became CEO in 2008 and has 


presided over this period of accelerated losses relative to the pre-2008 period in which the company lost 


money at a slower rate. 





If You Can’t Generate Cash Flows from Operations…..Sell More Stock! 


Based on the company’s history of large losses (accumulated deficit of $185mm) discussed above, we 


doubt OMEX will ever generate sustainable positive cash flows, and as the table below shows, OMEX 


has survived this long because management has been successful in selling equity at highly dilutive terms. 


When OMEX became a public company through a reverse merger in 1998 around 10 million shares were 


outstanding.  The number of shares has since ballooned to more than 80 million (fully diluted) and 


counting. It’s impressive that OMEX has been able to repeatedly tap the capital markets for more equity 


given its historically dismal operating results and poor prospects, but we believe this is now coming to an 


end.  


The following chart shows the incredible growth in shares outstanding since OMEX went public via 


reverse merger:

Section 2 – The Vanishing promise of a For-Profit Historic Shipwreck Business: UNESCO 


and HMS Victory 
 


While OMEX’s financial track record is poor by any standard we can think of, the company’s outlook is 


also rapidly deteriorating. 


UNESCO: Legislating OMEX’s Treasure Hunting Business out of Existence? 


The “UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage” is an international 


agreement that, among other things, prohibits the sale of underwater treasure for profit from any 


shipwreck over 100 years old68.   


This 2001 agreement is gaining acceptance around the world and every year that goes by decreases the 


number of ships OMEX can ever target. Note that some countries have not ratified the entire agreement 


but that does not mean those countries have not adopted parts of this agreement as “best practice” they 


have committed to follow69.  


We see unmistakable evidence of the effect UNESCO regulations in the rapid disappearance of OMEX’s 


shipwreck pipeline (below) and latest push into deep sea mining and commodity salvage work, efforts we 


expect to be unprofitable.  The following chart details every court finding OMEX claimed in FL court to 


demonstrate their activity in securing legal rights to wrecks70.  This is a crucial process for OMEX, 


verified by the enormously expensive legal fees spent to “arrest” these shipwrecks for future salvage 


operations71. 





Note that OMEX has not filed a new claim since 2008.  The Company’s Form 10K filings over the past 


five years reveal a rapidly shrinking pipeline72 further supporting our conclusion that the deep sea treasure 


hunting business faces increased headwinds and is not viable.  It is not a coincidence OMEX is now

moving into speculative mining73 and lower margin, highly competitive salvage businesses74 as UNESCO 


applies primarily to ships 100+ years old.   


OMEX’s Last Treasure Ship HMS Victory: Already Delayed 2 Years and We Believe Near Certain 


Failure 


With a shrinking pipeline and increasing legal headwinds from the UNESCO convention, the last historic 


shipwreck OMEX is publicly discussing is the HMS Victory in the UK and we believe OMEX will come 


up empty on this endeavor.  Our view is based on the only non-OMEX analysis of the HMS Victory we 


found, which concluded it “very unlikely” the Victory ever had any treasure on it (explanation begins 


page 26, section 5.5 “Potential For The Presence of Valuable Cargo” in following linked document)75. 


In a violation of the international UNESCO agreement76, the UK unexplainably gave OMEX the right to 


exploit a historic UK deep sea national war grave site for profit.  To make the situation even more 


curious, we have been told an organization offered to work for free on the HMS Victory site initially and 


an open auction for the right to work on HMS Victory did not occur77. We believe there are certainly UK 


salvage firms and academic groups that would happily compete with OMEX for the right to participate in 


the opportunity to work on a UK national treasure – and we find it logical some competitors could 


complete the job at lower cost because they lack public company cost, excessive insider compensation, 


and/or have more archaeological experience.  As a result, the lack of an open, competitive and transparent 


process for awarding the salvage right is surprising to both us and a subject matter expert we spoke with78. 


It should be noted that OMEX charters ships and hires temporary contractors to work the HMS site (as 


was done with Gairsoppa and Mantolla) so claims that OMEX has unique abilities are not justified.  


Although OMEX technically has the relationship with the nonprofit gifted the right to salvage the HMS 


gravesite, OMEX hasn’t been able to convert this to an actual excavation for over two years and we 


believe the handwriting is on the wall.  Widespread public outrage in the UK about the situation is 


palpable as the following links indicate79:

http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/in-too-deep-warship-wreck-bounty-hunter-under-


scrutiny-from-britains-marine-watchdog-8906374.html 





Given the public and political reaction to the HMS Victory situation, we consider it extremely unlikely 


OMEX will be allowed to excavate and exploit the HMS Victory.  Imagine if a UK salvage company with 


a questionable track record planned to exploit historic US military shipwrecks and gravesites for profit 


and never faced a transparent or competitive process.  OMEX investors are hoping they could make 


“hundreds of millions of dollars” from this project, if this is true we don’t see how this is favorable for the 


                                                           
73 We were unable to find even one example of a successful deep sea mining business as far back as the 1970s. According to 
http://www.deepseaminingoutofourdepth.org/, Nautilus Minerals has the world’s first deep sea mining license. We remind readers that 
Nautilus currently has an accumulated deficit of $280mm and is currently in dispute with its licensing partner, Papua New Guinea.

UK and we also don’t understand how OMEX’s primary goal of maximizing profits aligns with the 


archaeological needs the UK people deserve.  We think this would never ever happen in the US or many 


other developed countries and, in our view, OMEX’s last treasure hunting project is dead. 


Furthermore, even if OMEX somehow overcomes all these obstacles and is able to successfully salvage 


the site and finds anything of value, the UK keeps ~20% of the proceeds (which seems shockingly low to 


us).  In addition, OMEX committed to pay John Morris’s Galt a 200% return on Galt’s initial investment 


plus 7.125% of the HMS profits so after operating and salvage expenses, management compensation and 


Galt’s share of the proceeds, it is very possible there is little left for OMEX and its shareholders.  


OMEX’s history with Spain’s “Black Swan,” the many HMS Victory issues and UK public outrage all do 


not bode well for other shipwrecks OMEX hopes to exploit.  With HMS Victory the last named treasure 


ship in the pipeline, we think the future for OMEX’s deep sea treasure hunting business is very bleak.  


We are sure the world is watching closely, making any potential progress with Gloucester site and 


“anonymous” Middle East royal families unlikely. 





Section 3 – We believe OMEX desperately needs to raise capital80 
As the years have gone by and losses mounted, OMEX has raised capital from what we believe are some 


of the least reputable underwriters on Wall Street based on the track record of their clients’ business and 


stock performance. More recently, the company’s balance sheet has deteriorated as they have increased 


debt and entered into an onerous convertible bond which contains a “death spiral”81 conversion feature82. 


It appears difficult for OMEX to continue to raise capital in light of accelerating operating losses, lack of 


substantial results from prior equity raises, and current net debt burden. We see this as consistent with 


Greg Stemm’s recent public statement83, “[OMEX is] in position to fund our scheduled exploration and 


recovery activities through this year and most of 2014.” We believe OMEX will lose the ability to sell 


stock to fund operating losses and the company will go bankrupt in less than one year. 


At Some Point Loss Making Businesses Run Out of Places to Raise Capital 


For unviable businesses, at some point legitimate sources of capital dry up and we believe OMEX is at 


this point.   


Looking at OMEX’s list of underwriters, including Chardan Capital, highlights our point.  Chardan is a 


firm specializing in raising equity for reverse merger companies (such as OMEX) with a long history of 


working with Chinese reverse mergers, many of which were proven to be fraudulent and delisted84.  


Chardan has been investigated by the SEC and FINRA resulting in sanctions and fines85,86.  


We pose several questions to investors: If OMEX has such bright prospects for its salvage recovery 


business why would it have difficulty raising capital from a recognized underwriter, such as a bulge 


bracket bank? If the undersea mining business were indeed so promising, wouldn’t Goldman Sachs, 


Citigroup or another top-tier investment bank be clamoring to get this business? Why hasn’t OMEX 


announced their supposed “top-tier” investment banking relationship the company has mentioned

repeatedly87? If a “top-tier” relationship really exists, surely now is the time to mention it because we 


estimate the company will be out of cash in the next 2-3 quarters88. 





Section 4 – OMEX management has publicly stated they don’t have enough cash to make 


it through 2014 
 


If this report didn’t already raise enough red flags, OMEX does not seem to have enough cash to make it 


through 2014 as they clearly state: 


“These results, along with planned monetization of mineral exploration projects, put us in position to 


fund our scheduled exploration and recovery activities through this year and most of 2014," said Greg 


Stemm, Odyssey's chief executive officer.
89


” 


We understand this to mean the CEO is telling us that, even with more financing involving questionable 


offshore mining ventures, OMEX won’t have enough cash to even last through next year.  What happens 


if OMEX cannot find more investors willing to buy OMEX shares?  We believe the stock will become 


worthless or nearly worthless, like every other publicly traded treasure hunting company we identified. 





Section 5 – OMEX’s shipwreck hunting peers have all imploded, including OMEX’s 


predecessor, Seahawk90 
We show this chart again because we think it is telling that there have been many deep sea exploration 


companies, including one run my OMEX’s management, and every single one of them has resulted in a 


stock price of zero or near zero.

Chapter 3 – We believe the undersea mineral exploration business is 


unviable and worth zero. In our view, management claims of “off 


balance sheet value” are based on non-arm’s length transactions, which 


we detail below. 
 


Section 1 – Understanding Complex Accounting 
We believe OMEX uses complex and opaque financial structures to obfuscate the true nature of cash 


transfers and massively inflate valuations of their undersea mining investments.  We believe there are a 


number of remarkable similarities to Enron both in the vagueness of the language and platitudes from 


management as well as the use of offshore financial structures managed by friendly parties with parallel 


relationships with the company.  In order to explain in detail what we believe is taking place, it is 


necessary to review some advanced accounting lessons.  We have done our best to illustrate and 


simplify the principles used. 


Fictitious Value Creation Accounting 101: Enron Case Study91 


Enron is famous now for their accounting scandal that covered up weak business performance until the 


charade was revealed and blew up in October 2001.  Enron’s President would dazzle investors with lofty 


but non-specific platitudes: from the 2000 (final) shareholder letter:  


“Our talented people, global presence, financial strength and massive market knowledge have created our 


sustainable and unique businesses.  EnronOnline will accelerate their growth.  We plan to leverage all of 


these competitive advantages to create significant value for our shareholders.”   


As it turned out there was one skill they were quite adept at: obfuscating financials to hide the fact that their 


business was worthless. 


The mechanism Enron used can be summarized as follows: 


1) Create and capitalize a Partnership (“Partnership”) with some partners in a way that carefully 


avoids GAAP consolidation of accounts while still holding a substantial level of influence or 


control over the subsidiary.   


a. For example, have your CFO, a board member, or a close friend control the subsidiary.  


2) The Partnership creates a new company called a Special Purpose Entity (“SPE”) which obfuscates 


the source of cash in a way that is not booked as an expense but rather an “investment”. 


3) The SPE can then take the cash from the Partnership, which is from Enron, in addition to money 


from outside investors as equity and debt. After the cash has been transferred, the SPE can then 


become a customer of Enron, sending the cash straight back to Enron (after paying healthy fees to 


the partners who are of course taking substantial risk should the scheme be uncovered: note, it was 


and jail time was served.) 


4) This cash recycling back to Enron (out of the left pocket and into the right!) is now booked as 


revenue and profits, which fictitiously inflated Enron’s accounts and valuation.
29 
 


5) Repeat steps 1-4 as needed for multiple layers of complex Partnerships and SPEs (for extra layers 


of obfuscation) to book desired arbitrary revenue and profitability while concealing losses in the 


unconsolidated entities. 











Fictitious Value Creation Accounting 201 


Enron’s investor base was driven by Wall Street’s quarterly earnings.  So Enron used their technique to 


boost GAAP earnings per share to reach their targets.  However, let’s take a hypothetical case where 


investors were not driven by quarterly earnings because the business was less mature.  Companies in a 


development phase are likely unprofitable so a more appropriate way to value them might be on a “Net 


Asset Value” (NAV) basis.   


Let’s investigate a possible technique that a clever CEO of hypothetical “Company X” could use in order 


to create fictitious value even more prodigiously than Enron attempted: 


1. Create or purchase a small company (“Holding”). With this technique consolidation is less 


important as the Earnings are a GAAP concept with specific rules while NAV is not as strictly 


calculated. 


a. For illustrative purposes, let’s say the Holding has no assets but when founded, Company 


X injects $10mm of cash into the Holding.
30 
 


b. Holding clearly has a $10mm valuation at this point, Company X owns 100% of it so their 


equity stake is worth $10mm. 


2. Company X transfers some money to a friendly party (“Friend”) – through an investment or perhaps 


by acting as a customer to Friend. 


a. For illustrative purposes, let’s say Company X transfers $15mm to Friend. 


b. In case you are curious – it would be preferable for Company X to transfer the $15mm as 


an investment rather than as a customer because then they do not need to book an expense, 


but if they are not concerned about profitability then the difference is less important. 


3. Company X then sells a stake in Holding to their Friend, who is ostensibly acting as an arms-length 


third party investor but is in fact simply recycling the money back from Company X (again, after a 


fee of course!  This stuff is risky once the lid gets blown off!  Enron : Prison) 


a. For illustrative purposes, let’s say Company X sells 10% of Holding to Friend for $14mm.  


This values all of Holding at $140mm and the 90% that Company X retains ownership of 


at $126mm. 


4. Et Voila: The $10mm of value now appears to have turned into $126mm of equity value based on 


the “valuation” that an ostensibly independent party paid!  1160% unrealized return! 


a. This is far more potent than Enron’s 101 example as Enron would only have booked the 


$15mm of recycled cash as $15mm revenue; here the effect is amplified by an order of 


magnitude! 








Now let’s step out of the classroom… 


Subsection 1 – OMEX’s claim of “Off Balance Sheet Value Creation” raises red flags
31 
 





Figure 1 Source: OMEX presentation at Craig Hallum Sept 25, 2013 


We believe OMEX is representing valuations of their stakes Neptune and Oceanica that are wildly 


overstated based on what we believe to be non-arm’s length valuations by third parties that have numerous 


ties to OMEX.  In this report we map out the spider web of connections between the parties involved. 


In fact, we believe that a more accurate valuation of these properties is the carrying value that OMEX uses 


on their balance sheet (which is zero). We believe that Neptune and Oceanica are at best, longshot concepts 


likely to end up valueless as we will discuss.  


Most alarmingly, OMEX, via their Oceanica, subsidiary is partnered with a newly formed company, 


DNA Ltd Inc.  DNA was formed by 3 principals and a lawyer who appear to have been connected to 


at least alleged 3 frauds before including a $400mm alleged money laundering scandal, Teegan, Inc., 


which we outline below. 





Subsection 2 - Why Value $179 million Of Mining Investments at $0.00 On OMEX’s Balance Sheet 


despite Clear Control of “Oceanica”? 
 


OMEX presents $179 million of off balance sheet value in their investments in offshore mining 


businesses at recent investment conferences despite the fact the investments are carried on the company’s 


balance sheet at $0.  Why?
32 
 





There have been recent financing transactions in all of these businesses that OMEX could use as the basis 


for valuing these investments92 and there are many public companies around the world that make private 


investments and value those on their balance sheet.  With respect to the 268,238 hectare Mexican 


“Oceanica” Project, there is a strong basis for consolidating the company with OMEX since they 


“control” over 50% of Oceanica shares and “control” Oceanica with 2 of 3 board seats93.

Section 3 – We believe Neptune Minerals, Inc is a re-run of Neptune Minerals Plc which 


IPO’d in the UK in 2005 and went defunct in 2009; it was resurrected in 2011 as John 


Morris acquired it for a mere $140,000 
 


“We’ve been paddling very hard since IPO”, says Neptune Minerals’ chief executive 


Simon McDonald. - 200794 


Neptune Minerals Plc. Raised $16.37mm in an IPO Oct 10, 2005 and a subsequent $5.01mm in a 


secondary offering June 18, 2007 – a total of $21.38mm raised from investors and subsequently written 


off.  Neptune had exploration licenses over a total of approximately 278,000 square kilometers.  As of 


June 30, 2009, Neptune Minerals Plc final filing as a public company: 


The group commenced active exploration in December 2005 within New Zealand waters.  As at 30 June 


2009, the Group owned 100% of Prospecting Licences (“PL”) PL 39-194 (Monowai, 47,110 square 


kilometres). PL 39-195 (Kermadec, 3,447 square kilometres) and PL 39-205 (Colville, 13,030 square 


kilometres). The Company holds 100% of each licence through Neptune Resources New Zealand Limited 


… 


The recoverability of the exploration expenditure is dependent upon economically recoverable mineral 


reserves being discovered in the licence areas and sufficient cash resources being available to enable the 


group to complete exploration activity and access those mineral reserves. The exploration expenditure 


relates only to mineral exploration activities in the New Zealand Kermadec, Monowai and Colville 


licence areas specifically vessel charter, 


seafloor mapping and surveying, sampling as 


well as environmental biological studies. Based 


on this uncertainty the Directors deem it 


prudent to write off these assets against the 


income statement.  





Subsequent to June 2009, Neptune reduced its 


staff to bare bones and discontinued filing 


financial statements with the regulatory 


authorities. 





Neptune redux, Plc.  Inc.: 


Let us walk through the history of Neptune Minerals, Inc., which OMEX owns 30% of and claims has a 


private market value of over $300mm based on its most recent capital raises.  We believe this valuation is 


incredulous and Neptune is likely a worthless business given that it was acquired for ½ a penny per share. 


February 23, 2011: John Morris & colleagues form Neptune Minerals, Inc and raise $20.78mm from 104 


investors ($200k per person):

Note: The filing appears to have been filed with the SEC about 18 months late. 


May 13, 2011: Less than 3 months later, Neptune Minerals, Inc. acquired Neptune Minerals, Plc for 


£0.002829 per share (roughly ½ a penny per share), for a total cost of approximately $140,000 or about 


the price of a high end Mercedes.  The tender offer process completed two months later on July 18, 2011. 


May 18, 2011: Neptune Minerals, Inc acquires Dorado Ocean Resources Ltd from OMEX in a stock 


swap – note Dorado was unable to service its debt to OMEX as we discuss elsewhere in this report and 


may have been a worthless entity. 


Neptune Minerals, Inc. entered into a share exchange agreement to acquire Dorado Ocean Resources Limited from Odyssey 


Marine Exploration Inc. (NasdaqCM: OMEX) and others on May 18, 2011. Under the terms of the deal, each one outstanding 


share of Dorado Ocean was exchanged for 1,000 shares of Neptune Minerals Class B non-voting common stock. Odyssey 


received 1.65 million shares of Neptune Minerals Class B non-voting common stock pursuant to the share exchange. Neptune 


Minerals assumed $8.2 million of the outstanding debt of Dorado Ocean owed to Odyssey. 


(Source: OMEX 8-K Filed June 7, 2011) 





June, 2011: OMEX “converted $2.5 million of the debt for 2.5 million shares of NMI Class B non-voting 


common stock.”  Why would Neptune convert debt to equity unless the equity was worth less than its 


debt?95 


March 12, 2012: OMEX reports that it generated $11.3mm revenue from Neptune Minerals Inc.  This 


represents 97% of OMEX’s expedition charter revenue in 201196. 


Aug 14, 2012: Neptune Minerals, Inc. announced that it would receive $35,000,000 in investment but 


could only close $3.5mm from one investor.  Who is this undisclosed investor - are they related to 


OMEX?97 





Nov 8, 2012: OMEX announces the following: 


“Odyssey is continuing to build on our pioneering work in the field of underwater mineral exploration 


and we have several opportunities to build shareholder value in this field,” said Greg Stemm, Odyssey 


CEO. “For example we currently hold 6.2 million shares of Neptune Minerals which recently secured 


additional funding to execute their initial drilling program. This recent capital raise was valued at $17.50 


per share, which would value our holding at more than $100 million.” 


http://www.shipwreck.net/pr256.php 


So based on a recent $3.5mm capital raise that appears to be 90% below expectations for Neptune 


Minerals, Inc., OMEX extrapolates a $100 million valuation for their stake. We still don’t know who the 


$3.5mm was raised from but we caution shareholders given the number of related party transactions 


OMEX and its current and former management are involved in.

March 7, 2013: Neptune Minerals, Inc announced that it will receive a $5,000,000 round of funding.  It 


was only able to close $800,000 from 6 investors98. 





Neptune appears to us to be a re-run of the same movie and raises serious questions: 


1) Does Neptune Minerals, Inc. have any exploration licenses in addition to those it acquired from 


Neptune Minerals, Plc for $140,000 in 2011? 


2) On Nov 8, 2012, OMEX CEO Greg Stemm claims that OMEX owns over $100 million worth of 


Neptune stock.  Is this based on the $3.5mm raise that Neptune completed from a single investor 


Aug 14, 2012? 


3) Was OMEX related somehow to the $3.5mm that Neptune raised at $17.50/share? 


4) How much cash has OMEX paid to or invested with John Morris and any affiliated entities since 


February 23, 2011 when he formed Neptune Minerals, Inc.? 





Do OMEX’s claim to investors of a $1-2 BILLION Neptune Minerals potential asset value seem 


reasonable to you?

Here is a screenshot from Capital IQ showing the connection between Neptune Minerals Plc. and Neptune 


Minerals Inc.  Note: These subsidiaries with the exploration licenses in multiple different countries 


existed before John Morris acquired Neptune Minerals Plc in 2011. 











Subsection 1 – Unwinding the web of relationships at Neptune Minerals, Chatham Rock 


Phosphate and Oceanica 
 


Remarkably, every offshore mining deal that OMEX has done since 2009 has been with a company 


directly or indirectly connected to John Morris.  This pattern is made clear by looking at the following 


new business ventures chronologically:
38 
 


 Neptune Minerals Predecessor - SMM, LLC (John Morris’s brother David Morris put on 


the Board):  In December 2009, OMEX paid $500,000 for a 25% stake in SMM99, LLC, 


OMEX’s first deep sea mining company operating in the South Pacific mining region.  The 


address for SMM is a residential home in Minnesota100.  John Morris’s brother, David Morris, 


was appointed to the company’s board of directors.  David Morris is also employed by OMEX as 


“Assistant Secretary”101.   





 Neptune Minerals Predecessor - Dorado Resources (John Morris Shareholder):  In April 


2010: OMEX exchanged its SMM shares for 450 shares of Dorado Resources and committed 


$2.0 million cash or marine services for all of Dorado’s 1,200 shares outstanding.  OMEX’s Q1 


2010 Form 10Q filing disclosed the following: 


“Certain individuals that are currently, or have been in the past, related to Odyssey, own shares 


in Dorado including John Morris (90 shares), Tom Dettweiler (90 shares), Roy Truman (23 


shares), Andrew Craig (45 shares) and shares are held in trust for Greg Stemm and Odyssey 


Marine Exploration (120 shares). In addition, Odyssey will provide proprietary expertise and 


personnel management to Dorado under contract.
102


” 


This disclosure is very unclear to us and we ask OMEX to clarify.  Did OMEX simply buy 


Dorado shares Morris and Stemm owned?  SMM and Dorado were referred to together and 


connected from OMEX’s first investment so were any OMEX employees or management also 


investors or otherwise involved in SMM, LLC? 


Note that SMM became Dorado which then became Neptune. This is hard to follow because 


the entities keep merging with one another, something we believe may be designed to 


obscure what is occurring.  


OMEX’s 2010 Form 10K filing disclosed that Dorado was charged $7.9 million for marine 


services performed by OMEX over a 12 month period but only paid $1.0 million.  The filing also 


disclosed Dorado had negative cash flows from operations in 2010 of $12 million so the poor 


financial performance of Neptune should be no surprise to OMEX since John Morris is on 


Dorado’s board.  An apparent question is why continue to provide deep sea mining services to 


Dorado knowing they have essentially no ability to pay for the work performed?  In any event, it 


should come as no surprise that OMEX subsequently wrote the receivable due from Dorado 


off103.  So Dorado (a company John Morris apparently owns shares in) benefited from OMEX’s 


work at the expense of OMEX’s shareholders? We interpret this to mean that Dorado essentially 


received free services from OMEX in the amount of $6.9mm. If true, that is a highly negative 


development for shareholders. 


We also note in the same filing that Robert Fraser Partners, another entity that OMEX provided 


services to, owed OMEX $1.6 million for their “Shantaram” project.  Fraser Partners has been

investigated in the UK for fraud in the past, its treasure hunting deals are under investigation for 


questionable tax treatment and OMEX did not collect on this receivable either104. 





Neptune Minerals (John Morris CEO):  In February 2011, OMEX entered an agreement to 


perform marine services at a 25% discount for Neptune Minerals (Neptune CEO is John Morris).  


Of note is that the 25% discount was paid to OMEX with more Neptune Minerals shares.  Since 


Neptune clearly could not previously even pay their own bills, judging by OMEX’s inability to 


collect on the money Dorado (the predecessor to Neptune) owed them, what do you think 


Neptune’s stock is worth?  Despite this complete loss on work provided just months prior, 


OMEX agreed to be paid in more Neptune stock. We believe Neptune Minerals shares are 


worthless: 


o In June 2011, OMEX exchanged all of its Dorado shares for Neptune shares105.  OMEX 


also forgave $2.5 million due from Dorado in exchange for Neptune Class B, non-voting 


stock and left the remaining $6.9 million balance outstanding on the balance sheet106.  


Finally, in OMEX’s Q2 Form 10Q filing, management states that Neptune’s $7.2 million 


loss to date far exceeds the investment in Neptune.   


o It also appears that OMEX, as of their last 10Q filed 8/8/13, doesn’t even have current  


Neptune financials despite being a large investor (quoted below).  OMEX also estimates 


Neptune will continue to lose money107, which means either OMEX will have to 


contribute more cash, be diluted, or provide more free services, none of which are 


positive for OMEX shareholders. 


 “The aforementioned loss carry forward is based on NMI’s last audited 


financial statements as of June 30, 2012 and is the best financial information 


available to us currently. With NMI being involved in the capital intensive deep-


sea mining and exploration industry as well as not having revenue, we believe 


their cumulative loss for their fiscal year ended June 30, 2013 will be several 


million dollars.” 





 Chatham Rock Phosphate (John Morris is a Very Large (19%+108) Investor109):  Chatham 


(trades in New Zealand, ticker “CRP”) is yet another company John Morris is invested in with a 


business relationship with OMEX.   





OMEX provided services in exchange for Chatham equity110.  John Morris is a manager, along 


with Josh Adam (refer back to the color chart on page 33), of a Florida based company called 


“Subsea Investments” that is one of the largest investors in Chatham111.  Chatham is proposing a 


plan involving sucking phosphate nodules from the ocean floor in New Zealand.  A recent article 


published in July 2013 by Business Day, Fairfax, NZ, reported Chatham attempted to raise up to

Business Day also reported in March 2012 some details of who is backing Chatham:   





“Subsea is a private equity fund backed by wealthy American investors, but the individuals in 


Subsea have not yet been identified by CRP. However, Florida state documents show that 


Subsea Investments II is managed by John C Morris, who is also chairman and chief executive 


of Neptune Minerals which has exploration tenements off New Zealand on the Kermadec Ridge 


to explore seafloor massive sulphides.
113


” 








John Morris Also Indirectly Connected to Oceanica through Mako/Hornet and Josh Adam 


Josh Adam is the individual who signed for Mako and Hornet in recent Oceanica transactions114.  OMEX 


appears to calculate their $68.3m Oceanica investment value based on the price Josh Adam’s Mako 


bought Oceanica shares from OMEX at and OMEX simultaneously acquired $1.25mm of stock from 


DNA Ltd, Inc.  Given Josh Adam’s relationship with John Morris, we question this arm’s length 


transaction and resulting implied valuation OMEX uses in investor presentations. 


Mr. Adam has worked closely with John Morris for years and Adam, who currently serves as SVP 


Finance of Neptune Minerals, was involved with John in “Subsea Investments II” as an investor in 


Chatham Rock Phosphate, and is on the board of many of Mr. Morris’s other businesses as well115. 





“Mako Resources LLC” is a Delaware LLC (#5277978) formed 1/22/13 that is signed for by Josh Adam.  


Mako is managed by “Hornet Management LLC” a Delaware LLC (#5277975) formed 1/22/13 also 


signed for by Josh Adam.  According to the Delaware records, both Mako and Hornet were formed just 5 


days after OMEX’s newly disclosed opaque Bahamian subsidiary, whose reason for existence we do not 


understand. 


Just like SMM the address for Mako and Hornet is listed is a residential address, in NYC:  300 Mercer St. 


#34m, New York, 10003

Section 4 – OCEANICA: the most questionable of OMEX underwriting mining businesses.  


Our research turns up SERIOUS questions 
 


Subsection 1 – OMEX Financing Transactions and Cash Flows Confuse Investors 
 


Given our questions and confusion regarding OMEX’s new subsidiaries, Oceanica and related party 


transactions, the following series of financing transactions and other events leave us troubled: 


 January 7, 2013:  Despite reporting $10 million cash on its balance sheet, OMEX announces 


they are deferring their monthly convertible debt payments.  They defer scheduled payments in 


December, January and February in exchange for lowering the conversion price of convertible 


stock options (more shareholder dilution)116.  If OMEX had $10m in cash on the balance sheet 


why did they incur these additional costs to postpone debt payments? 





At the same time, OMEX’s long time CFO, Michael J. Holmes announces his intention to 


retire117.  Mr. Holmes retirement announcement came just days before OMEX’s 10-K was 


published, which we interpret as a negative118. We note this was the same 10-K where opaque 


international subsidiaries were first disclosed. 








 February 25, 2013:  OMEX raised $10.0 million through a newly formed subsidiary119, 


“Oceanica Resources,” that in turn owns a newly formed business called “Exploraciones 


Oceanicos,” by selling $10.0 million of Oceanica stock to “Mako Resources LLC” run by Josh 


Adam (Neptune’s VP of Finance and close colleague of John Morris)120.   





 March 5, 2013:   OMEX sold 5 million more shares to “Mako Resources LLC” for $5.0 


million121.   





 June 14, 2013: OMEX raises a net $8.75mm through a complex transaction including reducing 


the exercise price on 8 million options held by Mako Resources by 50% ($2.50 to $1.25)122.   





Simultaneously, OMEX’s Bahamian subsidiary “Odyssey Marine Enterprises, Ltd.” pays “DNA 


Ltd Inc.” $1.25 million in cash in exchange for 1.0 million shares of Oceanica at $1.25 per share 


and some voting rights123. Is the timing of this cash payment a coincidence? We remind the reader 


that several people named on official Panamanian registration statements for DNA Ltd. have 


identical names to individuals involved in multiple alleged financial frauds. We discuss this in 


detail below and show DNA Ltd. Government documents.

 July 30, 2013 – OMEX closed a one year term loan July 30, 2013, that provided an additional 


$10.0 million credit facility with Fifth Third Bank. Despite showing $10.0 million cash on the 


balance sheet in Q1 and raising $23.75 million from Oceanica, OMEX seems to have needed 


more cash based on their need for this loan.  OMEX paid a $50,000 origination fee at closing and 


was required to deposit $500,000 into a restricted cash account to cover interest payments on the 


loan124.  If Fifth Third Bank saw OMEX had $10m+ in cash why did they require this $500k 


restricted deposit? If OMEX has cash on their balance sheet why pay these apparently 


unnecessary origination fees and interest expense? 


o The loan is secured by $15.0 million worth of silver recovered from the SS Gairsoppa 


and the SS Mantola shipwreck projects125.   OMEX took a full and immediate $10 


million draw against the facility implying to us OMEX needed over $33.75m in cash in 


the first 6 months of 2013 ($23.75m from Oceanica, $10m from this loan and ~$10m 


they had on the balance sheet at the start of the year)126. 


Is there a $10m+ hole in OMEX’s balance sheet in regards to their cash balances? Why else would 


they have needed to immediately draw the entire $10mm? 





Subsection 2 – Why does OMEX need offshore subsidiaries as of 2013 when it has been in the 


undersea minerals business since 2009127? 
OMEX initially became involved in underwater mining in 2009 with their investment in “SMM Project 


LLC”128.  Despite supposed years of involvement in international underwater mining, OMEX’s March 


2012 filed 2011 10k listed zero offshore subsidiaries.  OMEX disclosed in their 2013 10K filing five new 


subsidiaries: two in Panama, two in the Bahamas and one in Mexico

Subsection 3 – Drill Down Into Oceanica in Great Detail – Subsidiary Government Documents 





Below is our estimate of Oceanica’s Current Ownership Structure 





OMEX management has represented the underwater mining investment “Oceanica” as highly valuable 


that we believe investors rely on for their assessment of value for OMEX.  We would like to take a “deep 


dive” in to “Oceanica” to outline our questions about this investment, its partners and the valuation stated 


in OMEX investor presentations.   


As you can see from the chart above, Oceanica’s corporate structure is complex. We will do our best to 


simplify this as we proceed with our analysis of Oceanica by moving through the organizational structure 


addressing each level subsidiary and each partner in detail.   





Subsection 4 – OMEX’s Bahamian Subsidiaries - Commencing in 2013, OMEX has begun 


disclosing opaque offshore subsidiaries in the Bahamas. 
 


Enron used numerous opaque corporate structures to hide their business dealings and secretly move cash.   


Below is the local Bahamian government registration information for OMEX’s two disclosed Bahamian 


subsidiaries: Odyssey Enterprises Limited and Odyssey Marine Management.   


Note the payment to “DNA Ltd Inc.” (the entity we believe was started by the same people involved in 


numerous alleged financial crimes) seems to us to have occurred from an OMEX Bahamian subsidiary 


account as well129 – in other words, we believe OMEX has sent cash directly to “DNA Ltd Inc.” from 


OMEX’s newly disclosed offshore Bahamian account. It remains unclear to us why these Bahamian 


accounts are necessary.  


Note the sections highlighted in yellow below.

We find these two entities, one apparently created in 1983 and the other using an opaque company 


structure, very troubling.  We believe shareholders deserve to know why OMEX apparently created a 


second Bahamian subsidiary with an opaque corporate structure.   Note that Mako and Hornet were 


created130 just 5 days after the opaque “Odyssey Marine Management” appears to have been created.  





Subsection 5 – Oceanica Mexican Documents: Questionable OMEX “Oceanica” Ownership per 


Government Documents? 
Given our confusion over ownership claims and the fact Oceanica was apparently started by two people 


(listed below) with just Mex$50,000, we question how Oceanica could be a private company with a 


valuation in excess of $100 million?

OMEX SEC filings state they sold “Mako llc” a $10m stake in Oceanica on February 21, 2013131 when it 


looks to us like Mexico original “Oceanica” government documents (in part below) seem to show no 


evidence of OMEX on any Mexico Oceanica documents until May 2013? 








Apparently created in 2012 by these two people with just Mex$ 50,000 initial capital.

46 
 


Following are the current Panamanian government registration documents for OMEX’s “Oceanica 


Resources S.R.L.”, the entity that seem to us owns “Oceanica” and lists OMEX’s partners.  We believe 


this document raises serious questions requiring immediate answers from OMEX. 





Our understanding from speaking with registration officials in Panama is that this document is current, 


meaningfully updated for all current information. 


OMEX claims that Mako, which is managed by Hornet (Josh Adam is the signatory on the SEC Form D 


for both Mako and Hornet), is a large Oceanica shareholder. If Mako really is a large Oceanica 


shareholder, why isn't Mako or Hornet disclosed on this current document, or any public Oceanica 


government documents that we could find?   


Why does OMEX list their IBC Bahamian subsidiary here as the partner again and not one of their US 


subsidiaries?   


The $10.0 million that OMEX claims to have invested in Oceanica is not disclosed in detail anywhere that 


we can find – what, how, and to whom was this money spent on? 


On this Panamanian document we see two listed partners: “Hamdan y Manzanero” and “DNA ltd 


inc”. 





Subsection 7 – OMEX’s Oceanica Partner Hamdan y Manzanero - Why Has OMEX Partnered With 


A Mexican Lawyer in its Oceanica Mining Project? 


 
OMEX’s second listed partner, “Hamdan y Manzanero, Sapi de C.V.” is a small law office in Mexico 


City founded and run by Fauzi Hamdan Amad, listing OMEX as a client132.   





Why is OMEX partnering with Hamdan? How does this benefit shareholders? We looked into Hamdan 


and it’s unclear to us what relevance this has at all to OMEX shareholders or why Hamdan would make a 


good partner for Oceanica. 


                                                           
132 http://hamdan-manzanero.com/fauzi_en.html 


 



http://hamdan-manzanero.com/fauzi_en.html
47 
 





Mr. Hamdan had an extensive political career serving as federal congressman for two terms, three years 


as local congressman and Senator of the Mexican Republic for six years.  Fauzi seems to us to be a 


politically well-connected man.  Some may view this as a positive but we see more red flags. For 


example, one of the “founders” of Oceanica listed on Mexican government documents, “Carlos Arida 


Miguel”, was born 8/6/1924.  We do not find any mining background for this 89 year old and believe it is 


strange an old man with no apparent mining experience would found a 268,238 hectare mining venture 


off the coast of Baja Mexico.  In other unrelated companies we have researched, we have seen law firms 


frequently hold investments in their firm’s name for other individuals.  





The other apparent Oceanica “founder “Daniel de Narvaez McAllister (born 9/12/1952) from Columbia is 


an individual we plan to go into great detail later.
48 
 


Section 5: OMEX’s Oceanica Partner “DNA ltd inc” - Who is DNA Ltd Inc and why are they 


partnered in Oceanica?  Mapping out DNA Ltd Inc connections to alleged criminal activity. 
Recall DNA is an investor in Oceania (refer to the orange box chart of Oceanica investors on page 43 and 


OMEX’s Panamanian subsidiary documents on page 46) and through Oceanica, DNA is a partner of 


OMEX. 


OMEX’s Key Oceanica Partner “DNA Ltd Inc.” appears to have numerous alleged criminal connections.  


The connections are not easy to follow so we map them out below.

3. Pump and Dump 
Schemes??
49 
 


This part of the report is complex with lots of names and entities flying around. We ask for your patience 


and recommend printing out the graphic on the previous page to follow along as you read. We have color 


coded this organizational chart to make it easier to follow along. 


Recall from the orange box chart on page 43 that DNA Ltd. is an investor / partner in Oceanica, and 


therefore a direct partner of OMEX. As we described in a prior section of the report, there is a good case 


to be made that OMEX should be consolidating Oceanica on its balance sheet, and in fact this is a key 


pillar of the bull case: OMEX effectively controls Oceanica. 





So who is DNA Ltd.? We tried to answer this question and were shocked at what we found: 





DNA Ltd. is a Panamanian-registered entity. The names of the people on the official DNA Ltd. filing 


are the same names as people alleged to be involved in numerous financial and stock pump and 


dump frauds. 
  


We will now walk through boxes 1, 2 and 3 from the DNA connection chart above, providing detail and 


source filings for each of them. 





Subsection 1 – OMEX Partners DNA Ltd Inc Involved in $400m Money Laundering Scandal 


“Teegan Inc”? 
 


This section refers to box 1 in the graphic on page 48, a portion of which is reproduced below: 





Teegan Inc. is an alleged $400.0 million international money laundering scandal involving the 


participation of Panamanians listed as Anais Berrio, Daysi Lorena Gil and formed by Panamanian lawyer 


Roberto Guardia Rabell133,134. These same names all show up on OMEX’s partner, DNA ltd inc’s 


Panama government registration documents. While the investigation is ongoing, initial allegations are 


that a well-known Argentinian government construction tycoon Lazaro Baez used his son, Martin Baez, 


to launder $50-400 million through a network of international companies including a Panamanian 


company named “Teegan Inc.”135.

The Teegan story is complex and reads like a novel including private jets carrying duffle bags full of cash 


to hidden vaults, rigged public works project bids and a former president. 


Police Gathering Teegan Inc. Documents 





In addition to the Panama government documents we also have, from Belize, a copy of the original Belize 


company documents showing Martin Baez’s name along with the signature of both a Julio Collado 


Quiroz (Roberto Guardia Rabell’s partner) and a Daysi Lorena Gil. The personal signatures of a Daysi Gil 


and a Julio Collado appear on this Teegan document. 





All of these individuals admitted involvement when they resigned from Teegan after the news became an 


international scandal (see supporting resignation documents in appendix *2). 


Cedula numbers in Panama are akin to a US Social Security number. We obtained the numbers from 


Teegan documents for a Roberto Guardia Rabell’s (8-243-426), Julio Collado Quiroz - supposedly 


Roberto Guardia Rabell’s partner – (8-270-426), Daysi Lorena Gil (8-380-397) and Anais Berrio (8-797-


2464)136.  


Following is a picture of the current registration for “Teegan Inc” on file in Panama.  Before they 


resigned137, the previously listed directors of this company included a Daysi Lorena Gil, an Anais Berrio 


and an Eduardo Perez. Roberto Guardia Rabell’s name appears in yellow at the bottom.

We then compare the Teegan registration filing above with the DNA Ltd. filing below. 





Is it a coincidence that many of the names listed here also appeared on Teegan documents?   





Subsection 2 - Possible explanations for connection between OMEX and DNA Ltd Inc. principals? 





Possibility 1:  This is all an amazing coincidence of different identically named Panamanians all 


repeatedly working together with other identically named Panamanians, all working with the same 


Panamanian lawyers in multiple different shady schemes across the globe. This seems unlikely to us and 


it remains unclear why OMEX would be working with any Panamanian entities in the first place. 





Possibility 2:  The Anais and Guardia crews (described in detail below) are working with OMEX and 


OMEX is knowingly partnering with and paying cash to individuals with criminal connections.
52 
 


Possibility 3: The Anais and Guardia crew appears to be merely a front for an unnamed international 


group who consider using Anais and Guardia better than exposing their own identities.  Try to imagine 


the kind of people who would look worse on paper than the people listed as OMEX’s partners on “DNA 


ltd inc” and then realize OMEX just paid them $1.25 million in cash according to official SEC 


documents. 





Subsection 3 – DNA Ltd Inc. Directors Tied to Apparent International Alleged Theft Schemes “First 


Alliance”, “Secure Group” and “Century One”? 





Here we reproduce another piece of the DNA organizational chart: 





Roberto Guardia Rabell’s name appears on official government documents for First Alliance 


Management, Secure One Group and Century One Group as well. Recall that someone with an identical 


name is listed on DNA Ltd. documents above as attorney.  


The individuals involved in First Alliance, Secure One Group and Century One Group organized a ring of 


international businesses banned in Canada138 and found by Panamanian authorities to be without 


securities licenses139.  According to public complaints140, these companies allegedly set up offshore 


accounts and duped investors into thinking they ran a tax free offshore investment business.  Allegedly, 


once unsuspecting investors transferred money to the firm, supposedly for their investment accounts, it 


was not accounted for or returned141.  Our supporting evidence is below.   





First Alliance Management Supporting Evidence 


Canada banned a “First Alliance Management” from trading securities in Canada142 and then later made 


that ban permanent143.  Canada regulators also stated First Alliance Management has ties to another

Panamanian company named “Secure One Group”144.  National Securities Commission of Panama also 


found “First Alliance” shown above has no financial or securities licenses in Panama. 











The following are Panamanian government registration documents for “First Alliance Management”.  The 


original listed directors, before they all resigned, were Julio Collado Quiroz, Melitza Barrera, and an 


Ernesto Collado (allegedly Maribel Mendoza de Collado’s husband?) with “Guardia & Guardia” listed as 


the law firm. 








Secure One Group Evidence 


Canada regulators also banned Secure One Group from trading in Canada and find it operating without 


required securities licenses145.  Panama also found “Secure One Group” has no securities licenses in 


Panama.

Subsection 5: Undersea mining is not yet a proven concept, if it ultimately proves feasible, who do you 


think will be the leaders of tomorrow? 


 
George P. Mitchell, the late and brilliant businessman, had participated in the development of 10,000 oil 


wells during his expansive career.  Big oil and gas companies were long interested in shale gas but could 


not make the breakthrough in fracking to get the gas to flow.  Even with his vast experience and 


consistent history of successes, Mr. Mitchell spent ten stubborn years cracking the problem.  Everyone, he 


said, told him he was just wasting his time and money. 





If you gaze into the distant future and observe that undersea mining is at some point an economic pursuit, 


who do you think will be the pioneers of this, as yet unproven technique?  Will it be stubborn, persistent 


men with a string of success and overcoming challenges and solving problems like George P. Mitchell?  


Or will the leaders of tomorrow be stock promoters with a track record like those involved with OMEX? 





Chapter 4 – Conclusion 


Section 1 – Is OMEX’s Auditor Protecting Shareholders? 


What about OMEX’s auditor?  According to Capital IQ, OMEX has had only one auditor since going 


public via reverse merger, Ferlita, Walsh & Gonzalez P.A. Who is FWG? FWG is a tiny Florida firm with 


only one other public company client and whose primary business appears to us to be estate planning, not 


public company audit work.  FWG has also been investigated numerous times by the Public Company 


Accounting Oversight Board (the organization that audits auditors)158,159,160.

Section 2 – We Believe Shareholders Should Demand Immediate Transparency and Answers from OMEX. 


This report brings up serious questions for OMEX that are critical for OMEX shareholders to understand.  


We believe the only fair outcome for OMEX shareholders is for Greg Stemm and OMEX to host an 


investor conference call with an open Q&A to all investors to answer these questions once and for all.  


Meson Capital management is happy to assist and support shareholders in whatever way is necessary and 


look forward to seeing OMEX shareholders have the transparency they deserve. 





Section 3 – Whistleblowers Please Come Forward to Us 


We have spoken with archaeologists, journalists, analysts, government officials, shareholders and 


employees around the world and encourage everyone willing to come forward to contact us.  We will 


work with you to ensure you receive the highest degree of security and anonymity for your claims in 


order to give you a safe venue to voice your concerns without fear.   





Section 4 – Our Price Target: $0.0000 


Regarding the future prospects of OMEX, we believe Seahawk (SHWK), Greg Stemm and John Morris’s 


last deep sea exploration company, is an interesting template.  It currently trades at $0.0012 per share161 


and hasn’t filed current SEC filings in years.  The other template investors may use for OMEX are six 


other publicly traded deep sea exploration companies we found.   





The stocks of every single one of these companies are at or near zero. Notably, every company on this 


list was also taken public through a reverse merger like OMEX.  We think it is clear that over time, 


treasure hunting and deep sea exploration is a loss making venture that no underwriter or investor should 


ever consider to be a viable business or attractive investment.  Note that this report only contains the 


information we were comfortable disclosing publicly.  We have a lot more research not included here on 


many other topics.  We plan to publish future reports with additional relevant information.

Section 3 – OMEX’s other Panamanian subsidiary 
 


Oceanica Marine Operations S.R.L. 


See below for Panamanian registration documents for OMEX subsidiary “Oceanica Marine Operations 


S.R.L.”.  The law firm used to set this subsidiary up is apparently managed by Roberto Guardia Rabell.   


Greg Stemm appears to be the administrator for both Panamanian subsidiaries (below) and the Bahamian 


Subsidiary that lists officers names him as President.  How is it that the Bahamian subsidiary appears to 


have been formed in 1983 by Greg Stemm?  Did OMEX acquire this company from Greg Stemm in an 


undisclosed related party transaction?  Has ownership properly been transferred to OMEX or does it 


reside in Greg Stemm’s name personally?   


One thing we repeatedly saw with fraudulent Chinese companies is the foreign subsidiaries would in fact 


be owned directly by the CEO, not the company.  When the authorities came, all the cash was in the 


foreign sub and the CEO skipped town. 


We think it is also interesting that Bahamian subsidiary “Odyssey Marine Management, Ltd” listed below 


is an International Business Company (IBC) that does not disclose names of any directors and individuals 


involved. Why the apparently purposefully opaque subsidiary, OMEX? We note that Bahamian accounts 


have been used in unrelated (to OMEX) pump and dump schemes as such structures can hide ownership 


of accounts where ill-gotten proceeds are funneled. Why is this second OMEX Panamanian subsidiary 


(below) even necessary?
