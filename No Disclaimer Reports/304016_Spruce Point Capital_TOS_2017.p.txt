Spruce Point’s Recent Small Cap Stock Activist Success Stories


Past performance is no guarantee of future performance. Short-selling involves a high degree of risk, including the risk of infinite loss potential. Please see Full Legal Disclaimer at the front of the presentation.


Echo Global Logistics (Nasdaq: ECHO) CECO Environmental (Nasdaq: CECE)


Report Date 9/8/16 7/13/17


Market Cap $820 million $430 million


Company 
Promotion


An effective roll-up acquirer in the third party logistics 
sector capable of extracting significant operating leverage 
and $200-$300m of revenue synergies from the Command 


Transportation deal


An effective roll-up acquirer serving the environmental, energy, fluid 
handling and filtration industrial segments. Its largest PMFG acquisition 
would be a success and allow for rapid delivering of its balance sheet, 


and renewed organic growth opportunities


Our Criticism Echo’s management team has a history of value 
destruction, its roll-up strategy was ineffective, its organic 


growth was approaching zero, and its GAAP/Non-GAAP 
accounting was signaling financial strain. We argued it paid 


a peak multiple for Command and would never hit its 
synergy targets. We estimated 50%-60% downside risk in 


ECHO’s shares  


A poorly constructed roll-up. Based on our forensic
analysis, we argued CECO was forestalling a goodwill impairment, its


cash flow would fall significantly in 2017, and it could come under 
covenant pressure. We argued the company was misportraying its true 
leverage, and facing significant employee turnover and changes to its 


end markets which would pressure future earnings expansion. We 
estimated downside risk of 30-60%


Successful 
Outcome


In Q2’17 ECHO cut its FY17 revenue outlook and 
suspended longer-term guidance given changes in its end 
market and failure to hit synergy targets with Command. 


ECHO Sell-side brokers have finally downgraded their 
recommendations from Buy to Hold. ECHO’s shares fell to 


a 52 week low of $13, or nearly 50%


CECO took a goodwill impairment in Q1 as predicted, and changed its 
presentation of its financial leverage in its investors presentation -


implicitly acknowledging our criticism. Q1 and Q2 2017 results were 
significantly below expectations, it admitted continuing challenges in its 


end markets, and its YTD operating cash flow has evaporated. CECO’s 
shares were downgraded, and are at 52 week lows haven fallen >40%

Executive Summary
5


Spruce Point Is Short TSO3 (TSX: TOS / OTC: TSTIF) 
For The Following Reasons, Sees >80% Downside:


TSO3 Using the “Partnership” Playbook To Hype Its Potential: Déjà vu, TSO3 is repeating a twice failed playbook.  Recently from 
2009-2013, alongside of 3M: TSO3’s single product cycle ended with no material sales, termination of their partnership, and a 
legal settlement in favor of 3M.  TSO3’s prior two generations of this product also failed (the current 3rd generation VP4 appears 
eerily similar to the 2nd generation – not surprising given the low R&D spend)
TSO3 Overstating Its Total Addressable Market (TAM): All good promotions involve baiting investors with big addressable 
market opportunities. TSO3 appears to have overstated its true market potential by >30% units and C$170m. We provide 
evidence of the Company playing fast and loose with its numbers


TSO3 Is Just Another Canadian Healthcare Promotion: The Canadian markets are littered with recent examples of healthcare 
stocks in need of urgent medical attention, wounded from over-promotion, questionable practices, and poor performance. 
Short sellers made early warning calls on many names down >80%: Valeant, Concordia, Nobilis, CRH Medical


Disclosure Issues & Obfuscating Its Actual End Market Sales: TSO3 is not disclosing its installed base and the reason is obvious –
if it did, investors might see just how poor its product’s end market acceptance actually is. In Q3’16, TSO3 suggested it would 
provide clarity on its installed base in early 2017 – investors are still waiting…. TSO3 even stopped disclosing consumables sales 
in Q2’16. It currently recognizes as revenues shipments to Getinge, its 3rd party distributor (183 units since Q1’16).  However, 
our math and field checks suggest at best 10 units are actually installed at end customers (95% difference to shipments)


TSO3 Inc. (“TSO3” or “the Company”) makes low-temperature sterilization systems to eliminate microbial contaminants that 
cause infection. Founded in 1998, TSO3 is a regular stock promotion that has repeatedly disappointed investors by failing to 
broadly commercialize its product and show a profit. Déjà vu, now on its 3rd attempted generation STERIZONE VP4 and its 3rd


sales/distribution partner Getinge (previous partner 3M sued it), TSO3 is again baiting investors, who’ve bid its share price up 6x 
since 2014. Our fundamental and forensic analysis suggests investors should brace for disappointment and >80% downside risk.

Getinge Is Not The Solution To TSO3’s Problems: Bulls think the new Getinge sales partnership is the catalyst needed to spark a 
run towards C$87m in sales and C$0.22c of EPS in 2020. In reality, Getinge can walk away from the partnership for various 
reasons, and owns competing sterilizers that likely generate better margins. Getinge has actually purchased 9 sterilization 
companies prior to this glorified agreement with TSO3, including a low temperature solution called Stericool. Meanwhile 
Getinge has its own problems: its stock is down to multi-year lows, it has been forced to restructure, and churn through various
CEOs, It is also going through an FDA investigation into quality control at its plants, and a regulatory inquiry by Brazilian
authorities for alleged cartel activities

Spruce Point Is Short TSO3 (TSX: TOS / OTC: TSTIF) 
For The Following Reasons, Sees >80% Downside:


Valuation Downside Risk Potential 80%+: Our downside scenario likely plays out with Getinge walking away from TSO3, and not 
being willing to purchase anything further. In the absence of additional sales growth, TSO3 will continue to accumulate losses 
(cumulative life-to-date losses are $128m given it has spent 2x as much on SG&A than R&D over the same time period). TSO3 
currently trades at a preposterous 15x LTM sales and 19x book value, but bulls point to it being “cheap” at 2.7x and 12x sales 
and EPS in 2020. We believe that TSO3 is nothing more than a stock promotion, and it cannot generate a profit. Investors 
wanting exposure to sterilization products are better served owning a basket of peers which are profitable, pay dividends, and 
trade around 2x sales and book value on average. Ascribing a similar multiple range to TSO3 would result in 80%+ downside risk


Outclassed By Larger, Better Capitalized Incumbent Competition, TSO3 Stands Little Chance: Sterrad, owned by Johnson and 
Johnson (J&J), is the industry leader with a product that is cheaper, better on functionality and maintains a market leading 
installed base for >20 years.  TSO3’s has hyped investors on the potential of solving the superbug issue at hospitals – FDA 
presumably disagrees as it has recommended four potential solutions, none of which include TSO3’s product (VP4).  TSO3’s 
markets that its key value add is the VP4’s ability to sterilize scopes that no other device can; except it quietly recognizes that 
the VP4 may be damaging the medical devices being sterilized – an admission that the current generation may be doomed


Everything Must Be Executed Perfectly For TSO3 To Hit Lofty Analyst Goals And Price Target: To be long shares of TSO3, 
investors are ascribing a near certain likelihood that it will (i) displace current technology and entrenched incumbents, (ii) 
Getinge will win sales and push TSO3 ahead of competitive products (some that it owns), (iii) It will capture >30% of the market; 
(iv) it will surpass an 18 year track record of failure, and (v) it will achieve margins that no one else has in the space. Investors 
must also gain comfort around TSO3 specific risks: that it is a one product company that could be damaging medical devices, 
has a history of failed partnerships, no meaningful sales or evidence it can turn a profit in its long history, questionable 
disclosure practices, and limited alignment with insiders which own <1% of stock

Mgmt & Employment Issues: TSO3 management owns less than 1% of the company’s shares, and has no alignment with 
investors. Their main incentive is to collect bloated salaries, and care little if TSO3 continues to stuff shareholders with losses. 
Management itself is quite poor: its last CFO (Benoit Deschamps) left after its apparently pivotal 510k approval – another 
ominous sign. TSO3’s new CFO Glen Kayll was a board member at Argex Titanium (a failed stock promotion). CEO Ric Rumble 
was director at Bioexx which is now delisted. Employees typically know best: we estimate almost one third of TSO3 employees 
have left the Company since early 2015. The majority of employees that left lasted less than 18 months

TSO3’s Dirty Little Secret: Limited End 
Customers Actually Buying Its Product


• TSO3 doesn’t disclose units installed at end customers, and we think we know why. Our math suggests 5% of units shipped 
have been installed by Getinge; the VP4 has been approved since 2014 and been shipping since Q1’16!


• Recall that prior life cycles of this same product yielded less than 50 installs. TSO3 points to its arrangement with Getinge for 
not disclosing the information, but our review of the agreement doesn’t indicate to us they would be precluded from disclosing


• Until Q1 2016, TSO3 disclosed consumable sales which could provide a proxy of installed base, even this was removed in Q2 
2016. Don’t worry, if the company won’t provide the info, Spruce Point’s math and channel checks will help shed light. Note: 
TSO3 stated it stopped disclosing consumables because they were immaterial, does this imply the installed base is immaterial?


• TSO3 itself tells you that the middle man, aka Getinge, is buying this product to sit on it: “Additionally in the quarter we 
shipped our proprietary consumables to Getinge, who warehouses these along with sterilizers for resale to end customer 
healthcare institutions. ” (Q2 2017 CEO Commentary)


Be wary of TSO3 disclosures of units shipped to its marketing partner Getinge vs. units sold/installed to end customers. 
Spruce Point estimates max 10 units installed to end customers vs. 183 shipped to Getinge:  A 95% Difference

Déjà Vu: We’ve Seen TSO’s Partnership 
Hype Story Before


TSO3 is repeating a playbook from its past, the promotion of a key partnership that will result in millions 
of dollars in product sales. In the recent past it was 3M, and today it is Getinge.


TSO3’s previous deal with 3M resulted in a terminated agreement, a lawsuit, and no installed base!  


Round 1: Partnership with 3M (2009-13) Round 2: Partnership with Getinge (2015-current) Spruce Point Commentary


Sep 2, 2009: TSO3 entered into a 90 days 
exclusive negotiation period with 3M, for the 
distribution of the STERIZONE® 125L Sterilizer


Mar 6, 2015: TSO3 enters into first non-exclusive 
commercial agreement for Sterizone VP4 Sterilizer with 
Getinge


Step 1: Sign on a big partner


Dec 16, 2009: TSO3 and 3M announced 3M as 
exclusive supplier of Sterizone 125L+ Sterilizer


Nov 25, 2015: TSO3 and Getinge sign exclusive global 
distribution agreement


Step 2: Sign an exclusive agreement 
with that big partner


Dec 17, 2009: 3M marketing supervisor: “3M 
Canada looks forward to expanding its product 
offering with TSO3’s new sterilizer to better meet 
customer needs”


Nov 25, 2015: Joacim Lindoff (Pres of Getinge Infection)
“The STERIZONE® VP4 Sterilizer uniquely addresses an 
unmet global need”


Step 3: Get your big partner to state 
the world needs your product


Dec 29, 2009: TSO3 files supporting 
documentation for exporting Sterizone 125L+ to 
US and Europe


Dec 17, 2014: TSO3 receives 510k approval from FDA Step 4: Expand the capabilities of your 
product


Mar 17, 2010: TSO3 received initial purchase 
commitment from 3M


Jul 24, 2015: TSO3 receives purchase orders for VP4 Step 5: Get initial purchase orders and 
announce them as a key moment


Mar 2010: 3M Optreoz 125-Z exhibited at 
tradeshow AORN gathering 7k healthcare decision 
makers


Mar 6, 2015: VP4 sterilizer showcased at AORN Surgical 
conference which brings together 6k registrants


Step 6: Pay to have a booth at a big 
conference (even if it’s the same 
conference), but tell the world your 
product is being exhibited there!


Sep 30, 2011: Customers report high satisfaction 
with new sterilizer


Aug 3, 2016: From Q2 2016 results: “initial feedback from 
end customers has been strong”


Step 7: State high customer
satisfaction with your product


Aug 2, 2012: TSO3 terminates agreement with 3M
Jul 2, 2013: TSO3 settles dispute with 3M paying 
3M $2m in settlement fees and other


To be determined, see Spruce Point commentary  Will TSO’s fate suffer the same end 
twice?

Open Questions For Management


 Why doesn’t TSO3 disclose end user installations. Are we right that there have been <10 installations?


• How many of these installations received full pricing in accordance with advertised rate by 
TSO3/Getinge?


• How many of the installations were provided on a complimentary basis?
• How many installations have been returned by customers?


 Does the VP4 cause damage to medical devices it sterilizes?  Is the VP4 untested?


 How many more IFUs (Indications for Use) do competitors have versus the VP4?


 What portion of sterilization machines last 15 years if properly maintained? (reduces annual replacements)


 How much did Mount Sinai and other strategic installations pay for the VP4?


 It is generally understood that Europeans regulation allows for use of high level disinfectant (thus low 
temperature sterilization isn’t the norm) – how do you combat this?


 Why does the Company have an office in Myrtle Beach?  Is this advantageous to shareholders or so that C-
level employees can conveniently golf?


 Where does the Getinge agreement say that TSO3 cannot disclose its installed base?


• Why can it disclose cycles but not installed base?


After conducting our due diligence, Spruce Point believes the following questions need to be addressed.
Brief Overview of TSO3
12


Failure Is In TSO3’s DNA!


TSO3’s share price has been driven by repeated high expectations, met with subsequent product and partnership 
failures. Its share price is up 6x since 2014 by stoking hopes that its latest product can succeed, but Spruce Point 


believes disappointment looms large


 Generation one product was well received…until it wasn’t
• The 2006 Annual Report included the following statements about the first generation of the STERIZONE 125L Sterilizer: "addresses 


perfectly the evolving needs in sterilization…buyers express total satisfaction…ability to reduce sterilization costs and its fast instrument 
turnaround time…Manufacturers impressed with compatibility between their instruments and the 125L Ozone Sterilizer“


• The 2009 Annual Report painted a sharply contrasting picture: "it became obvious that the first generation of the STERIZONE 125L 
Sterilizer had not fully achieved the customers' needs for cycle speed and material compatibility.“


 Between 2009 and 2012 TSO3 failed with its 2nd generation 125L sterilizer with 3M


 The failures are stacking up
• TSO3 has failed with 2 partners in selling its product
• TSO3 tried doing it with its own sale force of 25+ people, once again – failure!
• Then 3M tried and failed!
• Can Getinge, a company that recently fired its CEO and is restructuring, really do a better job of selling TSO3’s only product?


 Two generations up, two generations the stock price precipitously declined, will generation 3 be any different?

TSO3 Has A Challenged Product Offering 
and Suboptimal Distribution Partner


TSO3’s Product Challenges


Description Comments
Breadth of Devices That Can Be Sterilized Sterrad lists 20,000 devices that can be sterilized while TSO3 lists approximately 3,000


Compatibility With Instruments Management acknowledges that most devices are designed for liquid disinfection, implying the TSO3 
process results in additional device service and repair (read costs)


Technology User Experience Competitors products have state of the art displays, TSO3 technology is dated due to lengthy approval 
process


Product Maintenance Competitors employ extensive network of ready to be deployed technicians, TSO3 lacks this critical 
support


Pricing / Discounting TSO3 product has list price in line with competitors, but isn’t in a financial position to offer comparable 
discounts


TSO3’s Distribution Partner Getinge Has Challenges


Description Comments


Overlapping Offering Gentige owns Stericool, a direct competitor to the TSO3 offering


Relationship Structure Gentige opted for a distribution agreement with TSO3, a weak commitment compared to the nine acquisitions it 
has done in the space


Relationship Continuity The TSO3 deal’s architect Andrew Ray, President / CEO Genitige Infection Control NA, left the company within a 
year of signing


Management Turnover Alex Meyer, Getinge CEO, ousted after 18 months (3rd CEO in 3 years)


Financial Performance Appointed new CFO in July 17 as company struggles with financial performance, regulatory investigations and 
multi-year low stock price


Corporate Restructuring Three business areas merged to form a single group unit per country 


FDA Matters Reached consent decree with FDA over manufacturing issues.  FDA matters still ongoing as of July ‘17

In Our View, TSO3 Is A Failed Business Model 
That Will Never Earn A Profit


Source: Company filings


TSO3 has generated just $38m of sales since inception and $128m of operating losses. 
Selling, general and administrative expenses are >2x research and development costs >a big red flag.


The result: corporate insiders benefit while the public shareholders and healthcare industry are no better off.

Capital Structure and Valuation

TSO3 has never made money, yet this time around, analysts see substantial revenue and earnings 
leverage resulting in a modest valuation on 2020 estimates. TSO3 is now priced for perfection!


By this time, Spruce Point believes investors will realize they would have been better off selling today 
to avoid substantial risk of disappointment

Déjà vu: TSO3 Hyping Another 
Partnership Deal Likely To Fail
17


The Failed Partner Tally Is High


Multiple commercialization failures coupled with top notch partners remind us of MannKind, which once 
boasted Sanofi as its distributor.  MannKind’s stock eventually collapsed down 95%.


SKYTRON Was TSO3’s First “Exclusive” Distribution Agreement
 “In 2003, TSO3 signed an exclusive distribution agreement with an American partner, SKYTRON. The Company began negotiating a new 


agreement in late 2005 and signed it in early 2006, under which TSO3 and SKYTRON agree to a transition period that will let TSO3 profit 
from any sales to accounts already contacted by this distributor, and using the Company’s own sales force, immediately assume the 
responsibility for managing all sales with new customers, now and in the future. The original agreement with the distributor included 
arrangements whereby TSO3 would transfer the product to the distributor with a 25% discount on the suggested retail price. ” (2007 AIF)


 "We realized in 2005 that our distributor was not going to reach the sales objectives that we had set.  To remedy this situation, we 
decided to utilize our own sales force to commercialize our products." (2005 Annual Report)


 Four years later, TSO3 did a complete about face on its sales channel, just as it had done on its claims about the product advantages.  The 
2009 Annual Report blamed the internal sales force for failure: "it was equally clear that we would continue to face the challenge of 
gaining significant traction in the global market, based on our sales channel. Quite simply put, we did not have the breadth and scale of 
organization required for global distribution of our single product.“ 


Another Partnership Touting Potential With Little Tangible Outcome
 “October 9, 2008 the Company announced the signing of an agreement with Mid-Atlantic Group Network of Shared Services 


(MAGNET). MAGNET, serves 11,000 healthcare providers by offering access to a contract portfolio of high-quality capital equipment and 
services. As a vendor partner, the Company will supply MAGNET’s members with its low temperature ozone sterilization system for 
hospital environments. ” (Mar 30, 2009 AIF)


And Let’s Not Forget The Hype Around Global Giant 3M Which Resulted In Failure
 “In the quarter ended June 30, 2013, the Company recorded a $1,923,398 cost in connection with the settlement that it reached with 


the 3M Company over the termination rights of the distribution agreement signed in December 2009. TSO3 has always maintained, and 
still maintains, that both parties had the right to terminate that distribution agreement. However, the 3M Company was disputing that 
right and a protracted litigation may have caused the Company to incur legal expenses and may have impacted its ability to obtain the 
right terms with a potential strategic partner. Therefore, the Company decided to incur the Settlement Cost in order to achieve a definitive 
conclusion of any dispute over the terminated agreement.” (Aug 5, 2014 PR for Q2 2014 Results)

Déjà Vu: We’ve Seen TSO’s Partnership 
Hype Story Before


TSO3 is repeating a playbook from its past, the promotion of a key partnership that will result in millions 
of dollars in product sales. In the recent past it was 3M, and today it is Getinge.


TSO3’s previous deal with 3M resulted in a terminated agreement, a lawsuit, and no installed base!  


Round 1: Partnership w/ 3M (2009-13) Round 2: Partnership w/ Getinge (2015-current) Commentary


Sep 2, 2009: TSO3 entered into a 90 days 
exclusive negotiation period with 3M, for the 
distribution of the STERIZONE® 125L Sterilizer


Mar 6, 2015: TSO3 enters into first non-exclusive 
commercial agreement for Sterizone VP4 Sterilizer 
with Getinge


Step 1: Sign on a big partner


Dec 16, 2009: TSO3 and 3M announced 3M as 
exclusive supplier of Sterizone 125L+ Sterilizer


Nov 25, 2015: TSO3 and Getinge sign exclusive global 
distribution agreement


Step 2: Sign an exclusive agreement with 
that big partner


Dec 17, 2009: 3M marketing supervisor: “3M 
Canada looks forward to expanding its product 
offering with TSO3’s new sterilizer to better meet 
customer needs”


Nov 25, 2015: Joacim Lindoff (Pres of Getinge
Infection) “The STERIZONE® VP4 Sterilizer uniquely 
addresses an unmet global need”


Step 3: Get your big partner to state the 
world needs your product


Dec 29, 2009: TSO3 files supporting 
documentation for exporting Sterizone 125L+ to 
US and Europe


Dec 17, 2014: TSO3 receives 510k approval from FDA Step 4: Expand the capabilities of your 
product


Mar 17, 2010: TSO3 received initial purchase 
commitment from 3M


Jul 24, 2015: TSO3 receives purchase orders for VP4 Step 5: Get initial purchase orders and 
announce them as a key moment


Mar 2010: 3M Optreoz 125-Z exhibited at 
tradeshow AORN gathering 7k healthcare 
decision makers


Mar 6, 2015: VP4 sterilizer showcased at AORN 
Surgical conference which brings together 6k 
registrants


Step 6: Pay to have a booth at a big 
conference (even if it’s the same 
conference), but tell the world your 
product is being exhibited there!


Sep 30, 2011: Customers report high satisfaction 
with new sterilizer


Aug 3, 2016: From Q2 2016 results: “initial feedback 
from end customers has been strong”


Step 7: State high customer satisfaction 
with your product


Aug 2, 2012: TSO3 terminates agreement w/ 3M
Jul 2, 2013: TSO3 settles dispute with 3M paying 
3M $2m in settlement fees and other


To be determined, see Spruce Point commentary  Will TSO’s fate suffer the same end twice?

Strike One + Two + Three = You’re Out! 


“Insanity Is Doing the Same Thing Over and Over Again and Expecting Different Results” ~Albert Einstein.  
After 18 years, TSO3 goes to market with similar technology to its 2nd generation product.  J&J has been 


selling and improving similar tech for >20 years.  Spruce Point’s prediction: Failure


 Strike One: Generation One Product
• It took five years (1998-2003) to develop the STERIZONE 125L, which used ozone as the main disinfectant 
• In 2003, TSO3’s initial sterilizer was approved by the FDA.  TSO3 described the STERIZONE 125L Sterilizer as "a unique new 


sterilization process that uses ozone as the sterilizing agent." The theory was that ozone would work better than hydrogen 
peroxide for low temperature sterilization in order to take market share from Sterrad and Steris.  Ozone sterilization clearly 
did not work, as sales fizzled with only 38 units sold over a period of five years – gen one FAIL!


 Strike Two: Generation Two Product
• TSO3 launched the STERIZONE 125L+, an overhauled sterilization technology to incorporate hydrogen peroxide sterilization 


prior to ozonation to remove excess hydrogen peroxide, in 2008.  While Health Canada cleared the STERIZONE 125L+ in 
2009, the FDA required changes and did not approve a revamped product, the STERIZONE VP4, until Dec 2014  


• It took another five years (2003-2008) to add hydrogen peroxide sterilization, which competitors already used, to produce 
the second generation sterilizer, the STERIZONE 125L+.  The FDA did not approve the product, so it could not be sold in the 
US – gen two FAIL!


 Strike Three: Generation Three Product, Evidence Suggests Limited End Customer Installations To Date
• The STERIZONE 125L+ was tweaked in order to obtain FDA approval and became the STERIZONE VP4.  It took about five 


years (2009 to 2014) to get FDA approval and another two years to get expanded FDA approval.  Talk about launching 
outdated technology 


• Recall that a prior version of this product was approved in Canada for a number of years and yielded no material sales. YTD, 
virtually all sales are in the United States and 98% are through Getinge

Questionable Management Team


TSO’s initial founders have largely cashed out and left the Company in the hands of a CEO and CFO 
with a mixed track record of value creation


Richard Rumble (CEO of TSO3)
 Was director at BioExx Specialty Proteins (Aug 2011-


Oct 2013) which was delisted in Nov 2013
 Worked at 3M in various capacities including Global 


Business Unit Manager for Sterile Processing.  Worth 
noting that he oversaw a failed business relationship 
with TSO3 that ended in a financial settlement


 Rick has sold C$3m of stock in the last 12 months


Glen Kayll (CFO of TSO3)
 Prior to TSO3, he was CFO and board member at Argex Titanium 


Inc. from Nov 2013 through Jun 2015 (source), over this time, the 
stock fell 78%


 We believe Argex was a stock promotion (similar to TSO3), that 
boasted an agreement w/PPG to legitimize itself


 Glen was also a board member at Brixton Metals which is down 
roughly 50% from the date he joined the company to current


 It is noted that Glen was involved with Coastal Contacts which was 
acquired

Like Most Stock Promotions, 
Insider Alignment With Shareholders = 0


TSO3 insiders own virtually no stock, which means they have nothing at risk if the Company fails. 
Furthermore, the CEO discretely signaled to the market that he plans to liquidate his miniscule position!


 CEO reducing already small position: “With all that in mind, and exactly when I am the most excited I have ever been 
about our future, I must begin exercising and selling a portion of soon-to-expire stock options that I have held since I 
joined the Company. I expect to be exercising them in an orderly fashion over the next 18 months”


 Ric Rumble has sold C$3.3 million worth of stock in the last year
• This represents over 90% of the common shares he holds and 1/3 of total options he held prior to these sales

Bloated Management Compensation


TSO3’s executive compensation is bloated and its top 5 executives account for 56% of SG&A. 
If management cut its salary and took all equity, TSO3 might have a chance at profitability!


With nothing at stake or at risk, we expect management salaries to remain bloated and be the 
principal driver of management’s motivation, not necessarily to turn a profit for shareholders

Is TSO3 Myrtle Beach, South Carolina 
Office: For Golf or Business?


Dovetailing our concerns about management using TSO3 to milk compensation and perks from shareholders, we note that in July 
2015 TSO3 announced intentions to open a Myrtle Beach, South Carolina location of 6,000 sqft for customer service, clinical 


education, warehousing and servicing. (1) Myrtle Beach is known more for its beaches and golf courses, than for its hub in the 
sterilization industry. Naturally, we were curious to see what was there so did some investigating but didn’t find much activity.

 TSO3 has turned over 30% of its employees since late 2015 that we can identify (note: this is understated by turnover Spruce 
Point was unable to find)
• We estimate TSO3 has turned over 25 employees since late 2015 (15 of these employees left in under 18 months)
• Notice TSO3’s recent Aug 2017 corporate presentation now omits employee count (source, slide 30) vs. May 2017 


presentation (source, slide 27)
 Key employee Dr. Mark Pasmore, VP of R&D, left within just 6 months on the job
 TSO3 has cycled through 3 CFOs since mid-2015 (Current Glenn Kayll, Former Interim Elena Simard-Veilleux, Former Benoit 


Deschamps) – note: Benoit Deschamps left TSO3 to become a financial advisor and left after the Company’s pivotal 510k

Sprott: Selected Equity Positions Commentary


TSO3 Inc. • As extensively described in this report


Intertain Group • As extensively described in prior Spruce Point report from Dec 2015


Nobilis Health • Fell under harsh criticism from an anonymous blogger and shares have not recovered


Asanko Gold • Stock is down 85% from highs (70% from Mar 31, 2017), first targeted by K2 & Associates
• On Mar 31, 2017, Muddy Water’s highlighted the stock “is highly likely to end up a zero” while also 


calling the stock “a Ponzi scheme” (source)


AutoCanada Inc. • Stock down over 70% from highs due to accounting issues, lack of free cash flows, poor business 
model and management concerns


Patient Home Monitoring & 
Convalo Health


• Stock down almost 80% due to aggressive roll up strategy, poor underlying assets, and questionable 
management


Concordia International • Stock down over 80% due to poor accounting, aggressive pricing tactics, poor management, troubled 
generics business and subpar acquisition strategy


As part of proper investment due diligence, we believe it is prudent to analyze and study the behavior of 
institutional investors behind a stock.

 Sprott Canadian Equity Fund (and related Sprott funds) own 13% of TSO3 stock outstanding; TSO3 is its largest current fund holding
 Sprott’s Fund is down over 13.4% year-to-date in 2017 (source), was down 1.6% in 2016 (source), and down 15.2% in 2015 (source)


• Even Eric Nuttall, a Sprott Portfolio Manager disagrees with his colleagues and has long since sold TSO3 (source)
 TSO3’s 5th largest holder is mutual fund IG Investment Management; IG has 46 positions;  TSO3 is the smallest market cap of the top 


20 holdings which have an average market cap of over US$100bn
 Peter Imhof from AGF as to why he sold TSO3 (Dec 20, 2016): “I just thought that there wasn’t a lot of visibility in terms of what 


the sell through was with their partner, they said they’ve bought them but we don’t actually know if they’ve been deployed into the 
hospitals for sterilization.  I think in this environment with biotechs, you know, you want make sure you got the visibility”

TSO3 Outclassed By Larger 
Competitors With Better Products

TSO3 Outclassed By The Competition


TSO3 | Sterizone VP4


• Competitor products even look materially better than the newer TSO3 product with a more up to date touch screen
• Technology - One aspect of the VP4 that stands out is the tiny monochrome screen.  The VP4 screen looks like the same vintage of 


technology as the STERIZONE 125 and STERIZONE 125L+, which begs the question of how old is the VP4 technology?  For comparison, 
the latest model of the STERRAD 100NX has a much larger, modern screen inside a machine that looks like it has evolved over the past 
decade.  Johnson and Johnson’s STERRAD 100NX ALLClear is like a new Apple computer, while the VP4 is like a 10 year old PC.

Cheaper Competing Products With 
Greater Functionality


The VP4 does not appear to hold a candle to competing products


 J&J’s Sterrad brand has had a hydrogen peroxide sterilizer in the market since 1993
• The main difference is TSO3 product use ozone vs. Sterrad which uses plasma to that same end
• J&J’s market cap is 80+ times larger than Getinge
• J&J is rumoured to have over 60% of the market installed base and annual resales
• TSO3 going up against giant J&J: who do you think wins that battle?


 Comparison on Price: Sticker price is equal for all three.  However, with Sterrad and Steris discounting, they can 
come in at the US$100k price whereas TSO3 comes in slightly higher.  TSO3 appears to have negative margins on 
the device, making it more difficult for them to compete here  


 Functionality and Service: TSO3 also can't compete on functionality or service.  The VP4 (TSO3 product) is 
untested and rumoured to damage equipment through sterilization (caused by ozone). STERRAD has an online 
resource that lists over 20,000 devices that can be sterilized with its equipment.  TSO3's also provides an online 
sterility matrix, but it only lists approximately 3,000 products. Sure, the STERIZONE VP4 can handle more 
equipment weight than a STERRAD NX100, but who cares if you can't readily tell if the equipment can't safely be 
sterilized by the VP4?  Furthermore, what happens if the sterilizer breaks down?  Competitors like STERRAD and 
STERIS employ an extensive network of technicians that can be deployed quickly.  If a STERIZONE VP4 breaks, 
repairs will take much longer and that means a facility's ability to sterilize equipment grinds to a halt, impacting

Superbug Promotion


Just like the Zika virus caused a media stir and prompted a multitude of companies claiming to have a 
solution in order to promote their speculative stocks (eg. XON, INO) we find that TSO3 has latched on to 


the story of the Superbug as a reason why its product is critically important.

FDA Guidance On Potential Superbug 
Solutions Don’t Include TSO3 Approach


Despite TSO3 suggestions, there are various ways the superbug problem can be solved. 
TSO3 is not the only game in town when it comes to solutions


 The FDA has suggested possible solutions for solving the superbug problem and does not contemplate TSO3’s form of low 
temperature sterilization.  The four suggestions are (note that hydrogen peroxide or ozone are not mentioned as 
solutions but the VP4 by TSO3 does not offer this):


• Microbiological Culturing
• Ethylene Oxide Sterilization (not TSO3 solution but rather a 3M approved product called the Steri-Vac)
• Use of a Liquid Chemical Sterilant Processing System
• Repeat High-Level Disinfection


• The sterilization market is split into various types implying there are many ways for the superbug problem to be solved 
(Markets and Markets Research Report)


• Heat Sterilization/High-temperature Sterilization
• Moist Heat Sterilization


• By Product: Traditional Sterilizers, Tabletop Sterilizers
• By Technology: Gravity, Pre-vacuum, Steam-flush Pressure-pulse


• Dry Heat sterilization
• Low-temperature Sterilization


• Ethelene Oxide Sterilization, Vaporized hydrogen peroxide Sterilization, Hydrogen Peroxide Gas Plasma 
Sterilization, Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) Sterilization, Ozone-based Medical Sterilization, Superheated Water 
Spray Sterilization, Low-temperature Steam Formaldehyde Sterilization


• Filtration Sterilization
• Ionizing Radiation Sterilization: E-beam, X-ray, Gamma


TSO3’s VP4 fits in here, but a small part of a 
much larger sterilization universe (and even 
smaller part given its just one piece of the 


low temp sterilization market)

Is TSO3’s Marketed Product Value-Add 
Or Really Smoke And Mirrors?


TSO3 has spent time marketing that their VP4 can sterilize scopes that other devices cannot. Read 
the following paragraph carefully – it implies that the VP4 damages scopes and that scopes were 


not built for low temperature sterilization


From The Q3 2016 Earnings Conference Call: 


“Our testing will continue through the end of the year and we will advise when we are ready to approach the US 
market sometime early in 2017. Now, as previously stated, these multi-channel flexible endoscopes or instruments 
were not designed or produced with terminal sterilization in mind. The manufacturers either did not contemplate 
that a sterilization technology would be robust enough to create a sterilization event or we believe that the liquid 
process could in fact produce a contaminant-free scope between patient cases. Either way, these devices were 
made for liquid disinfection between users. As such, when we sterilize a device, we see that selective components 
have increased where -- which can cause an increased need for service and repair.”
The Untold Story With The 
Getinge Relationship
36


 In November 2015, TSO3 expanded its partnership with Getinge


 In December 2015, Getinge stated their view of the entire low temperature sterilization market as 23%:


Management Clearly Misleading Its TAM


News Flash: TSO3 doesn’t have its numbers straight!  They cited 3,000 units at C$450m annually whereas Getinge 
cites 2,300 units at C$278m (SEK1.7bn) annually. Who do you think has a better view of marketing demand, the 


manufacturer, or the marketing agent out speaking with customers?

http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20151214005972/en/Getinge-Infection-Control-Enters-Temperature-Market-Acquisition
37


 Getinge acquired Stericool and signed a glorified sales agreement with TSO3


• TSO3 appears to be a low cost call option to Getinge, which spent just 4% of its cash for an upfront, one-
time licensing fee of US$7.5m for the IP


• If TSO3 were so promising, why not just buy the whole company on the cheap? 
• Getinge paid SEK 56m (US$6.5m) for Stericool which had SEK 20m ($2.3m) of sales > 1.8x sales multiple


 Getinge’s reference of 2,300 units annually for market size must relate to both Stericool and TSO3’s product, 
which may imply that the market is even smaller for TSO3


 These figures cite global market potential, so the US and Europe market where TSO3/Getinge are currently 
focused, could be much smaller (note: TSO3 is only approved for sale in the US/Europe/Canada)


Getinge Bought A Competing Sterilization Device

Getinge’s Substitute Competitive Products


Getinge has even more similar low-temperature products, even products it markets under its own brand name. 
It is clear from the placement on its website that Getinge gives TSO3 STERIZONE product the lowest priority 


placement. It is likely Getinge’s salesforce also gives lower priority to selling third party products vs. its own by 
receiving less sales commission.

39


Getinge Is Very Active In The 
Sterilization Market


Getinge has made many acquisitions in the infection control and sterilization market in the past few 
decades. It had many opportunities to acquire all of TSO3 at a fraction of the current valuation, but instead 


opted for a low commitment distribution agreement. 
We believe its recent acquisition of Stericool at just 1.8x sales validates TSO3’s overvaluation.

Getinge Has Had A Tumultuous Few Years, 
Poor TSO3 Transaction and Lack of Interest


With the original architect behind the TSO3/Getinge deal having departed, the company going 
through a large restructuring program, declining financial performance, and broadening regulatory 
investigations, we wonder how focused Getinge can be on promoting TSO3’s products given that it 


may never be a material driver to its bottom-line.


 The Getinge agreement with TSO3 came at a time when the Company was clearly under stress and turmoil, 
and its share price has subsequently been under severe pressue (source):


• The original architect of the deal, Mr. Andrew Ray, President and CEO of Getinge Infection Control North 
America subsequently departed. Mr. Ray promoted the initial announcement of the deal in March 2015 
(source). He later left Getinge and joined Nilfisk in 2016 as EVP Americas (source)


• The Company went through a broader restructuring program with three business areas merged to form 
a single group-wide unit per country (2015 Annual Report)


• Managerial changes reached the highest level of the organization with Alex Myers (CEO of Getinge) 
being ousted after just 18 months on the job (3rd CEO in 3 years)


• Getinge investigated by the FDA related to manufacturing issues and reached a consent decree (source). 
FDA matters continue to weigh on Getinge through July 2017 (source)


• Getinge’s share price hits multi-year lows in July 2017 as it appoints new CFO, struggles with declining 
financial performance, and discloses regulatory investigations by Brazilian authorities

Will Getinge Stop Purchase Orders?


With sell through as weak as it is based on Spruce Point’s research, will Getinge terminate the contract, 
return products or stop ordering at some point? We don’t believe Getinge sales have been higher than its 
Minimum Annual Purchase Commitments (recall 186 units shipped vs. 10 units estimated to be installed)


 Despite a heavily redacted agreement between TSO3 and Getinge filed at SEDAR, it appears clear that Getinge 
can walk away whenever they please under a broadly defined clause:


Extract filed at SEDAR on Dec 4, 2015: Getinge / TSO3 Heavily Redacted Distribution Agreement



http://www.sedar.com/GetFile.do?lang=EN&docClass=36&issuerNo=00016125&issuerType=03&projectNo=02427300&docId=3840672
42


Unusual Accounts Receivable Factoring


Spruce Point is perplexed as to why TSO3 would need to factor its Getinge receivables at a discount, when 
its balance sheet has nearly C$17m of cash and short-term investments, its counter-party is a large and 


global corporation, and the outlook for the relationship is supposedly bright according to TSO3


 On Dec 22, 2016, TSO3 entered a receivables factoring arrangement with Getinge:
• “Under this program, TSO3 may factor up to 100% of the outstanding receivables that Getinge posts to the program in exchange for a 


small discount.”
• “We anticipate substantially all Getinge receivables will flow through this program”
• “Payment terms for Getinge under this structure are 90 days from invoice date, rather than standard 45 day terms.”


 Spruce Point exercises significant skepticism here:
• Why does Getinge not disclose this program (or programs of similar arrangements with other partners) in its financial filings?
• Why does a large multinational corporation such as Getinge need to extend payment terms to TSO3?
• Why go through the effort of arranging this program given how small the financial amounts actually are
• If you’re TOS, why take a discount on the receivable when there’s no obvious liquidity need for accelerated cash flow

Canadian analysts have a resounding “Buy” endorsement on TSO3 and somehow turn a blind eye to many signs 
that its product Is likely to fail (yet again) and disappoint lofty expectations. Analysts entice investors with an 


expected 90% upside from its current price, but Spruce Point believes >80% downside is more likely.

Disappointment Looms Large


In the best case, TSO3 continues receiving orders from Getinge over the 5 year life of the agreement that ends in 2020, 
in which case sales continue to grow, but even this case we don’t believe TSO3 turns a profit. As the table below 


shows, TSO3 has shown zero earnings leverage to rising sales. We believe investors are underestimating the scenario 
where Getinge stops buying the VP4 due to public awareness that suggests its inability to sell through. 


If Getinge ceases purchases, then TSO3’s sales collapse and EPS remains negative.

Relative Valuation


Spruce Point believes that investors wanting exposure to the sterilization and infection control market are better 
served by avoiding TSO3 and instead investing in a combination of Steris and Getinge, which can be purchased at 


significantly cheaper valuations and offer dividends. TSO’s current valuation of nearly 15x sales and 19x book value 
discount nearly perfect execution of its business plan through 2020, which we believe is likely to sorely disappoint.

Strong Sell with 80%+ Downside Risk


Even in a best case scenario, TSO3 shareholders are likely to yield limited value by holding the stock until 
2020. Investors are underestimating the risk that TSO3 never turns a profit (even if its wildly optimistic 


revenue targets are hit) or that Getinge terminates its distribution agreement and sales plummet.

TSO3 FDA Filing Tables


TSO3 has no real competitive advantages over the incumbents, its own FDA filings confirm!


 A comparison of the STERIZONE VP4, STERRAD 100NX, and STERIS V-PRO maX was provided to the FDA in December 2014 
in this filing.  According to the FDA filing, "the STERIZONE® VP4 Sterilizer is substantially equivalent to the STERRAD® 
100NX® Sterilizer (K111377) and to the Amsco®V-PRO® maX Low Temperature Sterilization System (K131120) with respect 
to intended use, mode of action, performance and safety characteristics."

Marketing gimmicks won’t displace the larger, better funded and better capitalized J&J / Steris


TSO3 FDA Filing Tables (cont’d)


 Tables 4 and 5 from the FDA Filing confirms that all three machines rely on low temperature hydrogen peroxide 
sterilization.  In the opinion of industry observers, the ozone isn't a key differentiator, just marketing spin.  A blog by 
chemDAQ Incorporated, which produces gas detection systems for these sterilizers, confirms that "the VP4 is primarily a 
hydrogen peroxide sterilizer similar to the Steris V-Pro and ASP's Sterrad line of sterilizers." and that the plasma and ozone 
is unlikely to have much effect.  And, in terms of cycle time, chemDAQ points out that TSO3's VP4 sterilizer cycle time of 46
minutes (minimum) is not as short as the STERRAD NX's 24 minute cycle time.
