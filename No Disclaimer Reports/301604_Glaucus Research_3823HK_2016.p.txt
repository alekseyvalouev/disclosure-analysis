Tech Pro Technology Development Limited (HK: 3823) (“Tech Pro” or the “Company”) is a roll-


up of unrelated businesses: it manufactures and sells LED lighting products, it is a sub-leasing agent 


for a commercial real estate property in Shanghai, and it recently purchased a French soccer team.     





In this report we present publicly available SAIC filings, which, in our opinion, indicate that Tech 


Pro has massively overstated its reported profits and inflated the reported purchase price of its 


acquisitions.  We believe that Tech Pro is an obvious fraud, that its equity is worth HKD 0.00 and 


trading of its stock should be halted to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully 


provide a modicum of recovery for shareholders and creditors. 
  
1. Fabricated Financial Performance of Shanghai Fuchao.  In 2014 and 2015, Tech Pro 


reported that Shanghai Fuchao Property Management Company Limited (“Shanghai Fuchao”), 


a sub-leasing agent for a commercial real estate property in Shanghai, generated cumulative net 


profits of RMB 60.9 million, making Shanghai Fuchao its most profitable business segment and 


its most valuable asset.  In aggregate, Tech Pro claims that Shanghai Fuchao generated net 


profits of RMB 190 million from 2011 through 2015, and retained a net asset balance of RMB 


733 million as of FYE 2015.  However, financial statements contained within SAIC filings 


indicate that Shanghai Fuchao’s cumulative profits were 99% less than reported from 


2011-2015 and its net asset balance was 99% less than reported as of FYE 2015.  In our 


opinion, this is clear and convincing evidence that Tech Pro has lied about financial 


performance of its most profitable business segment and its most valuable asset. 





2. Fabricated Purchase Price of Shanghai Fuchao.  On November 27, 2013, Tech Pro 
announced its intent to purchase 50% of Shanghai Fuchao for a total consideration of HKD 450 


million.  However, SAIC filings of Shanghai Fuchao reveal that the actual purchase price was 


only RMB 4.5 million, 99% less than Tech Pro claimed.  We believe that this is clear and 


undeniable evidence that Tech Pro massively inflated the purchase price of its acquisition and 


thereby blatantly violated Hong Kong securities laws. 





3. LED Businesses: Fabricated Profitability of Acquired Subsidiaries.  In 2011, Tech Pro 
acquired five LED related businesses for a total consideration of RMB 781 million.  Each 


acquisition included a profit guarantee for the first twelve-months post-acquisition, to reassure 


investors that Tech Pro’s acquisition binge was a responsible investment.  Tech Pro reported 


that the five LED businesses generated profits of RMB 98 million in the first twelve-months 


post-acquisition. However, SAIC filings for four acquired LED businesses reveal that actual 


profits during the twelve-month minimum guaranteed performance period were 100% 


less than Tech Pro reported.   In our view, this is further evidence that Tech Pro defrauded 


investors and is another clear violation of Hong Kong Securities Law.

a. Shine Link.  On June 20, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 100% of Shine Link Technology 
(“Shine Link”), which has one PRC operating subsidiary, U Young (Xiamen) Light Electrical Technology 


Limited (“U Young”), for a total consideration of RMB 177.5 million.  Tech Pro subsequently reported that 


Shine Link generated profits of RMB 14.6 million in the first twelve-months post-acquisition. However, SAIC 


filings reveal that in the two years from 2011 through 2012, U Young generated 88% less revenues than Tech 


Pro claimed and rather than turn a profit, generated a cumulative net loss of RMB -3.5 million.  In our 


opinion, SAIC filings indicate that Tech Pro lied to investors about the financial performance of the acquired 


business.   





b. Kings Honor.   On July 7, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 60% of Kings Honor Technology 
(“Kings Honor”) which owns 95% of one PRC operating subsidiary, Jiangxi Lantian Wei Guang Technology 


Company Limited (“Wei Guang”), for a total consideration of RMB 127.1 million.  Tech Pro reported that Kings 


Honor generated RMB 26.3 million in profits in the first twelve-months post-acquisition.  However, SAIC filings 


reveal that in the two years from 2011 through 2012, Wei Guang generated only RMB 4.3 million in profits, 


84% less than Tech Pro reported. We believe that Wei Guang’s SAIC filings clearly indicate that Kings Honor 


was far less profitable than Tech Pro claimed. 





c. Pacific King.  On August 24, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 60% of Pacific King Technology 
(“Pacific King”), which owns 100% of the PRC operating business Shenzhen Chong Zheng Electronic 


Technology Limited (“Chong Zheng”), for a total consideration of RMB 107.7 million.  Tech Pro reported that 


Pacific King generated a profit of RMB 21 million its first twelve-months post-acquisition.  However, SAIC 


filings reveal that in the two years from 2011 to 2012, Chong Zheng generated only RMB 171,000 in profits 


before tax, 99% less than Tech Pro reported.  We believe that, similar to Tech Pro’s other LED acquisitions, 


SAIC filings clearly indicate that Pacific King was far less profitable than Tech Pro claimed.  





d. Giga-World.  On January 24, 2011 Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 50% of Giga-World Industry 
(“Giga-World”), which owns 100% of the PRC operating business Shenzhen Wind and Solar New Energy 


Company Limited (“Shenzhen Wind and Solar”), for a total consideration of RMB 243.6 million. Tech Pro 


reported that Giga-World generated RMB 19 million in profits from February 2011 through January 2012.  


However, SAIC filings reveal that rather than generating profits in its first twelve-months post-acquisition, 


Shenzhen Wind and Solar actually lost money.  We believe that, similar to Tech Pro’s other LED acquisitions, 


SAIC filings clearly indicate that Giga-World was far less profitable than Tech Pro claimed. 





4. Valuation.   Tech Pro is no stranger to controversy.  In March 2016, the Wall Street Journal questioned Tech Pro’s rising 
stock price, highlighting that the Company’s shares seem to register a disproportionate amount of their gains in the last 


hour of trading.  The Wall Street Journal compared this pattern to Hanergy, whose stock price collapsed amid accusations 


of fraud and market manipulation.  The Wall Street Journal was right to caution investors.   In this report we present 


publicly available SAIC filings for Tech Pro’s acquisitions, which, in our opinion, indicate that Tech Pro has massively 


overstated its reported profits and inflated the purchase price of its acquisitions.  We believe that Tech Pro is an obvious 


fraud, that its equity is worth HKD 0.00 and trading of its stock should be halted to protect future investors from further 


losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery for shareholders and creditors.

FABRICATED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND PURCHASE PRICE FOR SHANGHAI FUCHAO 





Tech Pro is a roll-up of unrelated businesses: it manufactures and sells LED lighting products, it is a sub-leasing agent 


for a commercial real estate property in Shanghai, and it recently purchased a French soccer team. However, in the 


last two fiscal years, only the property management business reportedly generated a profit. 





 
Source:  Tech Pro FY 2015 Annual Report, p. 79, 80 


Note: Excludes one-time gain on bargain purchase for French soccer team 





We believe that Tech Pro’s reported profitability is a lie. 





1) Fabrication of Financial Performance 
 


On November 27, 2013, Tech Pro announced its intent to purchase 50% of Shanghai Fuchao for a total consideration 


of HKD 450 million (RMB 351 million).  Shanghai Fuchao is principally engaged in the sub-leasing and management 


of tenants for a commercial real-estate property in Shanghai called Universal Mansion. 





In its acquisition announcement, Tech Pro released a summary of the audited historical financials for Shanghai Fuchao 


in 2011 and 2012. Most recently on June 3, 2016, Tech Pro agreed to buy the remaining 50% of Shanghai Fuchao for 


an additional HKD 461 million (~RMB 387 million).  In this announcement, Tech Pro released an unaudited summary 


of the financial performance of Shanghai Fuchao from 2013 through 2015.  





     
Sources: Tech Pro Announcement November 27, 2013  _  Tech Pro Announcement June 3, 2016 








In total, from 2011-2015, Tech Pro claimed that Shanghai Fuchao generated RMB 190 million in cumulative net 


profits, and maintained a net asset balance that exceeded RMB 733 million by year-end 2015.1 However, financial 


statements contained within Shanghai Fuchao’s SAIC filings indicate that Shanghai Fuchao’s cumulative profits 


were 99% less than reported from 2011-2015 and that its net asset balance was 99% less than reported as of 


FYE 2015.

Note that Shanghai Fuchao’s SAIC financials are consistent with its role as a sub-leasing agent.  Tech Pro reported 


that Shanghai Fuchao generated steady revenues of RMB 55.3 million and RMB 56.9 million in 2014 and 2015, 


respectively.  When we checked the rental prices for per square meter for Universal Mansion and other nearby 


commercial real estate properties we calculated that, assuming 99% occupancy, the property could expect to generate 


rental income of RMB 55+ million annually.2  The problem is that Tech Pro’s reported revenues from Universal 


Mansion are consistent with what we would expect the owner of the building to earn.  





But Tech Pro, as it admits, is only the sub-leasing agent of Universal Mansion. The building is actually owned3 by 


the Logistics Department of the Chinese People’s Armed Police Force (中國人民武裝警察部隊後勤部), which 
contracts with Shanghai Fuchao the right to manage the property.  It is common sense that the vast majority of the 


rental income goes to the property owner, and not the management company.   





Given that Shanghai Fuchao only manages one property, we would expect it to generate thin or negative margins 


because it cannot take advantage of any economies of scale in the property management business. This is exactly what 


SAIC filings show.  


 
Source: Photos of Universal Mansion 





In our opinion, SAIC filings clearly indicate that Tech Pro fabricated the financial performance of Shanghai Fuchao 


pre and post-acquisition.  Additionally, SAIC filings reveal that the actual consideration for 50% of Shanghai Fuchao 


was 99% less than Tech Pro claimed, which we believe is evidence of another blatant violation of Hong Kong 


securities laws.

2) Fabricated Purchase Price 
 


On November 27, 2013, Tech Pro announced its intent to purchase 50% of Shanghai Fuchao for HKD 450 million 


(RMB 351 million).  In its 2014 annual report, Tech Pro confirmed that it completed the acquisition of 50% of 


Shanghai Fuchao for a total consideration of HKD 424.5 million (RMB 336 million),4 HKD 40 million payable in 


cash and the remainder payable in stock and convertible debt. 





 
Source: Tech Pro 2014 Annual Report – p. 107 





However, publicly available SAIC filings indicate that Tech Pro massively inflated the purchase price of Shanghai 


Fuchao.  Specifically, SAIC files reveal that rather than paying RMB 336 million to the seller, Mr. Fan Lin, for 50% 


of Shanghai Fuchao, Tech Pro only paid RMB 4.5 million for its 50% equity interest!

In our opinion, it is clear from this equity transfer agreement in the Shanghai Fuchao SAIC files that Tech Pro lied 


about the purchase price and fabricated over RMB 330 million in acquisition expenses.  There is additional evidence 


to support this conclusion. 





In its acquisition announcement, Tech Pro explicitly claimed that the HKD450 million purchase price represented 


50% of the registered and paid-up capital of Shanghai Fuchao.   








 
Source: November 27, 2013 Tech Pro announcement 








However, SAIC filings show that Shanghai Fuchao only had registered capital of RMB 9 million in 2013 and 2014, 


further evidence that RMB 4.5 million was the actual purchase price for 50% of Shanghai Fuchao.

The good news is that regulators can still protect shareholders with swift and decisive action against Tech Pro. On 


June 3, 2016, Tech Pro announced its intent to purchase the remaining 50% from Mr. Fan Lin for a total consideration 


of RMB 387 million, but consideration for the remaining 50% equity interest has yet to be paid.  This allows Hong 


Kong Regulators to take preventative measures to halt this transaction and deny the registration and sale of shares 


issued as part of the consideration.  





We believe that the SAIC filings clearly indicate that Tech Pro fabricated the purchase price of its equity interest in 


Shanghai Fuchao.

LED BUSINESS: FABRICATED PROFITABILITY OF ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES 





In 2011, Tech Pro acquired five LED related businesses for a total consideration of RMB 781 million.  Each acquisition 


included a profit guarantee for the first twelve-months post-acquisition, reassuring investors that Tech Pro’s 


acquisition binge was a responsible investment and creating a sense of optimism about the future prospects of each 


acquired business. 








Tech Pro subsequently reported that the five LED businesses generated profits of RMB 98 million in the first twelve-


months post-acquisition.  





However, SAIC filings for four acquired LED businesses reveal that actual profits during the twelve-month 


minimum guaranteed performance period were 100% less than Tech Pro reported.

We believe that these SAIC filings provide definitive evidence that Tech Pro defrauded investors regarding its LED

On June 20, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 100% of Shine Link Technology (“Shine Link”) which 


had one PRC operating subsidiary, U Young (Xiamen) Light Electrical Technology Limited (“U Young”), for a total 


consideration of RMB 177.5 million.  Tech Pro reported that Shine Link generated cumulative revenues of RMB

Tech Pro tried to get investors comfortable with acquiring an unprofitable entity by structuring the acquisition to 


include a minimum profit guarantee in the first twelve-months post-acquisition.5 If Shine Link failed to generate RMB 


30 million in profits, Tech Pro told shareholders that the Company was entitled to lower the amount of consideration 


payable to the sellers in the transaction.   





On November 21, 2012, Tech Pro reported that although Shine Link fell short of its guaranteed minimum profit, Shine 


Link generated profits of RMB 14.6 million in the first twelve months of operations post-acquisition.  Upon later 


increasing its ownership from 70% to 100% in July 2013, Tech Pro reported audited figures for Shine Link for 2011 


and 2012.

Additionally, SAIC filings show that U Young generated a net loss of RMB -3.5 million in 2013 and a net loss of 


RMB -2.5 million in 2014.  SAIC filings indicate that it was not until 2015 that U Young achieved its first profitable 


year, even though it barely broke even.  This is a dismal return, by any measure, for a business that cost the Company 


RMB 177.5 million to purchase.

We think the conclusion is obvious.  In our opinion, SAIC filings indicate that Tech Pro lied to investors about the 


financial performance of the acquired business.  





2) Kings Honor: Fabricated Post-Acquisition Profitability 
 


On July 7, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 60% of Kings Honor Technology (“Kings Honor”) which 


owns 95% of one PRC operating subsidiary, Jiangxi Lantian Wei Guang Technology Company Limited (“Wei 


Guang”) for a total consideration of RMB 127.1 million.6  Similar to its other acquired LED businesses, Tech Pro told 


shareholders that the deal came with a guaranteed profit of RMB 25 million in the first twelve-months post-acquisition. 





On November 21, 2012, Tech Pro reported that Kings Honor generated profits of RMB 26.3 million for the first 


twelve-months post-acquisition, surpassing its guaranteed profit amount.  





However, SAIC filings reveal that in the twenty-four months from 2011 through 2012, Wei Guang generated only 


RMB 4.3 million in profits, 84% less than Tech Pro reported to investors.

SAIC files also show that Wei Guang’s revenues, profits, and assets have all contracted significantly since 2012.  From 


2013 through 2015 Wei Guang generated a net loss of RMB -405,000.  Tech Pro paid RMB 127.1 million to acquire 


60% of a money-losing business whose total assets, revenues and profits steadily declined since 2012, Tech Pro’s first

We believe that Wei Guang’s SAIC filings clearly indicate that Tech Pro fabricated Kings Honor’s post-acquisition 


profitability.  SAIC filings reveal another failing LED acquisition which continues to lose money despite the fact that 


Tech Pro supposedly purchased a 60% interest in the business for RMB 127.1 million. 





3) Pacific King: Fabricated Post-Acquisition Profitability 
 


On August 24, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 60% of Pacific King Technology (“Pacific King”), 


which owns 100% of the PRC operating business Shenzhen Chong Zheng Electronic Technology Limited (“Chong 


Zheng”) for a total consideration of RMB 107.7 million.  As part of the deal, Pacific King guaranteed that it would 


generate profits of RMB 20 million in the first twelve-months post-acquisition, creating optimism and confidence for 


investors in the future prospects of Chong Zheng.  





On February 19, 2013, Tech Pro reported that Pacific King generated a profit of RMB 21 million in the first twelve-


months post-acquisition.   





However, SAIC filings reveal that in the two years from 2011 to 2012, Chong Zheng generated only RMB 171,000 


in profits before tax, 99% less than Tech Pro reported in its Hong Kong filings.

The pattern should now be obvious. We believe that Chong Zheng’s SAIC filings clearly indicate that Pacific King 


was far less profitable than Tech Pro claimed.  In our opinion, Tech Pro inflated the purchase price of another failing 


LED manufacturer and violated Hong Kong’s securities laws by fabricating the financial performance of the business 


post-acquisition.

On January 24, 2011, Tech Pro entered an agreement to purchase 50% of Giga-World Industry (“Giga-World”), which 


owns 100% of the PRC operating business Shenzhen Wind and Solar New Energy Company Limited (“Shenzhen 


Wind and Solar”) for a total consideration of RMB 243.6 million.  In its announcement, Tech Pro reported Giga-


World’s historical financial performance from 2008 through 2010.   








 
Source: Tech Pro Announcement January 24, 2011,  p. 9 











Tech Pro claimed that Giga-World generated an average annual net profit margin of 8.3% in the three years from 2008 


to 2010.7  However, in its 2011 annual report, Tech Pro reported that Giga-World achieved a remarkable 49.94% post-


tax net income margin.8   





Tech Pro claimed that Giga-World generated RMB 19 million in profits from February 1, 2011 through January 31, 


2012. However, SAIC filings reveal that rather than generate a profit in its first twelve-months post-acquisition, 


Shenzhen Wind and Solar actually lost money.

Additionally, Tech Pro disclosed in its 2014 annual report that it increased its ownership of Giga-World by another 


10% for HKD 20 million, bringing its ownership to 60%.9  





However, SAIC filings show that Shenzhen Wind and Solar failed to generate any profit in 2013.  Indeed, SAIC 


filings show that the LED business failed to turn a profit, generating a cumulative loss of RMB -2.15 million from 


2011 through 2015.   This appears to be another example where Tech Pro massively overpaid for a failing LED 


business, only to fabricate its post-acquisition profitability.

Based on the SAIC filings discussed in this report, we believe that Tech Pro fabricated the reported profitability of at 


least four out of five of its LED acquisitions.10  Whether Tech Pro deliberately overpaid for such acquisitions to funnel 


the public company’s money into the hands of friendly cohorts, or simply overstated the acquisition price to mask 


fabricated reported profits, we are unsure.  But, in our opinion, SAIC filings make it crystal clear that Tech Pro 


massively overpaid for four failing or barely profitable businesses, and that Tech Pro fabricated their post-acquisition 


profitability. 





VALUATION 





Tech Pro is no stranger to controversy.  On March 11, 2016, the Wall Street Journal reported a suspicious pattern in 


the trading of its stock. “Over the past year through March 9, Tech Pro’s stock returned 43%.  But if an investor had 


bought shares an hour before trading closed, sold them at the end of Hong Kong’s trading session, and then reinvested 


the proceeds the next day in the same manner, the return would be a remarkably high 791%.”  





The Wall St journal compared this pattern to Hanergy, whose stock price collapsed amid accusations of fraud and 


market manipulation.  The Wall Street Journal wrote that a “shadow” hangs over Tech Pro’s stock.  We agree. 





In this report we presented publicly available SAIC filings for Tech Pro’s acquisitions, which, in our opinion, indicate 


that Tech Pro has massively overstated its reported profits and inflated the reported purchase price of its acquisitions.  


We believe that Tech Pro is an obvious fraud, that its equity is worth HKD 0.00 and trading of its stock should be 


halted to protect future investors from further losses and hopefully provide a modicum of recovery for shareholders 


and creditors. 














                                                             
10 We could obtain only partial SAIC files for the fifth LED acquisition, Starry View and Mega Wide, but given Tech Pro’s 


pattern of behavior with the other LED subsidiaries and Shanghai Fuchao, we doubt Tech Pro’s claims regarding its 


profitability.
