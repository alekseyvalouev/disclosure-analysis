Top Chinese NASDAQ Official’s Resignation
Raises Questions about Its Disclosures.


Posted on December 22, 2009 by Asensio.com


On May 22, 2009 a spokesperson for the NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc.


(NASDAQ: NDAQ $19.59) said that its chief representative and


managing director in China, Guangxun Xu, “left” the company,


according to Reuters.


NASDAQ, formerly a subsidiary of the Financial Industry


Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), has not made additional


disclosures concerning Xu’s departure.


Serious questions about Xu are raised by his repeated on-again, off-


again NASDAQ employment history, his use of NASDAQ’s brand for


his private company engaged in financial advisory, his connection


to questionable stock-promoter Benjamin Wey, and details


contained in SEC filings for at least two Chinese reverse mergers.


These concerns existed prior to Xu’s sudden departure. Yet all that


has been disclosed is that Xu “left” the company.


There has been no public indication of any action by NASDAQ or


FINRA to protect investors or conduct an investigation of the


circumstances under which Xu “left” the company. FINRA is the


regulator overseeing the NASDAQ.


On May 4, 2009 asensio.com informed NASDAQ’s chief listing


compliance official, Gary Sundick, head of the listing investigations


department, of certain NASDAQ deficiencies in protecting investors,


most recently from misconduct related to Chinese reverse mergers


and of certain concerns about its handling of the Pegasus Wireless


stock fraud. (See the accompanying report “NASDAQ’s conduct in


Pegasus and Xu raise questions about its integrity.”)


Sundick is responsible for overseeing listing compliance, including


for Chinese reverse mergers that trade on NASDAQ, such as China

Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI $21.68). Sky See asensio.com


reports on CSKI.


Within weeks after the conversation with Sundick, on May 22, 2009,


NASDAQ confirmed that Xu had left the company.


A replacement for Xu was not announced until July 24, 2009, two


months after the announcement of Xu’s departure.


Xu worked for NASDAQ in China for 10 years, from 1994 until


NASDAQ closed its China office in 2004. NASDAQ reopened its China


office in 2007 and then rehired Xu to work as chief representative


in China. 


While NASDAQ’s China office was closed, Xu operated his own


advisory firm called NASDAQ Listing Services Limited that


specialized in advising “Chinese companies on US and UK listings.”


We found neither a disclosure of an agreement between NASDAQ


and Xu granting Xu the right to use the NASDAQ brand for a listings


advisory firm, nor any FINRA rule allowing an exchange to enter


into an agreement that would allow the transfer of any of its listing


qualifications responsibility to an unregistered third party.


From July 2006 to May 2007, Xu served on the board of a NASDAQ-


listed Chinese reverse merger, China Automotive Systems, Inc.


(NASDAQ: CAAS, $20.43), until he resumed employment with


NASDAQ.


An CAAS Form 3 filed shows Xu having a UK address in Finchley,


London.


Finchley International Investments Ltd. sold 103,200 shares of


Bodisen Biotech, Inc. (OTC: BBCZ $0.24) for $2.064 million in


February 2006, according to an SEC-filed Form 144.


See a separate report on Bodisen, stock promoter Benjamin Wey,


and Wey’s connection to Xu. Click here to read the asensio.com


report titled “Bodisen and Wey’s Connections to NASDAQ’s Chinese


Reverse Merger Mill Exposed.”


NASDAQ failed to take action on the concerns raised by asensio.com


related to Chinese reverse mergers and Xu. The separate report on


NASDAQ issued today speaks of conflicts-of-interest NASDAQ may


face in ensuring listings compliance. Click here to read the


asensio.com report titled “NASDAQ’s Conflicts in Pegasus and Xu


Raise Questions About Its Regulatory Reliability.”


Given the problematic nature of expecting NASDAQ to protect


investors from harm, asensio.com then raised the issue of Xu’s


departure and NASDAQ oversight problems to a senior official at


FINRA.
