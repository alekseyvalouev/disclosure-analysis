Has the Halo Been Broken on Intuitive Surgical ? 
 
While Wall Street Sleeps, Citron Notes This Wall Street Darling 
has Passed the Tipping Point  
 
Citron believes $350 is coming …. "for now".  18-month target:  $250.   
 


  Overview 
Citron examines a company desperately trying to keep up its "market darling" reputation 
on Wall Street.    
 
But the high earnings multiple conferred on Intuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) does not 
align with: 


 a track record of excessive and unjustified marketing claims 
 the utter lack of clinical evidence of superior medical outcomes when using its 


product for surgery, and  
 the gathering storm of legal liability accruing to the company due to its failure to 


adequately disclose risks prior to its technology causing adverse surgical outcomes, 
scattered among the hundreds of thousands of surgeries performed with its robotic 
surgery devices.  


 
Over the past few months, Citron has been compiling information about the marketing 
practices of Intuitive Surgical, but just within the past month, a number of new and 
decisive data points have emerged that Wall Street has not noted, which we thought 
justified calling out immediately.    This is not the first time Citron has written on a medical 
technology company or a medical company whose revenues are materially dependent on 
insurance companies' reimbursement procedures and policies.

(NOTE:   All of these stories are posted in CitronResearch.com archives. ) 
 
What two circumstances do these businesses all have in common?   
 


1)  All four of these stocks fell by 50% to 90% since the date Citron first identified the 
critical structural problems in their business models.   In each case, the point was 
not the knee-jerk response of the stock in the minutes, hours or days following 
publication, it was the investment thesis being proven right in the course of 
time.  


2) Each of these companies is dependent upon a business model which relies on 
distorting the medical coding and insurance reimbursement system to earn the 
preponderance of its revenues or generate its growth.    


 
Inuitive Surgical (ISRG) is unique because the da Vinci is a product that has not been sold to 
meet patient need, as most medical devices are, but rather it has been sold using fear to 
hospital management purchasing committees.  Aggressive salespeople have escalated a 
“medical arms race” into high technology, regardless of whether surgeries with this device 
produce significant medical benefit or not.
Citron Research reports on Intuitive Surgical:  December 19, 2012  Page 3 of 18 
 


Medicine for profit over utility is not an uncommon theme, but 
now the lawyers have taken notice – and investors should take 
note as well. 
 
It is Citron's opinion that Intuitive Surgical has reached exactly this tipping point.  
Not a tipping point which will put the company out of business, but rather a tipping 
point that could break the halo and have Wall Street assign a comparable multiple to 
other mainstream medical device companies… that could take this stock down 50%. 
 
Here are the new data points of the last four weeks: 


 Three new highly credible lawsuits over hysterectomies with bad outcomes have 
been filed – in addition to six really ominous ones from earlier in the year 


 Large insider sales.  Within the last month, Chairman Lonnie Smith sold shares from 
options exercise (not 10(5)b) netting over $50 million, a rather large percentage 
of his recently apportioned stake  


 Peer criticism – a number of recent articles summarizing from highly credible, 
recent studies that highlight the gap between the company marketing materials' 
claims and full scientific disclosure of the true risks and differentials in medical 
outcomes.  This gap creates the basis for legal challenges to the company due to 
inadequate disclosure of the risks of bad outcomes.   


 Further skepticism about the true cost/benefit of robotic surgeries  
 Indications of loss of morale and sharp erosion of confidence in management and 


oversaturation coming through the sales force  
 
But the most serious issue facing Intuitive is that while its deployment is well past the 10 


year point into mainstream healthcare in the US, there is still a severe vacuum of real 
scientific evidence that the da Vinci is of any clinical benefit when the 
full arc of costs and outcomes are weighed, in the most commonly performed 
surgeries in which it is utilized.  While this is not a new thought, the current legal cases will 
bring this issue to the forefront.   
 


  Background 
Intuitive Surgical,  (NASDAQ:ISRG) is the market leader in robotic-controlled surgery 
devices.  The company sports a $22 billion market cap with 99% of the stock in the float.  
It manufactures a very futuristic technology, a so-called robotic surgery system.  The da 
Vinci is a $1.5 - $2.5 million-dollar machine that allows a surgeon to operate on a patient 
from a control console, manipulating a suite of tiny computer-assisted remote control tools 
through a small tube inside a patient, reproducing tiny and precise movements with tools 
at the surgical site which could not be performed otherwise.  
 
The apparent advantages of such types of surgery were really easy for patients and 
investors alike to comprehend:  much smaller incisions, the presumption of faster and less 
painful healing from surgery, and shorter hospital stays.   Intuitive enjoyed strategic first

Citron Research reports on Intuitive Surgical:  December 19, 2012  Page 4 of 18 
 


mover advantage in the US, and for several years the company's sales force made 
persuasive headway with the nation's hospitals, convincing their purchasing committees to 
commit to purchasing these expensive machines, because they would be absolutely 
necessary to compete in the modern age of medicine.   
 
Intuitive's sales team was able to convince many hospital purchasing committees that they 
needed this technology to "compete" for patients.  Sales soared, and with them, 
expectations of a growing number of new procedures would increase revenues of the 
razor-blade model for single-use kits, wider training of surgeons in its use, and an ever 
expanding market to capitalize on its first-mover advantage.  This has all worked out 
happily for investors, with Intuitive's stock growing 20 fold over levels a decade ago. 
 
Superficially, the da Vinci offers so much of the 'wow factor' it is all too easy for business 
judgment to wilt before visions of surgical robots as pure medical magic, inspiring 
investors to leap to the conclusion that da Vinci is the future of all surgery, and lose focus 
on the nuts and bolts of basic business discipline.   In doing this, the market has looked past 
the glaring vulnerabilities of Intuitive Surgical's business model.  
 
For Intuitive, growing its business is a complex process; not only does it face a long sales 
cycle for the most expensive single piece of equipment in a typical hospital's surgery suite, 
but each type of surgery the equipment is used on is really a separate market:  it requires 
its own specialized tools to attach to the robot, separate FDA approvals for the entire 
procedure plus the attachments, and specific training for the surgeons already expert in 
performing it without the robot.   And only then does the monetization challenge kick in:  
how to code the procedures so medical insurance companies will reimburse the higher 
costs, especially without new reimbursement codes, which would require scientific 
justification of the higher cost procedure.  
 
So far, it has breeched just two high-volume surgeries which comprise the vast majority of 
procedures it is used for:  prostate surgeries and hysterectomies (over 31% and 40% of da 
Vinci procedures in 2011, respectively) .   Ironically, the latter is an extremely common and 
not difficult laparoscopic surgery with non-robotic tools.  The safety concerns now 
appearing in civil lawsuits cause a reasonable question as to whether the da Vinci is all too 
often, a solution looking for a problem.  
 
Meanwhile sixteen analysts cover Intuitive Surgical.   They all have neat little spreadsheets 
multiplying last quarter's numbers by their carefully calculated growth trajectory rates to 
calculate next quarter's "profit model", etc.  But their models seem unable to detect the real 
storm clouds gathering for the company.

  Hysterectomies:   
The Documents the Company Doesn't Want You to See  
 
(One patient's intestines were hanging out of her vagina; 
another was uncontrollably passing urine out of her vagina, 
while two "routine" hysterectomies resulted in death of the 
patient, with apparent damage caused by the da Vinci device) 
 
Hysterectomies are now da Vinci's single highest volume application.  But within the last 
month, three new separate lawsuits have been filed on behalf of defendants upon whom 
gynecological surgery was performed, with disastrous results.   This is on top of six others 
filed earlier in 2012.  Here are the major similarities in numerous cases filed so far: 
 


 Filed in 2012  
 Hysterectomy/Gynecology bad outcomes (One was a heart valve procedure)  
 Long-lasting medical consequences 
 Filed by credible attorneys, not by class-action-troll firms 
 Surgeons in these cases are not named defendants 
 Product marketing claims of Intuitive Surgical cited as misleading in every case 
 Intuitive Surgical accused of failure to disclose accurately the risks of use of its 


device 
 Excessive, deceptive and manipulative marketing practices a foundation of damage 


claims  
 Burns resulting from unintended electrical discharge; damaged insulation and/or  
 Unintended tissue damage, tears and other tissue impacts

    The Most Disturbing Lawsuit Ever: 
 


"Prostatectomy Patient Who Urinated Out of His Rectum and 
Defecated Out of His Penis Suing Robot Maker" 
 
"The surgeon, Christopher Kopp, MD, said in his operative report that the robot 
malfunctioned several times. When he and the technicians couldn't get it working 
properly, he decided to convert to an open procedure." 


Outpatient Surgery, February 2011

urinated-out-of-his-rectum-and-defecated-out-of-his-penis-suing-robot-maker  
 
These patients all required debilitating and painful subsequent surgeries to repair defects 
caused by the original robotic surgery, and aside from the two patients who died, the 
remaining patients were left with severe long term adverse results.

Investors need to be aware that these cases are different than many cases in the past.  First, 
the company is the sole named defendant in these cases, not a co-defendant with the 
doctor.  With three new lawsuits filed in just the last month, attorneys are starting to focus 
culpability on the device maker rather than the doctor.  This shift in legal responsibility 
differs from the pattern of asserted liability over past years.  Secondly, the language in 
many of these suits is identical -- thereby suggesting strongly to Citron that a major class 
action case led by one of these attorneys is in the offing. 
 
In particular, one of the suits, filed last week in California court, is being prosecuted by 
Mark Geragos, a high profile California litigator who we are sure will not be shy in stirring 
up plenty of publicity about the matter.   Another three cases filed this year are filed by 
"tort king" Daniel Becnel – read about him here:  
http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/10_23/b4181066654108.htm 
 
These two gentlemen will make full use of the discovery phase of their lawsuits to expose 
all of the secrets behind the aggressive and inappropriate marketing methods used by 
Intuitive Surgical.  Look how industry publications describe company marketing materials 
and photos being displayed widely on hospital websites to tout da Vinci surgeries, rather 
than clinical data studying outcomes, to induce patients to seek out robotic surgery.    
 


  Consequences of Litigation Risk 
 
A future potential negative catalyst for Intuitive Surgical could soon emerge in a 
requirement that patients sign a letter of informed consent before receiving robotic 
assisted surgery.   Whether it be the hospitals, lawyers, doctors, or insurance companies -- 
the risks have become too great for patients not to be informed.  Every lawsuit that gets 
filed brings us one step closer to this necessary patient informed consent to be 
implemented.    
 
Patients must be informed about the true risks /benefits, and more importantly the skill 
level of the attending surgeon, when undergoing surgery using da Vinci machines.  
http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Informed+Consent 
 
The overall impacts upon utilization rates for da Vinci machines is difficult to predict, but it 
is Citron's opinion that the days of hospitals "competing" for patients by touting robotic 
surgery are rapidly coming to a close.  
 
 
Instead of boring you with article after article, Citron excerpts the most relevant quotes of 
noted experts and medical journals in their respective fields, about this cluster of issues:

Citron is amazed that it has taken so long for the legal community to catch up to the 


medical community. It is totally inexplicable that, despite the intense marketing hype 


generated by a company with a $2 billion revenue run rate, there is still no clinical 


evidence of better medical outcomes for surgeries performed with its devices. 








"Out of all the instruments and surgical tools that hospitals have adopted, 
this is one of the most expensive items in American operating rooms today,"  
 
"It's a symbol of what's wrong with American health care: the widespread 
adoption of expensive new technology with little evidence to support its use 
— all within the context of a poorly informed, even misinformed, public."

  Benefits Often Not Supported by the Science 


 
Beyond the lawsuits, data is piling up that robotic hysterectomies are yielding outcomes no 
better than conventional laparoscopic surgeries, yet with consistently higher costs.   
 








From the Journal of Minimally Invasive Gynecology 


"Our findings reveal little clinical differences in perioperative and postoperative 
events.  This, coupled with the increased per-case hospital cost of the robot, 
suggests that further investigation is warranted when considering this 
technology for routine laparoscopic hysterectomies."

"In Medicine, Falling for Fake Innovation" – New York Times  
 





  Intuitive Surgical got their prostate checked -- and the results were 
not encouraging. 
 
The company's two highest-volume procedures are by far prostate surgeries and 
hysterectomies (over 31% and 40% of da Vinci procedures in 2011, respectively).   Let's 
look at the factors in play with these primary uses of da Vinci.   


 
The first sign of real operational results problems surfaced in the last quarter when use of 
Intuitive's equipment for prostate surgeries suddenly and unexpectedly lost its sharp 
uptrend.   Interestingly, the problem is not competitors, but rather competing with "doing 
nothing".  Studies, most specifically, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, 
(http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1113162 )  now conclude that for many 
prostate cancers, the surgical outcomes are little to no better statistically than no 
treatment at all.  These studies were of immediate impact in terms of decrease in use of da 
Vinci.   
 
All other things being equal, this quarter's decline in prostate procedures would have been 
devastating for investors.  After all, prostate surgery was really the flagship condition that 
drove da Vinci sales for years.  But the company stated that other procedures (of which 
the vast majority would be hysterectomies) made up the difference in revenues and 
profits.  And we know what the result of pushing hysterectomies down the food chain will 
be:  more marginal cases, more marginally trained doctors, and an increased percentage of 
damaged outcomes.  
 


"The critics are right — if they’re talking about innovations like the da Vinci robot, 


which costs more than a million dollars and yet has never been shown by a 


randomized trial to improve the outcomes of prostate surgery. Indeed, a 2009 


study showed that while patients had shorter hospital stays and fewer surgical 


complications like blood loss when they underwent this kind of robotic surgery, 


they later “experienced more … incontinence and erectile dysfunction".

  Dissention in the Ranks: 
 
The stresses of maintaining a high growth company while fighting insurance companies 
and medicine are evident on the popular employee message board CafePharma, which is a 
must read for everyone in pharmaceutical and medical device world. 
 
After reading this board, Citron is of the opinion that the sentiment of the employees is a 
canary in the mine for a company with an oversaturated sales channel. 
 


"Expect 2 to 3 calls per day (yes day) asking you about your number and how many cases you 
are bringing in. If a surgeon takes vacation or doesn’t schedule 3 hysterectomies in his/her 
block or if a case gets cancelled you better have a good explanation for it." 


"Wow. Started with the company 3 years ago and this post is dead on accurate. " 


"I am training a doc now who did 18 hysterectomies last year because I'm doing everything and 
anything to try and hit my unrealistic number set by my CSM and CSD." 


"I, too, have never posted. I agree with everything above. Micromanage IS the culture….and 
recently I was "forced" out. Forced out due to reasons the above and that I would not lower my 
standards to talk to my docs into using the da Vinci for reasons that did not involve patient 
benefit." 


"I had the exact same experience while at Intuitive. I will never be able to fully explain why so 
many good people are pushed out???" 


"This one certainly caught my eye, and most of the information here is accurate. The company 
is not what it was 3 to 4 years ago, Intuitive has become a company motivated by greed and the 
posts about the management team’s fear culture is the truth. Reps today have an average of 3 
accounts to cover without enough to do, so we baby sit cases with surgeons who don’t need us 
there. I get asked every day “why are you hear I’ve done over 200 cases” The OR staff is sick of 
seeing us hanging around the OR all day and for the most part we are taking up space watching 
cases. Surgeons we have left to train are the bottom of the barrel with minimal surgical skill, 


"Conclusion:  Risks of problems with continence and sexual function are high 


after both procedures. Medicare-age men should not expect fewer adverse 


effects following robotic prostatectomy".

but we are left to train to “hit the buckets.” " 


"I heard that Steve Kroft of 60 minutes is trying to produce a special investigative report story 
on Intuitive. It was going to highlight the company's technology & the business tactics it uses 
against hospitals and employees to maintain growth.  
 
Does anybody have any insight to this?" 


"I heard that there are some disgruntled Dr's that are not happy with the stiff arming that 
Intuitive tries to pull when trying to convert easy lap cases over to da Vinci." 


"any sense of when this will be aired? It looks like there have been a lot of MAUDE issues lately" 
 
The posts are recent, consistent in perspective, and nobody is refuting them.

  Future Reporting 
There are a number of topics of ongoing investigatory work that Citron will provide 
updates on in coming weeks.  Among the interesting questions: 
 


1) What are reasonable estimates of reserves the company should be accruing against 
the estimated impacts of future litigation losses, and the impacts on company 
revenue projections?  


2) If the hysterectomy litigation goes to class-action status, what are the impacts for 
the company's profits?  


3) Exactly how does da Vinci surgery manage to get insurance reimbursement at 
higher rates than standard laparoscopic surgery?  Is this cost increment 
sustainable?   Will insurance companies continue to tolerate this higher rate of 
reimbursement structure without convincing clinical evidence of superior outcomes 
to justify the costs?  


4) What are the impacts of Obamacare on company revenues?  
5) What is the FDA's MAUDE and why should investors care about it, even though it's 


never been mentioned in a SEC filing or a conference call?   
6) Are there signs of under-utilization of da Vinci systems already purchased and 


installed in hospitals?  What does this say for the sustainability of Intuitive Surgical's 
future revenues?  


7) What level of training is really required to develop reliable levels of competence 
using da Vinci?  Why are there no real licensing standards?  We've seen doctors 
opine that it takes 300 surgeries to really feel confident in this modality.  Who will 
be the patients for all those in-training surgeries?   As the force for new sales drives 
more and more marginal surgeons into the pipeline, does the level of expertise 
decline?  Does the rate of bad outcomes rise?  


8) Are da Vinci's procedure counts being skewed, in light of sales commission policy to 
cast a blind eye on consumables being reported by the sales force as used on higher-
commission surgeries (other than hysterectomies)?

The Last Word on the Analysts:  


Meanwhile, Intuitive still enjoys "darling status":  a market cap that is 10x revenues, 


forward EPS over 30x, and a crowd of analysts drawing sloping lines upward to the sky.   


Citron is sure that every analyst who hears about this piece will be out with a note 


defending this stock before they even read the work, which is (18 pages, plus over 20 


links).  That seems to be standard practice for the sell side. In our 12 years of reporting 


with unparalleled accuracy, we have NEVER seen an analyst back away from a medical 


company we reported until after it is too late … and shareholders lose money:   Viva Wall 


Street!   For those who say that some of this report is old news we suggest you rethink.  Is 


this a scenario that occurred years ago, simply part of the company's past history, or are 


these data points that are only going to get worse, as the insatiable thirst for growth drives 


the company to push more novice surgeons to perform unnecessary robotic surgeries, with 


potentially dangerous outcomes?   





If this is the case, then this story is foretelling the future by understanding the past … -  


NOW THAT IS ANALYSIS! 








   Conclusion 
Circumstances are converging on Intuitive Surgical, and it is Citron's opinion that the stock 
is ripe for its own bad outcome – for investors.   The company achieved tremendous initial 
commercial success by selling its high-tech machinery into the surgical suites of the 
nation's hospitals.  But the primary motivation was marketing – the hospitals' fears that 
robot surgery would be demanded as the standard of care by patients when selecting 
medical care providers.   


 
Now several years have passed, with prostate surgery and hysterectomies being the bread-
and-butter of mainstream utilization da Vinci procedures.  All we know from all those 
outcomes is that they definitely cost the health care system more.  This cost was borne by 
insurance companies and passed on to all of us.  There is marginal data showing shorter 
hospital stays and less invasive surgical sites for the hysterectomies, but overall medical 
outcomes are no better.   And for prostate surgery, no treatment is looking competitive to 
any surgery at all with regard to outcomes.  
 
Citron is sure that in the hands of a really skilled surgeon, da Vinci can produce some 
favorable outcomes.  But the numbers don't show a decisive advantage, and the costs of 
litigating and compensating the victims of really bad outcomes hasn't even been factored in 
yet – those costs are uncovered later, and are just now beginning to surface.  
 
Downward vectors that should be considered by all investors are:
Citron Research reports on Intuitive Surgical:  December 19, 2012  Page 18 of 18 
 


 
 Reversion of this stock to realistic multiples for the top medical device companies  


 Reducing estimates to allow for the establishment of realistic legal loss reserves for the liability 
exposure for deceptive marketing, and patient injuries and damages 


 Reduction of estimates to account for the "saturation factor" in hysterectomies and the 
declining market for prostate surgery 





It is Citron's opinion that, considering all the facts as outlined above, one third to one half of 
Intuitive's Surgical's stock price could be excised.   For investors, that would be an 
operation without anesthetic.
