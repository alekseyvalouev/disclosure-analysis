Philips denies Universal Display’s
phosphorescent materials assertion.


Posted on November 27, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, November 27, 2013.  Before yesterday’s trading
commenced, Universal Display Corpora�on (“UDC;” NASDAQ:
OLED) released an announcement of a new “collabora�on” with
Philips sta�ng it was delighted with the “partnership with Philip.” 
Investors should agree that the below makes it blatantly obvious
that UDC’s announcement was unnecessary and misleading; that
it was intended to distract focus on the immediate
nega�ve significance of Friday’s groundbreaking court decision,
which has a nega�ve direct effect on its Samsung business. 
Otherwise the announcement is meaningless.


A representa�ve for Philips Technologie Gmb, the subsidiary of
HKoninklijke Philips NV in ques�on, presented with UDC’s
“collabora�on” or “partnership” claims, confirmed that the en�re
ma�er merely relates to UDC’s indica�on of interest in become
one of Philips exis�ng phosphorescent materials suppliers.


Contrary to UDC’s investor centric promo�on, UDC has no
blocking or pioneering OLED patent.


UDC’s only OLED phosphorescent materials patents that make be
remotely characterized as “blocking” were all consolidated into
EP238, which were invalida�ng in its totality in a legal
decision based on a “no inven�on” finding of fact that is not
appealable.  The legal standards used to make that “no inven�on”
determina�on exist in the US and other major jurisdic�ons.


Philips just like Samsung Mobile Display Co., Ltd., Motorola, HTC,
LG , Sony Ericsson,  Nokia Fossil Anwell Technologies Limited, AU
Optronics, Chimei Innolux Corpora�on,  DuPont, Shearwater

Research and other manufacturers of OLED display panel is free
to manufacture OLED products without any UDC involvement or
reliance on UDC’s phosphorescent materials.


UDC issued its “partnership” announcement under ques�onable
circumstances suspiciously �med to create or jus�fy a�ermarket
trading. UDC’s partnership claim is an obviously unnecessary
exaggerated misuse of Phiilps that has unfortunately created a
series of erroneous ar�cles.
