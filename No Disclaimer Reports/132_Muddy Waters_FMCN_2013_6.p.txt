MW Learned from John Hempton how to Catch FMCN in Another Lie 
 


This past September, research that John Hempton of Bronte Capital did on FMCN inspired us to 
do some more work ourselves.  This is the first time we have publicly discussed these findings, 
which provide additional evidence that FMCN is a long-standing fraud. 
 
As we detailed in our initial November 21, 2011 report, we believe FMCN engaged in a series of 
at least 21 acquisitions and disposals in order to produce fraudulent financials.  We saw a number 
of parallels to the Olympus (7733.JP) scandal, except that FMCN was even more brazen in its 
conduct.  In many cases, FMCN impaired the acquisitions to zero, and literally gave them away – 
usually back to the sellers.  In our opinion, the acquisitions were never bona fide – they were 
intended to either round-trip money that would come back in as revenue, or provide an excuse for 
FMCN’s low cash balances relative to its reported operating cash flows.  We also believe that 
FMCN disposed of the companies in order to keep them out of its auditor’s reach.   
 
One of the key findings in our initial report was that the purported acquisitions and disposals of 
six mobile phone advertising companies were frauds.  (See pp. 26-31.)  We had examined the 
corporate registries in China, and it turned out that FMCN never owned the companies.  We 
considered the possibility that FMCN could have purchased these companies through offshore 
indirect holding companies.  (This type of arrangement is called a Variable Interest Entity or 
VIE.)  For reasons we discussed in the initial report, it was clear that these companies were not 
FMCN VIEs. 
 
Yet, FMCN’s response – really the only thing FMCN could say short of a full admission – is that 
it did purchase those companies as VIEs.1  In its response, FMCN disclosed the purported BVI 
holding companies for the mobile phone companies.  Until a September 2012 post by John 
Hempton of Bronte Capital,2 we did no more research on these purported acquisitions because we 
had already established that they never happened.  (GeoInvesting had also called upon FMCN to 
disclose the WFOEs belonging to these BVI companies, which FMCN did not do. 3) 
 
Late last year, Hempton did some research in the BVI – mostly looking at the holding companies 
for other questionable acquisitions and disposals FMCN had undertaken.  He found four FMCN 
acquisitions – all from purportedly unrelated sellers – had been registered by the same corporate 
secretary in the BVI, Overseas Management Co.  As Hempton says, this is quite a coincidence, 
given the number of agents in BVI.   
 
One of Hempton’s Overseas Management discoveries involves Dongguan Yaya, which is also 
one of the mobile phone advertising companies we found FMCN never actually acquired.  As 
Hempton discovered, and we confirmed, the BVI company that FMCN says it acquired in order 
to give it VIE ownership of Yaya, Directvantage Ltd., was registered over four months after the 
acquisition supposedly occurred.  In other words, when FMCN responded to our report by saying 
that Yaya was a VIE controlled by Directvantage Ltd., FMCN was clearly lying.  Again.

Picking up the ball from Hempton, we pulled the registration records of the other five purported 
BVI holding companies for the mobile phone companies.  These acquisitions are also all 
supposed to be from unrelated sellers.  However, four of the five companies were also registered 
by Overseas Management.  The complete results are in the table below: 
 


 
 
Including Hempton’s research, that is now eight transactions that FMCN did with purportedly 
unrelated sellers in which Overseas Management registered the BVI companies.   
 
It should be obvious from the body of research MW, Hempton, and others have put forth that 
FMCN has been committing fraud for a long time.  This includes FMCN’s extremely reluctant 
confirmation that it substantially overstated the size of its LCD network.4  FMCN recently 
disclosed that on March 14, 2012, the SEC informed it that the SEC was investigating the 
Company for possible securities law violations.5  Yet, Carlyle is leading a private equity 
consortium to buy FMCN.  The equity sponsors will borrow a significant amount of money to 
buy the company.   
 
We have been asked repeatedly to comment on the LBO and have not done so until now.  For the 
record, we believe that Carlyle and the other sponsors’ investors will experience a significant loss 
on the FMCN transaction if consummated.  Why would the transaction proceed in light of all of 
the issues?  Carlyle has certainly had its problems in China, including China Agritech Inc. (OTC: 
CAGC) and China Forestry Holdings Inc. (0930.HK).  In any event, some things cannot be 
explained – many asked the same question of HP’s acquisition of Autonomy.   
 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
4 FMCN vehemently denied our allegation at first, and even hired two firms to “verify” the size of its LCD 
network.  FMCN eventually conceded that it was counting in excess of 30,500 cardboard posters in order to 
meet its LCD count – see our Feb. 9, 2012 report on FMCN.
