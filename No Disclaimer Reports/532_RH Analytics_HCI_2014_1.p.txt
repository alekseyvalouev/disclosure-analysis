HCI Group: Q2'14 Results Show Business Model Strains

Summary


We see business model strains emerging below the surface of HCI's reported
results.


Creative reinsurance structures and stock buybacks help camouflage emerging
issues, but underwriting income is declining, driven, in part, by dramatic increases in
compensation.


We question how much longer investors will pay an inflated valuation for a subsidy
dependent business model with negative operating leverage.


Analysis of The HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) Q2'14 financial results shows a troubled
business lies just below the surface of what appeared to be a "business as usual" quarter.
Financial reinsurance structures and share buybacks distort the underlying economics of
the business and increase the appearance of profitability. However, our adjusted
underwriting model shows a clear deterioration of results on a year-over-year basis.


The table below is HCI's underwriting P&L. We have made one key adjustment: We added
back $5.1M of accrued, non-cash, reversible profits associated with reinsurance
structures. This gives a realistic view of cash reinsurance costs and allows comparisons
with Q2'13.

Source: Company filings and estimates for policies and salaries.


Our model includes an estimate of 152,818 policies at the end of the quarter.
(Unfortunately, the company has not disclosed the policy count.)


Sequentially, policy count churn and gross premiums were -3.5% and -2.8%, respectively,
reflecting natural post-assumption erosion. On a year-over-year basis, the 9% greater
policy count coupled with price increases led to 11% growth in gross premiums earned.
However, with higher adjusted reinsurance costs, net premiums grew only 3% between
Q2'13 and Q2'14, despite the higher policy count.


Loss expenses increased 5.5% to $18.4M from $17.4M, but the ratio of 20.2% to gross
premiums is still incomprehensibly low.


Operational expenses increased $6M or 39% on a year-over-year basis. The increased
expenses were reflected in a material decline in pre-tax underwriting income of -$5.4M or
-23% to $17.7M from $23.1M in Q2'13.

Most of the expense increase was due to discretionary management items. Increased
compensation and interest expenses accounted for 70% of operating expense growth.
Compensation expense absorbed 8.6% of gross premiums earned in the quarter, a
number that appears quite high compared to competitors. As a point of comparison,
United Property (NASDAQ:UIHC) spent 4.5% of gross premiums on G&A expenses in the
quarter.


The deterioration in results is quite apparent when viewing the basic underwriting
business model, as we show below.

After adjusting reinsurance costs, the total expense ratio for Q2'14 increased to 80.6%
from the reported 75.1%, compared to 71.8% in Q2'13. Pre-tax margins, the natural
corollary of the total expense ratio, declined to 19.4% from 28.2% in the prior year.


Dwindling underwriting income on a year-over-year basis was largely masked on HCI's
P&L by the reduction in reinsurance premiums due to the accrued profit-sharing; most of
the reduction in EPS that would have occurred in the quarter was likewise masked by a
stock buyback.


During Q2'14, management repurchased 277,510 shares of stock for an average price of
$36.03 per share. The table below compares EPS for Q2'14 and Q2'13 on an as reported
and adjusted basis.

As the table indicates, the reported comparison of $1.39 and $1.40 for Q2'14 and Q2'13,
respectively, would have been less favorable at $1.36 for Q2'14 adjusting for the stock
buyback.


In addition to boosting EPS, the buyback also has the effect of helping to neutralize the
impact of increasing management compensation by reducing dilution of share awards.
Thus far in 2014, HCI management has granted themselves 98,720 shares.


Buybacks may serve management, but repurchasing stock at 2.4x book value does not
serve shareholders well, as illustrated below.


Source: Company filings and estimates.


The table above adjusts book value per share by reducing total assets and equity by the
purchase amount of $17.8M and the share count by the number of shares purchased
year-to-date. The result is that management destroyed roughly $1 per share in book value
with buybacks.


There was one last item in the quarter that struck us as very peculiar. On the conference
call, an analyst asked management to discuss the real estate portfolio. Mr. Patel gave an
indefinite response. Yet, the 10-Q reveals that HCI entered a $9.8M agreement to finance
the development of and option the purchase of a shopping center.


Why wouldn't management discuss what appears to be the single-most important
development in its investment portfolio, particularly when directly queried on the topic?
Perhaps it is because many may consider it unwise for an insurance company with
significant catastrophic exposure to use its small surplus to fund a foray into commercial
real estate lending. Or perhaps it was simply an oversight, like the failure to discuss the
policy count at quarter's end.
