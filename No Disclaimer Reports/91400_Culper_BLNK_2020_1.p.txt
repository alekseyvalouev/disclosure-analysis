Blink Charging Co. (BLNK): You Won’t Miss It 
 


We are short Blink Charging Co. (“BLNK”, “Blink”, “the Company”) as we believe that the Company has vastly 
exaggerated the size of its EV charging network in order to siphon money from the pockets of investors to insiders.  
Blink claims that “EV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging stations,” but we estimate the 
Company’s functional public charging station network consists of just 2,192 stations, a mere 15% of this claim. 
 
In stark contrast to management’s further claims that these chargers are high-tech and in high demand, our 
investigators confirmed what Blink's financials already suggest: almost no one uses Blink’s charging stations, many 
of which are in utterly decrepit condition. Our on-the-ground visits to 242 stations at 88 locations across the U.S. 
revealed a plethora of neglected, abused, non-functional, or otherwise missing chargers. Our analysis of the 
Company’s own data suggests that the average charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per day (0.39% to 2.65% 
utilization), while annual charging revenue of a mere $6.37 per member suggests that the average Blink member 
doesn’t even obtain one single full charge from the Blink network over the course of an entire year. We think that 
even at 20x current utilization, Blink’s network would continue to incinerate cash. In sum, Blink vastly overstates 
the size, functionality, usage, and economic potential of its chargers. 
 
We believe Blink is a scheme designed by Chairman and CEO Michael D. Farkas to pillage minority investors to the 
benefit of insiders. Since 2014, compensation expense of $44 million is more than double the Company’s $18 
million in cumulative revenues, which have remained flat despite the Company’s incessant promotion of 
supposedly groundbreaking partnerships, international expansions, and new technology under development. 
Blink management isn’t bulking out an EV charger network; they’re bulking out their own wallets. 
 
This scheme mirrors Farkas’s previous involvement as majority shareholder in multiple companies that were tied 
to money laundering, drug trafficking, and stock promotion schemes. Skyway Communications purportedly 
developed in-flight technology, but the Mexican government seized 5.6 tons of cocaine on board Skyway’s 
“demonstration” aircraft, and the stock collapsed. Farkas was also majority owner of Holiday RV Superstores and 
involved at GenesisIntermedia, both of which collapsed in connection with a multi-$100 million money laundering 
scheme. Finally, Farkas is tied to Red Sea Management, which was sued by the SEC for “fraudulent pump-and-
dump schemes … and launder[ing] millions of dollars in illegal trading proceeds out of the United States…” 
 
We don’t think Blink will end any differently. The Company was formed as New Image Concepts, Inc., an entity set 
up by Gregg E. Jaclin, a lawyer now barred by the SEC for his “public shell factory” scheme, and Blink’s significant 
ownership has also included an offshore Belize shell company which traces to the Panama Papers. Farkas has now 
dumped at least 1.8 million shares over the past 2 years while at least 7 executives and board members have left 
the Company. This mass exodus has culminated with COO James Christodoulou in March 2020. Christodoulou is 
now suing Farkas and the Company, citing numerous counts of securities fraud. Also in March 2020, the 
Company’s primary lender and 9.9% shareholder – Justin Keener – was charged by the SEC, which cited toxic 
convertible lending practices. Given Keener’s significant Blink ownership and role in the Company’s capital raising, 
we expect fallout. Thus, Blink has turned to the PPP program, taking a loan which it has already burned through 
and does not intend to repay. Regardless of whether Blink finances its scheme with the aid of SEC-barred 
individuals or simply loots government coffers, we see the Company as a cash pit which will continue to siphon 
capital from investors to insiders. We believe Blink shares are ultimately worthless, and we are short.

Blink vastly overstates the size and functionality of its charging network 
 
Blink has rallied over 500% in the past 3 months as management constantly promotes the Company’s supposedly 
massive, high-tech network of over 15,000 chargers: 
 


- The Company’s March 2020 press release states that, “Blink Charging (Nasdaq: BLNK, BLNKW) is a leader 
in electric vehicle (EV) charging equipment and networked EV charging stations, enabling EV drivers to 
easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging [sic].” 
 


- In a July 8, 2020 promotional video, Farkas claims that Blink is “the largest, from a scale size. There are 
some smaller [network operators] who have a smaller amount of locations, but we’re in a lot more areas.” 
 


- In August 2020, Blink states it “has deployed over 23,000 charging stations, many of which are networked 
EV charging stations, enabling EV drivers to easily charge at any of Blink’s charging locations worldwide.” 
 


- Just 2 days ago, the Company’s Twitter account claimed that “Blink's network of over 15,000 chargers 
gives EV drivers the ability to charge their car wherever they live, work, and play.” 


 
This 15,000 figure has been consequently gulped down by investors, hook, line and sinker. 
 


We believe Blink overstates its functional public charger count by nearly 7x, 
and the Company’s true functional public network holds just 2,192 chargers 





 
 
First, the majority of the Blink’s historical “deployments” which the Company claims are part of its “network” of 
15,151 chargers have not been “deployments” but one-time sales to residential owners. See on page 22 of the 
Company’s Q2 2020 form 10-Q, which cleverly misrepresents non-networked residential stations as if counted 
“additionally” to the 15,151, rather than included in that figure:

“As of June 30, 2020, the Company had 15,151 charging stations deployed, of which, 5,385 were Level 2 
commercial charging units, 102 were DC Fast Charging EV chargers and 1,193 were residential charging 
units. Additionally, as of June 30, 2020, the Company had 305 Level 2 commercial charging units on other 
networks and there were also 8,166 non-networked, residential Blink EV charging stations.” 


 
Residential charging station sales come with little to no long-term charging revenue potential for Blink, as the 
units simply feed from residents’ existing electricity sources. We also see these boxes as highly commoditized 
where Blink possesses zero differentiating technology. See the Level 2 charger available on Amazon for $399, 
which rests in a 10th place no man’s land on Amazon’s list of best-selling EV charging stations against both cheaper 
and higher-tech solutions: 
 


 
 
Unless Blink expects that all residential charger owners are set to open their garages for complete strangers to 
steal their electricity, the Company’s claim that “EV drivers can easily charge at any of its 15,000 charging 
[stations]” is an egregious overstatement which we suspect has been designed to mislead investors.   
 
We believe that management also misrepresents the growth of its network, as claims to the number of owned 
chargers the Company has deployed on a quarter by quarter basis are directly contradicted by its Form 10-Q. In 
Q2 2020, Blink claims that it deployed 662 units, all of which remain owned by the Company (rather than being 
sold to individuals, as above): 
 


“Those [662] units were actually deployments between our turnkey and hybrid model units, that is 
exclusive of the any hardware sales that we did. Those are strictly deployments of new [chargers] in the 
Blink owned services.” 


 
However, the Company’s 10-Q’s discloses chargers by type at the end of each quarter. From Q1 to Q2, the 
Company’s in-network count expanded by just 224 chargers, a mere one-third of the Company’s claim. The same 
goes for Q1 2020; Blink claimed to have deployed 582 units in the quarter, but total chargers actually fell by 135:

In spite of the Company’s press release and conference call claims to be deploying hundreds of Company-owned 
chargers each quarter, only 5,487 of the Company’s 15,000+ chargers are commercial chargers on the Company’s 
network. This figure hasn’t meaningfully grown in the past 5+ years, even as the Company has hemorrhaged cash 
while insiders have gotten much richer: 
 





Blink isn’t bulking out a public EV charging network, 
it’s bulking out the pockets of insiders 


 
In light of these figures, we find Farkas’s further claim that Blink is “the largest” operator laughable. ChargePoint, 
which is in fact the largest EV network in the US and Canada, states in its August 2020 fact sheet to possess “more 
than 114,600 total charging spots and more than 2,488 Express DC fast spots.” EIA data also shows that Tesla 
possesses 5,207 locations, SemaCharge possesses 1,579 locations, and Electric Circuit possesses 1,479 locations, 
each of which is greater than Blink’s 1,287 locations, per the EIA.

Blink offers a map that specifies individual addresses and locations of its charging stations, which, given the level 
of detail, we’d consider the most reliable source of information: 
 


 
 
Using the details offered on Blink’s “live” map, we visited 242 chargers at 88 locations across the United States. 
These visits only reinforced our view that Blink’s charging network claims are totally disconnected from reality: 
 


(1) Missing chargers: In 23 cases (9.5% of total), Blink’s map claimed that there were chargers on site, yet we 
were unable to locate the chargers, or locate all of the chargers claimed. When possible, we also inquired 
with site attendants in an effort to locate the chargers. 


 
(2) Non-functional chargers: In 39 cases (16.1% of total) we found chargers that, even though they existed, 


were visibly damaged and/or non-functional. As many of these chargers have been left to the elements 
for close to a decade, the most common deformities were due to sun and heat damage. 
 


(3) Inaccessible chargers: In another 18 cases (7.4% of total), we found that chargers were inaccessible to the 
general public. Many of these were behind locked garages, or restricted only for employee (in office 
buildings) or resident (in condo or apartment buildings) use only. 


 
Consolidated data from our site visits is shown in the table below: 
 





In short, our sampling suggests that of the 3,275 chargers listed on the Company’s map, only 67% of these, or 
2,192, exist, are functional, and are publicly accessible. Our appendix at the end of this report details each visit

in full. See for example, from our visit to The Hilton La Jolla in San Diego, where we found non-functional screens 
and chargers filled with cobwebs, indicating that they had been neglected and unused for quite some time: 





   
 
See from The Irvine Group, also in San Diego, where upon our visit, Blink claimed to hold 3 chargers, 2 of which 
were Ready and 1 of which was Busy. However, we found only 2 stations, 1 of which was badly damaged:
Culper Research Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) August 19, 2020

On the Company’s Q2 2020 conference call, Farkas claimed that the “noticeability” of the Company’s charging 
stations could lead to new revenue streams, namely in advertising: 


 
“So there are a lot of ways for us to monetize our locations. There are also opportunities that we haven't 
really dealt with in the past that we're now going to incorporate into our business model, which is we 
have a lot of real estate on our charging stations. There are many, many opportunities to be able to make 
money off of it even more so that we're making other charging stations utilizing advertising capabilities 
on these charging stations. They're very noticeable ...” 


 
We see these comments as nothing more than a pipe dream. Many stations we visited were buried away in parking 
garages; these are hardly “noticeable” as claimed by Farkas. Even so, given the decrepit state of many of these 
stations, we fail to envision how they could be used to advertise anything other than a junkyard to scrap them in. 
 
In a visit to Kennesaw, Georgia, outside of Atlanta, Blink claimed to have a charger available for use. However, all 
we found was a single charging cord which had been piped outside of an industrial door. We tried the door but 
were unable to locate the actual charging unit. It’s unclear to us how anyone would be able to use the charging 
cord here even if they wanted to: 
 


…1 of which was badly damaged Blink claimed 3 chargers; we only found 2…

See from our visit to St. Thomas University just outside of Miami, Florida. While Blink claims that this charger is 
“Ready” for use, we found that the extreme wear on the machine and its non-functioning screen would make this 
extremely difficult:
Culper Research Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) August 19, 2020 


10 
 


We also note that we found chargers which were accessible and appeared to be functional, but were unusable 
nonetheless. For example, at 401 N Michigan Ave in Chicago, we spoke with the parking attendant who stated 
that the Blink chargers are rarely used, as the chargers shut down after 5 minutes, leaving users without a charge. 
Regardless, the only chargers we counted as non-functional were those with visible damage (i.e., not those below): 
 


 
 
We believe Blink has made little effort to repair these chargers because it simply doesn’t have the capital or the 
service teams to do so. To repair its network would be both a costly endeavor and an admission that much of the 
Company’s network is dilapidated. Instead, Blink has chosen to distance itself from responsibility, even authoring 
a blog post which answers the customer question of “Why Do I Find Nonworking Chargers That Seem to Never 
Get Fixed?”. Blink states, “It’s natural to blame the company that makes the equipment for not maintaining their 
own product, but it’s not always the choice of the EVSE manufacturer for equipment to remain broken.” 
 
We’re not alone in experiencing these issues; customer complaints span numerous third-party sites and the 
Company’s app reviews. See for example from the Company’s Facebook page, Tesla Motors Club (both here and 
here), and Yelp. We also compare Blink’s mobile app ratings to other industry apps. The (1) incredibly small 
number of reviews relative to peers, and (2) low overall score suggests that very few EV owners actually use Blink’s 
network / mobile app, but when they do, they are most often left disappointed: 
 


App iOS Rating    Review Count 
EV Connect 4.5 stars        210 reviews 
PlugShare 4.8 stars        44,260 reviews 
EVgo 4.4 stars        1,039 reviews 
ChargePoint 4.6 stars        4,177 reviews 
Blink Mobile 2.3 stars        143 reviews 


 
These reviews frequently complain of both (1) non-functional and (2) non-existent or inaccessible chargers, which 
we profile in the appendix at the end of this report. Given Blink’s app garners an overall score of just 2.3 stars and 
the majority of ratings are just 1 star, we encourage readers to read the reviews in full.

Blink’s own financials indicate that its network is hardly ever used 
 
Blink consistently fosters the fairytale narrative that its charging network is not only massive, but in high demand. 
For example, in a February 14, 2020 promotional interview, Farkas stated that “We’re growing in coordination 
with the growth in EVs.” However, on the Company’s Q2 2020 conference call just last week, when questioned on 
charger utilization, Farkas stated that, “At this time we’re not disclosing utilization. It’s sensitive business 
information we need to keep that close to heart at this point.” We think this is a lame deflection to avoid the 
admission that charger utilization is anemic. Over the last twelve months, the Company has generated charging 
revenues of just $1.15 million. At $0.05 in fees per minute and 75% consolidated revenue share (the Company 
claims fees of $0.04 to $0.06 per minute), we find the average Blink charger is utilized for just 6 to 38 minutes per 
day, or just 2.65% utilization, at most. Ironically, the Company’s claims to possess a massive network only further 
demonstrate just how rarely that network is utilized by customers: 
 


 
 
Rather than simply disclosing utilization, Blink has promoted a growing member count as an indicator of usage. 
For example, in a May 2018 press release, Farkas stated that “Anyone can use Blink Chargers without being a 
member, so this milestone is a significant indicator of how many EV drivers are active, committed, and engaged 
with the Blink Network.” In a June 2018 promotional video, Farkas claimed that “The members are what feeds our 
business. That really corresponds to how many EV drivers are using our services.” We view this focus on member 
count as another clumsy distraction from the Company’s inability to generate meaningful revenue growth. Blink 
reported 88,000 members in “early 2017,” 125,000 members in May 2018, “over 125,000 members” in June 2018, 
165,000 members in February 2020, and 180,000 members in April 2020. As such, we triangulate the Company’s 
average member count in each year to find that annual charging revenue per customer has fallen by over 55%:

As EV batteries typically possess 40 kWh (ex: Nissan Leaf) to 100kWh (ex: Tesla Model S), at Blink’s charging fees 
of $0.39 to $0.79 per kWh, a full charge costs between $15.60 and $79.00. Thus, Blink’s sub-$10 revenue per 
member, per year, suggests that – even if non-members were to be responsible for zero revenues – the average 
member does not even complete a single full charge on Blink’s network over the course of an entire year. 
 
Blink touts multiple revenue models, yet we believe none of them are economically tenable for the Company. 
That said, Blink clearly wishes to portray itself as an owner and operator of a massive, high-tech EV network rather 
than a vendor of low-margin, commodity hardware products: 
 


- In a February 6, 2020 promotional interview, Farkas claims, “We make money by selling electricity … Our 
main business is to own and operate charging stations.”  
 


- In another February 14, 2020 promotional video, Farkas claims that, “We sell electricity. And the spread 
of what the electricity costs us, and what we sell it for is how we make money.” 


 
Given that a mere 27% of LTM revenues were charging service revenues, we  see these comments as a blatant 
misrepresentation of Blink’s business. Nevertheless, we maintain that the brutal unit economics of Blink-owned 
chargers preclude them from ever reaching profitability: 
 





We assume $0.05 in charging revenue per minute, the midpoint of Blink’s disclosed fees of $0.04 to $0.06 per 
minute. At 70% gross margins, each station could generate $668 in charging profits per year at 100% utilization. 
Informed by conversations with former Company employees and research from the Department of Energy, we 
estimate it costs Blink about $2,000 to produce each Level 2 charger, while average installation costs are another 
$2,000. Blink’s stated useful life for machines is 5 to 7 years, but we generously assume a 10-year useful life, 
especially given the condition of many Blink chargers we’ve witnessed. Even then, for Blink to break even on 
owned-charger deployments, chargers need to maintain at least 60% utilization. In light of our derived current 
utilization of no more than 2.65%, such a notion is utterly fanciful. 
 


Blink’s business isn’t designed to ever generate cash, 
only to continually stuff the pockets of insiders

Blink mirrors Farkas’s involvement in multiple previous criminal schemes 
 
Blink Chairman and CEO Michael D. Farkas began his career as a broker in the 1990’s New York City boiler room 
era, where his BrokerCheck indicates that he worked at 8 different firms in a 4-year period, earning himself a 
regulatory disclosure due to alleged “transactions in the accounts of public customers without their knowledge or 
consent.” Farkas then took to the investor side, where Blink’s most recent April 2020 investor presentation 
characterizes him as  having built “a track record as a successful principal investor across a variety of industries, 
including automotive, retail, telecommunications, agriculture, and aerospace.” However, this description 
conspicuously lacks references to specific companies, and for good reason: 
 


- Skyway Communications (formerly SWYC) purported to be “developing a ground to air in-flight aircraft 
communication network that we anticipate will facilitate homeland security and in-flight entertainment.” 
However, this was effectively a front. In 2006, an aircraft was seized by the Mexican government holding 
5.6 tons of cocaine, reportedly $100 million worth. With Farkas as the company’s largest investor, at one 
point holding majority ownership, the stock collapsed, and Skyway’s principals were sued by the SEC for 
the pump-and-dump scheme. Farkas denied knowledge of the scheme, even as Skyway had just 2 
employees and shared an office with Farkas’s investment firm, which was a majority owner. 


 
- At GenesisIntermedia, Inc. / Genesis Realty Group, (formerly GENI), Farkas worked with Jeffrey and Darren 


Glick, Adnan Khashoggi, and Ramy El-Batrawi. The group was sued by the SEC, alleging, in sum, “a scheme 
to manipulate the stock price of GENI, now-defunct public company, and misappropriated more than $130 
million in the process.” This was part of a broader scheme, which also involved Atlas Recreational / Holiday 
RV Superstores, where Farkas was a majority owner with 59% of the company. As part of this scheme, the 
SEC also brought charges against MJK Clearing, Inc., a.k.a. “Stockwalk”, which lost more than $200 million 
and was forced into liquidation.  
 


- With respect to Red Sea Management Limited, Farkas and his Atlas group of companies were sued for 
fraud relating to co-involvement in Skyway. Red Sea was also involved with several additional public 
issuers including SLS International, Inc. GeneThera, Inc., and Freedom Golf Corporation. To that end, the 
SEC also sued Red Sea, alleging that it conducted “fraudulent pump-and-dump schemes on behalf of its 
clients and laundered millions of dollars in illegal trading proceeds out of the United States to its clients 
overseas.” Red Sea was also tied to online gambling, money laundering, short-term payday loans, and 
bootlegged/pirated TV shows. 


 
Interested readers can also look further into Farkas’s Atlas Group of companies, i-Incubator, and Balance Labs for 
a broader history of Farkas’s corporate miscreance. In short, this history is highly concerning, especially as, in our 
view, Blink mirrors the same blueprint as many of these prior schemes. Blink was originally formed as New Image 
Concepts, Inc, a shell company created with the aid of Gregg E. Jaclin, the same lawyer behind many of Barry 
Honig’s schemes. Jaclin was sued by the SEC in May 2016 for his role in creating a public shell factory, and in May 
2017, he was criminally indicted and barred from the SEC in August 2019. 
 
Blink’s offering documents through June 2017 also list a Belize entity by the name of “Allston Limited” as an 8.88% 
owner of the Company:

Allston’s purported address at the Blake Building is tied to the Panama Papers, and Belize has been well known 
for housing stock manipulation / money laundering rings, uncovered and sued by both the SEC and DOJ. We 
remain highly concerned that this offshore entity is connected to Blink, especially given Farkas’s prior involvement 
in offshore money laundering and stock manipulation schemes.  
 
Farkas came to Blink in 2010, prior to the Company’s first purchases of its car charging assets. Blink’s core network 
assets were acquired from ECOtality, which was originally backed by $126 million of Department of Energy (DoE) 
investments. For ECOtality’s part, it was meant to build out a network of at least 14,000 chargers in 5 states. 
However, ECOtality’s technological prowess was lacking. As securities lawsuits later alleged:  
 


“The Minit-Charger 12 did not work and could not be fixed … exhibited unacceptable performance 
shortfalls during prototype verification testing … overheating of connector plugs … hundreds of 
overheating reports … caused by a defective cables…”  


 
Faced with the prospect of recalling thousands of its connector plugs and performing costly repairs, Ecotality 
declared bankruptcy in September 2013. Just a month later in October 2013, Blink, then “Car Charging Group,” 
purchased these assets for a mere $3.3 million. Thus, at year-end 2014, Blink held $6 million in assets against $17 
million in total liabilities. From 2014 through 2019, Blink spent a cumulative total of just $1.45 million in capital 
expenditures, which does not suggest that the Company brought these assets to fully functioning order. 
Nevertheless, in August 2017, the Company announced a corporate rebranding and 1 for 50 reverse split, and in 
February 2018, closed an $18.5 million offering and NASDAQ listing, underwritten by Joseph Gunnar & Co., LLC.  
 
Blink’s scheme is running out of steam 
 
Questions of the reported size, functionality, and usage of Blink’s network aside, the Company consistently churns 
out press releases touting “partnerships” and “expansions” that we find to be spineless. Most recently, the 
Company claimed to have signed an agreement with Cushman & Wakefield “for the marketing and potential 
deployment of Blink charging stations…” However, C&W made no commitment to charger installations at existing 
properties, nor did C&W commit to install a certain number of chargers in the future. Blink also did not file a Form 
8-K regarding the supposed agreement. As such, we believe that either (1) the agreement is immaterial or non-
existent entirely, or (2) Blink has failed in its disclosure duties. Farkas also claimed on the Q2 2020 call that the 
Company had wireless charging technology “under development.” We are highly skeptical of this claim, given that 
Blink has $0 disclosed R&D spend, and of the Company’s 48 employees listed on LinkedIn, we find zero with the 
requisite engineering experience presumably required to develop such a technology. Instead, we see these claims 
as merely the latest in Blink’s long line of promotional claims which have failed to come to fruition:

- In July 2018, the Company claimed to have finalized a “global expansion deal” which would “better serve 


EV drivers in South Korea and Southeast Asia.” However, today, the Company has disclosed zero stations 
in South Korea or Southeast Asia. 
 


- In April 2016, the Company claimed “to facilitate the launch of a vanpool and car sharing program.” If 
Blink currently has any involvement in car sharing programs, we are not aware of it. 
 


- In September 2015, the Company claimed “to offer energy storage and rechargeable battery solutions.” 
Similarly, so far as we can tell, the Company does not currently offer any sort of energy storage or 
rechargeable battery solution. 
 


- In October 2014, the Company claimed “to expand operations into China.” Similarly, if Blink currently has 
any stations in China, they are not disclosed by the Company. 


 
While Blink has yet to grow revenues in any meaningful manner, that hasn’t stopped insiders from continuing to 
collect healthy paychecks. On the Q2 2020 conference call, CFO Michael Rama stated that, “We are 
unquestionably investing in people in preparation for and in part to create the dramatic growth we anticipate.” 
This is a line investors shouldn’t fall for any longer; since 2014, the Company has burned over $44 million in cash, 
while total compensation has also summed to $44 million; indeed, the Company’s constant capital raises are in 
effect going directly into the pockets of insiders: 
 


 
 
Even amid this egregious compensation, Farkas unloaded over 1.8 million shares over the past two years alone:

… And numerous insiders have left the Company since 2018: 
 


Blink Insider, Role Tenure at Blink 


James Christodoulou, Chief Operating Officer August 2018 to March 2020 


Jonathan New, Chief Financial Officer June 2018 to February 2020 


Robert C. Schweitzer, Board Member July 2017 to August 2019 


Grant E. Fitz, Board Member August 2018 to August 2019  


Ira Feintuch, Chief Operating Officer March 2015 to October 2018 


Andrew Shapiro, Board Member April 2014 to June 2018 


Andy Kinard, Board Member, President November 2009 to March 2018 


 
These departures culminated with ex-COO James Christodoulou in March 2020. The Company fired Christodoulou, 
alleging workplace misconduct. However, Christodoulou sued the Company just days later, in short, alleging that 
he was fired for voicing concerns over the Company’s numerous securities law violations and Farkas’s abusive 
workplace behavior. According to the complaint, not only was unjust insider enrichment the norm at Blink, but 
employees were often “Farkasized,” or subject to Farkas’s tirades without warning. We place several relevant 
portions of the complaint in the appendix below. 
 
We view Blink’s recently  incessant promotion streak as borne of increasing desperation. The Company’s February 
2018 public offering raised $18.5 million, but this covered just less than two years of cash burn, and its war chest 
is depleted. Blink’s capital raising has also relied on Justin Keener, aka JMJ Financial, since at least October 2016, 
at which time the Company executed a note for up to $3.725 million. These notes contain ratchet features which 
allowed JMJ to convert its loan to equity, and over time, Blink’s reliance on JMJ has made Keener a 9.9% owner:
Culper Research Blink Charging Co (NASDAQ:BLNK) August 19, 2020

However, in March 2020, Keener was charged by the SEC for failing to register as a securities dealer. The SEC 
complaint alleges that Keener engaged “in a regular business of buying convertible notes and selling the resulting 
newly issued shares of microcap stock into the public market, Keener operated as an unregistered securities dealer 
and generated more than $21.5 million in profits.” Given this is the same scope of business Keener conducted at 
Blink, we expect significant fallout. 
 
Thus, Blink has apparently turned to the government, as in May 2020, the Company received $856,000 in loan 
proceeds under the PPP program. In the Company’s Q2 2020 report, Blink disclosed that it has already blown 
through the entire proceeds of the PPP loan, while it expects the loan to nonetheless be forgiven. We consider 
Blink’s PPP loan a gross abuse of the program, and encourage the Board of Directors to return the funds. But 
regardless of whether Blink finances its scheme with the aid of SEC-barred individuals or simply loots government 
coffers, we see the Company as a cash pit which will continue to siphon capital from investors to insiders.

of the chargers at the Mall of America are broken, and I'm running out of words, but the short if [sic] it is 
blink sucks.” 
 
Android, October 12, 2019: “Unreal how difficult your chargers are to use. I've used Charge Point, EV 
connect, & Sema Connect. I'm on Droid and downloaded your app and tried to setup credit card 3 times. 
The card scanner didn't work. The screen doesn't move down far enough during address entry. I wasn't 
able to enter the code. I wasn't able to "start charge" it just sat waiting forever to connect. Guest, signup, 
sign in... alas ended up just giving up.”

blink stations in my area have broken screens…” 
 
iOS, July 10, 2018: “Tried to use it and found many of their stations have awful screens are [sic] broken. 
Too expensive. Finally tried the pay station and it charged me 1.24 for no power.”
