LDK Case Should Be Flag of


Caution for China Sky One


Investors.


Yesterday shares of LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK) were


down more than 18% after the company released second


quarter earnings, which reported a second signi�cant


inventory write-down. The shares are down 82% since


asensio.com issued its �rst report on LDK.


asensio.com previously issued 17 reports on LDK beginning


in October 2007 concerning accounting irregularities. The


irregularities centered on the company’s inventory �gures


and reported earnings.


To read the asensio.com reports on LDK’s inventory issues


and previous write-down, click here.


In Febuary 2008, LDK stated that a purportedly independent


committee found no material errors in LDK’s inventory


accounting. The committee retained the law �rm Simpson


Thacher & Bartlett to handle an investigation on the


inventory issue. asensio.com questioned the validity of the


�ndings.


A research analyst from Soleil Securities Group published a


report following the earnings release stating that LDK would


be “bankrupt anywhere but China.”
