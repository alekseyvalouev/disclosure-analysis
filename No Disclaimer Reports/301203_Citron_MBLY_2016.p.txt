Mobileye is Worth $11 per Share:  
 


Insiders Know it, Goldman Sachs Knows it, Citron 
Knows it, and Now You Know it.   








 
2016 Price Target (Generous) Reduced to $11 


 
Mobileye has become The Most Outrageously Overpriced, Overhyped 


Semiconductor Stock Ever. Citron values it the ONLY way it can be valued. 
 
Last year Citron introduced readers to Mobileye.  Riding the thesis that Mobileye 
(NASDAQ:MBLY) was the premier play on “autonomous driving", analysts have 
justified a valuation multiple for Mobileye that surpassed even Qualcomm's 
multiples in 2009.”  (Citron detailed the comparison here.)  
 


Since our first report, the Mobileye’s long-term prospects have gone from bad to 
worse.  Insiders know it, Goldman Sachs definitely knows it ... because at the end 
of the day… Money Talks and Bullshit Walks.  
 


In this report, Citron Research offers up the only intellectually honest way to 
value Mobileye.  Our conclusion is a stock price of less than $11 per share.  And 
our methodology is more than fair.  We use as our comp NVIDIA, a powerful and 
credible technology company that IS the future of autonomous driving.  
 


What's changed since the last Citron Report on Mobileye?

1. The Company has tacitly admitted that their corporate strategy for 
penetrating autonomous driving has been inadequate all along (Wall Street 
has completely ignored this major blunder.) 


2. Clear evidence has emerged that the ADAS competitive landscape is rapidly 
succumbing to commoditization.  


3. Insider selling has reached a level that has gone from abusive to obscene 
4. The analyst community has lowered forecasts, and the company admits no 


visibility in its business model after 2019. 
 


Mobileye is meeting with institutional investors this week.  The company is doing 
their best imitation of a college kid at a bar at 2:00 AM:  They say whatever they 
have to do to get into bed, regardless of the truth.    
 


For anyone who is taking management at their word in recent 
meetings on the Street, just remember that in April 2012, at a time 
when the company had a $751 million valuation, they guided to $726 
million in 2016 revenues.   
 


Today its valuation is 1,175% higher, yet their revenues for 2016 are 
estimated be slightly above $350 million, less than half their revenue 
model at that time. For further insight into the insanity of the current stock 
price, Mobileye used those lofty projections to sell 25% of the company for $400 
million in mid 2013.  And today it’s worth 8.8 billion?  With its bus token R&D 
spend?  
 


Needless to say, their market position has become increasingly 
precarious, as we explain below. 
 


1. Mobileye’s Corporate Strategy Has Been Inadequate 
Since IPO  





From its IPO prospectus, investors were led to believe that Mobileye was a pure 
play on autonomous driving.  Their ADAS technology, a rapidly growing but 
modest-sized specialty technology sold to Tier 1 auto suppliers, was claimed to be 
the clear and obvious stepping-stone to a massive technology revolution.  
Mobileye management justified their low R&D spend by stating that their 
superior image analysis capabilities allowed them to completely forgo expensive

mapping technology, as well as the complex problem of fusion of multiple sensor 
types.  And they exclusively owned this space; everyone else had it wrong.    
 


Here's Mobileye's largest outside shareholder gassing off on the topic, nearly a 
year after IPO: 
 


 
http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shmuel-harlap-im-not-selling-mobileye-1001003307 


 
In fact Evercore defended this very strategy as recently as December 2015:  
 





Less than 6 weeks after Evercore's magnum opus, which was filled with direct 
rebuttal commentary on Citron's last report on Mobileye, the company 
presented at CES.  Their big "PR moment" was a complete about-face on the 
strategy.   
 
It announced to the world: 
 


"But what are Google and Uber really spending on?  We believe primarily 
detailed mapping – a technology that leverages existing strengths – while 
relying on incumbent OEMs and suppliers for interpretation of visual and 
laser sensor data." 
 


"These behemoths are not spending in the area in which Mobileye has a 
dominant technology." 
 


-- Evercore "analysis" of Google and Uber's delusional spending on mapping technology,  
while Mobileye's approach to "ADAS and autonomous"  


(as though it's one and the same thing) elevates it above everyone else  
-- December 1, 2015 


"The question is whether Mobileye or Google's technology conquers the 
auto industry, the auto manufacturers, and their customers. As far as I 
know, Google's current solution is very complex and expensive, and can't be 
commercially applied. Google approaches this field from a very different 
angle from Mobileye's. Its technology is based on mapping everything 
around the vehicle, and this mapping takes a lot of time and energy. 


Mobileye doesn't have this problem. It doesn't have to map 
anything." 


-- Shmuel Harlap, MBLY Largest Individual Investor 1/22/2015

http://www.marketwatch.com/story/mobileye-scoffs-NVIDIA-says-maps-key-to-autonomous-driving-2016-01-06 





Here's the company's own PR.  Unfortunately, Mobileye neglects to mention that 
in mapping they are directly competing with Nokia, BMW, Daimler, VW, 
Microsoft, Amazon, Toyota and Nissan, Uber and of course Google (here, here 
and here.) Oh, and let's not forget  Baidu ,the ‘Google of China’, and at least 5 
other Chinese auto makers.  And Tier 1 suppliers Bosch, Continental and Denso … 
each of which is making massive concurrent R&D commitments.  But besides that 
why should investors be concerned about Mobileye being 5 years late and $20 
billion short to the mapping party? 
 


2.  Commoditization Arrives in the ADAS Space  
 


The highest multiple semiconductor stock of all time should not be facing the 
imminent pricing headwinds that we see in the ADAS feature space. Look what we 
have read in the past three weeks alone. 
 


Last week NVIDIA held an investor day.  The transcript is eye popping with regard 
to the future of ADAS technology. 
 





This is a terrifying commentary if you are a Mobileye investor.  Your main 
investment premise is that Mobileye's market share in the current ADAS market is 
its free pass to controlling the immense market for autonomous driving 
technology.  But years before it can roll out even a Gen 1 product to address that 


“And if the cockpit computer has access to the cameras and sensors, why 
not just bring in the ADAS for free. Do object detection, do 
classification, do surround view, do a surround mirror application, do a 
visualization system that replaces the side mirrors on the car. Put in a 
system where you can have surround view and you can detect if children 
run behind the car, or if a dog is running around the front. All of these things 
now become upgradable software instead of boxes that cost $200 each.”

market opportunity, its bread-and-butter is already on a competitor's radar to 
become little more than a "free app" running on an onboard computer.   
 
Just last week we read from Honda, a Mobileye customer: 
 





Yet another clue as to the emergence of low-cost 
ADAS components:  
 


A .92c crash avoidance sensor from Nippon Ceramic!   
 


http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-10/a-92-cent-chip-for-
driverless-cars-is-a-windfall-for-japan-maker 


 
 
The commoditization of sensors and chips is not a surprise to any seasoned 
semiconductor analyst.  This is Moore's Law at work, and we've seen this same 
trend transforming everything from personal computing to cell phones to 
cameras.   
 


3.  Insider Selling:  And this includes Goldman Sachs   
 


While Mobileye management intentionally misappropriated the glamour of 
"autonomous driving" to pitch its highly aggressive IPO pricing, they don't 
misunderstand the value of their stock internally.  This whole story can be 
summed up in the old adage: 
 





Our first report (page 11) detailed how Mobileye IPO's and secondary raised just 
$200 million for the company, while cashing out insiders to the tune of $1.6 


“Honda’s Chris Martin says the company is able to offer this advanced level 
of ADAS as a $1,000 option (it’s standard equipment on the Civic Touring 
sedan) because they’ve been rolling it out across the company’s lineup for 
the past two model years. “Once you commit in higher volume,” Martin 
says, “the cost comes down.” You’ll also find Honda Sensing in the CR-V, 
Pilot and Accord.” (March 18, 2016)

billion in its IPO in 2014 and a follow-on offering in May 2015.  Why would they 
create such a massive insider payday if they intended to compete seriously in 
autonomous driving, and if they were actually planning to succeed?  
 


Since then it has gotten worse....much worse.  Let’s start with the largest 
shareholder:  Shmuel "I'm Not Selling Mobileye" Harlap. 





http://www.globes.co.il/en/article-shmuel-harlap-im-not-selling-mobileye-1001003307 
 


According to his Jan 2016 13G, only a year after this interview, he's now sold 
nearly 20% of his stake, taking a nice $140 million off the table since that article 
was published. And that's just the beginning.   
 


In handwritten Form 144’s filed with the SEC, which these guys know full well 
won't be posted on the SEC website, because they are foreign filers, the Chairman 
and CEO of MBLY both filed to sell combined over $120 million worth of stock 
from just the last Citron report until now.  That is almost 3x what the company 
will spend in R&D in 2016…and that is just the past few months.

No commentary is necessary:  $2 billion in insider sales speaks for itself. 
 


4.  Goldman Sachs Knows!!  And Morgan is Saying it too 
 


While it might be too early to pick the winners and the losers in the autonomous 
driving space, we can guarantee one thing- Goldman Sachs is banking every one 
of them.  With that certainty, we just follow the money. 
 


At IPO Goldman Sachs owned 30.4 million shares of Mobileye, appx 15% of the 
outstanding shares.  In less than 2 years they have sold 96% of their stock, and as 
of their last filed 13G, own just 1.2 million shares. 
 


The REAL Analysts Know the Imminent Headwinds of Mobileye. 
 


Mobileye analysts are split into two camps.  You have the consumer products 
analysts like Tavis McCort of Raymond James and Brad Erickson at Pacific Crest.  
Don’t look for any deep insight from these geniuses… Mr. Erickson was talking it 
up at $69 while Mr. McCourt had a $71 price target on GoPro, and stayed bullish 
all the way down.  Accountability among sell-side analysts is a scarce commodity. 
 


When looking at the actual auto industry analysts, we note the Citi analyst who, 
while not publishing his own business model, based his entire recent 
recommendation on meetings with management, and on that alone, put forth a 
2025 DCF -- as though this guy knows what 2025 is going to look like…LOL 
 
The key analyst whose commentary should be read by all investors is auto analyst 
Adam Jonas at Morgan Stanley. While he is obligated to be bullish (because that is 
what analysts do) his words are harrowing.  The January report from Morgan is 
filled with important risk identification points, which reveal the underlying truth: 
 


 
 
Here Mobileye's most ardent cheerleaders are questioning its margin dominance 
in the ADAS game: 


“MBLY's existing and new competitors could eventually figure it out and offer 
the same vision proposition that MBLY does. If Continental and Bosch figure 
out a way to make stereo systems just as reliable and cost effective as mono 
systems, they will be a legitimate threat to MBLY's dominance.” 


-- Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley Analyst  1/14/2016

Finally, Morgan Stanley acknowledges the power of deep learning AI computing 
may tilt the ADAS marketplace in favor of companies like NVDA: 
 


 
 
In this clip, which he edited 18 months after he published it, we see Jonas 
assessing the rate of change to identify the oncoming threat to the business: 
 





Just eighteen months later, he now states: 
 





" “Access to this opportunity with deep defensive moats around the 
business in the near-term are expected to drive revenue growth” 


--Morgan Stanley March 10, 2016. 


" “Access to this opportunity with deep defensive moats around the 
business are expected to drive revenue growth” 


--Morgan Stanley Sept 3, 2014. 


“Longer term, several companies would like to use their strength in 
computing, graphics, baseband, or vision systems to build a single 
comprehensive vision system or ADAS chip, to take all inputs and help 


manage the car, but we think that will take 4-5 years to materialize.”  
-- Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley Analyst  1/14/2016 


“There can be no guarantee that this leadership position will last forever. 
The biggest technological risk facing a vision based ADAS/autonomous 
system is the likelihood that a primarily radar or LIDAR based system (with 
vision as a redundant backup) can get up to the same or better level of 
accuracy at a lower cost. If this happens, vision systems could be de-
prioritized and MBLY could also be affected. Another potential threat comes 
from widespread rollout of V2V/V2X communication. If all cars on the road 
can talk to each other and to the road infrastructure, there may not be a 
need for a 99% accurate vision system for autonomous cars especially with 
radar and LIDAR redundancies.”  


-- Adam Jonas, Morgan Stanley Analyst  1/14/2016
Mobileye Revisited  April 13, 2016 Page 9 of 13 
 


Where Jonas fails is when he assigns his price target. 
 


Morgan Stanley acknowledges that there is no visibility past the next few years 
but half of the value they ascribe to Mobileye comes from a terminal value in 
2030 and they have a DCF from 2025.  This kind of analysis is intellectually 
bankrupt, and doomed to take its investors down with it.   
 


Citron Now Presents THE ONLY WAY to assign a 
Valuation to Mobileye – Our $11 price target is based 
on Fair, Reasonable, and Generous Terms  
 


Amidst a Corporate strategy of misdirection, massive insider selling, and the 
absence of any meaningful R&D now or planned for the next 5 years, we're left 
with a big challenge: How do you value this company?   
 


Morgan Stanley’s model and the whole Mobileye story falls apart after the year 
2019.  Citron has put into a chart Mobileye's projected R&D spend.  
 





This plan reflects a company that is complacent with their legacy business until 
2019.  Has the company decided there is no reason to change its plan and spend 
any real money on research until at least 2021?  This graphic illustrates what 
happens to Mobileye in 4-5 years.
Mobileye Revisited  April 13, 2016 Page 10 of 13 
 





Even Mobileye's most prestigious customer Tesla just made it perfectly clear that 
they are committing serious money to hire in-house talent toward developing 


autonomous driving within Telsa effective immediately.  Look at the heavy 
hitters they hired: 
 


http://www.thecountrycaller.com/45067-tesla-motors-inc-tsla-developing-next-gen-autopilot-with-team-of-chipmakers/ 
 


Is it entirely reasonable to wonder if Tesla will even be a Mobileye customer come 
2020? 
 


We note on a recent Mobileye conference call management stated: 
 


 
http://seekingalpha.com/article/3925806-mobileyes-mbly-ceo-ziv-aviram-q4-2015-results-earnings-call-


transcript?part=single 





We don't provide specific information about 2019 and all the details of that. 
We just set a goal and what we believe based on all that we know. And bear 
in mind, we know it for fact, because of all the programs that we won, 
because of all the relationship that we have with OEMs, and we feel 
comfortable with placing these figures for 2019.

You Must Compare Mobileye to NVIDIA…(no offense, NVIDIA) 
 
NVIDIA is core to autonomous driving.  Take it from Elon Musk: 
 





https://blogs.NVIDIA.com/blog/2015/03/17/tesla-elon-musk-NVIDIA/ 





NVDA has a real technology partnership with Tesla, a dedication to deep learning 
AI technology, and a product that could marginalize Mobileye’s importance.  
NVDA is who MBLY wants to be. 
 





http://fortune.com/2015/03/18/tesla-elon-musk-and-NVIDIA-ceoself-driving-cars/ 


 
NVIDIA also has contracts with almost all auto manufacturers and tier one 
suppliers.  Yet, while NVDA has a guaranteed business post 2019 in multiple 
industries beyond automotive, MBLY is not even guaranteed a seat at ANY table 
post 2020.   
 


To get to this point NVDA has spent $6 billion in R&D over the past 5 years - R&D 
is central to innovation in computational-heavy technology and NVDA knows it, 
but perhaps not MBLY.  
  


“What NVIDIA is doing with Tegra is really interesting and really important 
for self-driving in the future...” 


-- Elon Musk March 17, 2015

Mobileye Revisited  April 13, 2016 Page 12 of 13 
 


MBLY vs NVDA | R&D     


Year MBLY NVDA Difference 


    2011 $15.4  $1,003  ($987) 


2012 $15.9  $1,147  ($1,131) 


2013 $22.3  $1,336  ($1,314) 


2014 $36.9  $1,360  ($1,323) 


2015 $43.4  $1,331  ($1,288) 


    Total R&D $134  $6,177  ($6,043) 





And R&D is remains as important as ever, especially as the space becomes more 
competitive. 
 


Let’s make this valuation analysis simple and honest  
 


Citron will concede to Mobileye its projected 2019 revenues. We will than take its 
gross margins and put in line with NVIDIA and give it the same multiple as 
NVIDIA's Tegra Chip.  Doing that here is the math: 
 


Citron Target Price   
  


2019 MBLY Revenue $1,100 
NVIDIA Tegra EBITDA Margin(1) 19% 
2019 MBLY Assumed EBITDA $209 
Using NVIDIA's 2019 EBITDA Multiple  13.0x 
Implied Enterprise Value (as at 2019) $2,716 
  


Discount Rate 8% 
Discount Factor 1.3605 
Discounted EV (as at current) $1,997 
  


Less: Cash ($473) 
Implied Mkt Cap. $2,470 
FD Shares 239.6 
Implied Share Price $10.31 
Drop in Price (74%)
Mobileye Revisited  April 13, 2016 Page 13 of 13 
 





(1) NVIDIA Gross Margins on Tegra chips were said to be 53% as outlined by NVIDIA during its last 
investor day; Citron has given MBLY the benefit of the doubt by giving it NVDA’s EBITDA margin (which is 
based off a higher 56% gross margin for all of NVDA) 
 


Citron has done the same analysis on Price/EPS and EV/Sales. The bottom line is 
the same whichever method you choose; the bottom line valuations were all 
within $1 of the approach presented above. 
 


From the "can't stop shaking our head" department, we throw in a comparison of 
insider selling over the past two years: 
 


NVIDIA $61 million 


Mobileye $ Over 2 Billion with a "B" 
 


Conclusion 
 


The best way to conclude this story would be from the insightful words of Google 
which Citron calls the Mobileye Dilemma.

Mobileye Can Jump ... But it Will Never Fly.  Management knows it, Goldman 
Sachs knows it, Citron knows it – And now you know it. 
 


      Cautious Investing To All       


“Conventional wisdom would say that we’ll just take these driver 
assistance systems and we’ll kind of push them and incrementally 
improve them and over time they’ll turn into self-driving cars. Well 
I’m here to tell you that’s like me saying that if I work really hard at 
jumping one day I’ll be able to fly. We actually need to do 
something a little different.” 


-- The Mobileye Dilemma was best articulated by Google’s director of self-
driving cars Chris Urmson
