(1) Actual Gamesys Group Ave Profit Margins (PM) between 2008 and 
2014 were 23%


(2) We have reduced Gamesys Group PMs for the POC taxes.  Point of 
Consumption (POC) taxes are a newly implemented tax in the United 
Kingdom which became effective in December 2014 (15% of gaming 
revenue).  They are approximately 12% as not all of Gamesys’ 
revenue is derived from the UK (we have assumed 80% of the 15% 
POC tax)


(3) We have reduced Gamesys Group PMs for the new Licensing & 
Platform Fees.  Licensing & Platform Fees are an expense which 
Intertain agreed to pay Gamesys as part of the acquisition and 
related agreements.  They are approximately 13-15% of revenues (or 
~C$50-C$60 million).  


(4) The net result of (3%) profit margin is what would be expected 
under Intertain for Jackpotjoy (JPJ), Botemania and Starspins


(5) Intertain has however achieved PMs of 38% for the Gamesys assets 
purchased thus far (based on average of Q2 and Q3 2015) – the fact 
that (4) and (5) do not tie is highly suspect; the fact that there is a 
41% discrepancy is just mind boggling


• Our diligence suggests that the assets not purchased from 
Gamesys were profitable so this would not assist in bridging 
the gap


• The question arises…how are these margins possible with 
~26% in friction costs between the POC tax 
implementation and new licensing fees?


• An argument can be made that some of the licensing & 
platform fees replace G&A, but this delta does not solve the 
mystery


Margins generated by Intertain for the Gamesys Assets 


appears to be impossible; A Tail of Two Cities!

 Separately, the acquired Gamesys assets and Intertain have other issues which include:


 Intertain and its shareholders celebrated a Q3 2015 financial results which provided by a top line beat, 
however, few realized that adjusted net income was down year-over-year across three out of four of Intertain’s 
acquired entities


 Jackpotjoy (Intertain’s primary and flagship asset) player counts continue to appear to be in decline


Put another way, margins achieved by Intertain do not appear possible for the combined entity 


based off a flagship Gamesys asset that almost never exceeded 25% profit margins

Industry Data Suggest the Bingo Market in the UK is in Decline: Management promotes that bingo is a growth market and operations in 
regulated markets protect its cash flow. Yet, based on our extensive due diligence we find that Bingo trends in the UK (its core market) 
have been in decline in the last few years, JPJ trending data suggest it may not be a market leader (as they claim), and at worst could be 
losing share. Furthermore, regulated markets such as the UK have introduced new consumption taxes, with other countries likely to 
follow.  In our view, regulation is a serious headwind which contrasts management’s marketing spin, that it is beneficial.

Management Backgrounds Appear Checkered, Littered With Questionable Business Connections, History of Value Destruction: John 
Kennedy FitzGerald (CEO) has ties to penny stock promoters and people who have run afoul of the law. Keith Laslop (CFO) also has ties to 
questionable individuals and was involved in the collapse of NYSE listed Gerova Financial (an SEC investigated company), an alleged Ponzi-
like scheme. Darren Rennick (President, Bahamas) is featured in a book (Fatal System Error) that describes cyber crime, links to 
sophisticated gangs and stolen financial data.  An undisclosed and contentious Management Incentive Plan (MIP) has already enriched the 
CEO/CFO with C$17m this year, not to mention its bankers (led by Canaccord) have earned upwards of C$127m in fees. We are concerned 
that Intertain could exist primarily as a vehicle that enriches insiders and advisors, while leaving shareholders left holding a collection of 
mature gaming assets, saddled with C$758m of debt and financial obligations, which could rise substantially from an increasing earn-out 
payment schedule.  This is not the first time shareholders have been left holding the bag when FitzGerald, Laslop or others are involved.


Intertain is Another Speculative Canadian Roll-Up, But in Our Opinion the Worst of its Kind: Formed from Canadian shell companies, 
Intertain has completed four acquisitions, each of which has gotten larger and fed Intertain’s ‘growth at any cost’ mentality which is likely 
to end in disappointment. Intertain’s initial transaction was with Amaya Inc (a 2.7% owner), whom is currently being investigated (by 
FINRA) for insider trading (the largest investigation ever in Canadian history). Intertain acquired Amaya’s InterCasino brands for C$70m. 
Amaya acquired these assets through its acquisition of Cryptologic (where Intertain’s CEO was General Counsel).  Our diligence suggests 
Cryptologic paid a ‘nominal amount’ for Malta’s InterCasino gaming license. Our research closely explores Intertain’s acquisitions and 
finds significant issues for a majority of the deals, notably the Gamesys acquisition (the largest acquisition to date – see below).


Management’s Recent Acquisition of Gamesys Assets, is Heavily Promoted and Appears Fraught With Issues: The transaction to 
acquire Gamesys brands (primarily Jackpotjoy (“JPJ”)) requires a massive up-front fee (C$812m), ongoing licensing & platform fees (C$50-
C$60m annually) and an earn-out which could be almost as big as the up-front fee (C$249-C$632m or up to 75% of up-front fee – per 
agreements reviewed by us). Intertain appears to have significantly overpaid; paying a control premium but receiving no control of the 
underlying assets – this agreement in our view resembles more of an operating lease than an outright purchase.  Intertain has purchased 
a mature asset that appears to be in decline whilst leaving all growth assets and key Gamesys technology with the founders. 
Management handily steers investors away from significant new costs like the 15% UK POC tax and licensing & gaming fees (which are 
~13-15% of revenues).  Despite these headwinds, Intertain has somehow nearly doubled Gamesys’ historic margins. Shortly after the 
completion of the acquisition, the driving force behind Gamesys’ operations officially stepped away from his operating role, but 
awkwardly his replacement still heads up the Gamesys growth assets not acquired by Intertain.

Debt Load and Weight of the Acquisition Earn-outs Could Crush Intertain: Intertain’s debt-funded acquisition spree and earn-
outs have pressured its balance sheet, which has little tangible asset value and C$1.4bn of goodwill and intangibles (>85% of EV). 
By our estimate, Adj. Debt to EBITDA is approximately 5.8x; however, with the Gamesys earn-out alone having the potential to 
reach up to C$632m, Intertain will have to show investors that its assets have the cash flow sustainability to delever and fund 
obligations, particularly as key service agreement costs are set to increase by 25% in the future. 


Q3 2015 Financial Results and Cash Management Appears Suspect: Intertain boasted revenue growth during its Q3 2015 call, but 
failed to mention that adjusted net income was down across most business units.  Shareholders were quick to identify the massive
acquisition related fees in Q2 2015 forcing management to hold an investor call over its excessive incentive plans, but everyone
seems to have missed the material licensing & platform fees being paid to Gamesys founders, not to mention the new POC taxes.
Revenue growth boasted by Gamesys seems to be questionable, especially as marketing expenses appear to be low with industry 
pressures at an all time high. Contrary to popular belief, Intertain appears to have cash flow issues through the first few quarters 
right after purchasing the Gamesys assets. Intertain stated that its operating cash flows are being set aside for the company’s 
massive earn-outs, but this doesn’t appear to be the case. Nearly all cash generated this year is being used to serve interest costs, 
mandatory debt repayment, and a buyback put in place in response to shareholder outrage from the excessive management 
compensation and governance breakdown.  Intertain delayed paying its interest expense from Q2 2015 until Q3.


Numerous Accounting, Financial Reporting and Disclosure Concerns: After flipping through three auditors like pancakes, Intertain 
still can’t seem to get its accounting, financial reporting and disclosures straight. Our biggest concern is that Intertain appears to 
have implemented a stealth change of revenue recognition policies from ‘net’ to ‘gross’, which artificially juices its reported 
revenue, while its margins have mysteriously expanded beyond our comprehension.  We’ve identified multiple errors in its 
financials, along with financial legerdemain to boost its Adjusted EPS by not tax-adjusting add-backs (properly adjusted EPS in our 
view with tax effects would be down 50% from levels reported).  The company boasts its businesses are doing well, but provides no 
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) which are customary financial reporting metrics used in the gaming industry.  Not surprisingly, 
Intertain’s governance committee did not meet in 2014 (not even once).


Valuation Disconnect: By adjusting Intertain’s enterprise value for enormous earn-outs and properly tax-adjusting its Net Income, 
we find that it trades at a rich EBITDA and EPS multiple compared with industry peers. Management claims that its stock is 
undervalued and it may be subject to a predatory buyer...nonsense! The implementation of the POC tax and new costs related to 
licensing & platform fees take a significant chunk out of its valuation. Given our grave concerns about management’s history,
various accounting and financial reporting inconsistencies, and the mountain of debt placed on its largely intangible asset base, we 
see 45-70% downside in its share price.  Intertain is highly likely to roll snake eyes.

2014 Annual Report (2nd Page) 


Prominently Features the CEO


John Kennedy FitzGerald


Do Not Confuse Intertain’s CEO with 


John Fitzgerald Kennedy, the 


Respectable U.S. President


A central tenant of good investment analysis requires a detailed assessment of the CEO, his background, and history of value 
creation (or destruction). Academics have rigorously studied the topic of CEO narcissism (source, source 2) and how damaging 
it can be to a company’s success. It is worth considering that the second page of Intertain’s 2014 Annual Report prominently 
features its CEO John Kennedy FitzGerald (not to be confused with John Fitzgerald Kennedy) In the following slides, we detail
the background of Intertain’s CEO and supporting cast and believe investors should be cautioned

 FitzGerald has connections to penny stock promoters and individuals who have run afoul of the law


 Ironically, FitzGerald is a lawyer by background and training, but does not appear to be a lawyer in good standing. According to our search at 
the Law Society of Upper Canada website (see next slide), his license has been “surrendered” –he is no longer permitted to practice law


 FitzGerald was previously involved in raising financing for WG Limited (another gaming company)


• He “introduced them to three of the defendants who had expressed an interest in investing in the Platform – William Fielding, Barry 
Alter and Phil Gurian” (source), the case claims that FitzGerald mislead WG Limited (where FitzGerald and various others were sued 
for duping shareholders)


• “FitzGerald would receive a fee of 2% of the equity taken from the plaintiffs’ shares” – FitzGerald appears to use a similar strategy for 
Intertain where he collects a 2% fee for arranging M&A deals 


• It is notable that John Fielding, an Intertain director was also named as a defendant in this lawsuit – an initial sign of a cast of 
characters that keeps resurfacing together


 In February 2012, FitzGerald and Alter were plaintiffs in a lawsuit against Dwayne Bigelow 


 A review some of FitzGerald’s network noted above:


• Barry Alter:  previously involved with penny stocks like HIET (HiEnergy Technologies) which destroyed shareholder value (source)


• Phil Gurian:  (aka “Florida Phil”):  previously sentenced to jail for running an illegal gambling ring and “sometimes manipulating betting 
lines established in Las Vegas”; the judgement against him was for $150 million; (source, source 2)


• Dwayne Bigelow: April 22, 2015 Dwayne Bigelow Charged In $9 Million “Pump And Dump” Stock Fraud Scheme tied to Emerging 
World Pharma, Inc. (“EWPI”), SMC Entertainment, Inc. (“SMCE”), and Sierra Resources Group, Inc. (“SIRG”) (source)


 During the Q3 2015 Intertain earnings call, FitzGerald states “This is our first public company” - this statement does not appear to be accurate 


• FitzGerald was previously General Counsel at CryptoLogic which was publicly listed in Canada, the US and UK


• Laslop (CFO) was previously a COO of Gerova Financial, another publicly listed company which will be discussed shortly


 John FitzGerald’s wife works at Cassels Brock (source), which is Intertain’s laws firm


• Although she does not do Intertain’s legal work, she has done legal work for Canaccord (Intertain’s banker) involving assets of Amaya 
(Intertain shareholder) and Crytologic (the CEO’s previous company) (source)


John FitzGerald has a questionable background who is unlikely to


drive shareholder value creation at Intertain

 Laslop was previously and intimately involved in what appears to be an elaborate Ponzi-like scheme where shareholders lost significant 
sums of money at Gerova Financial (source, source 2, source 3, source 4)


• Laslop was director of Rineon Group(1) and former Gerova COO (it is noted that this has been omitted in Intertain’s current bio for 
him) – he was sued for fraud by way of a ponzi scheme whereby Laslop and associates assigned Gerova’s real estate to an 
uncontrolled entity thereby creating shareholder losses at the benefit of related parties (which should have been disclosed)


• Gerova, like Intertain, was created out of a shell company
• At this entity, Laslop was associated with various questionable individuals who had been sanctioned, sued or shut-down by 


regulators including Jason Galanis (once known as the “New King of Porn”), Matthew Jennings (barred by FINRA) and Westmoore 
Capital (alleged Ponzi-like fraudulent scheme raising $53m)


• On Sep 24, 2015, the SEC announced charges against most of Laslop counterparts including Jason Galanis for the Gerova 
Scheme with maximum penalties of 20 years in prison:


• Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said: “As alleged, Jason Galanis and his co-conspirators used their Wall Street 
credentials and the veneer of a legitimate-sounding financial firm to manipulate the market and fleece investors. Their 
alleged market manipulation brought them nearly $20 million in profits, but now also a federal indictment.”


• Are the SEC and FBI done with there charges on this matter?  How come Laslop was not charged as a board member and COO? Is 
there any chance he was not tried because he cooperated with investigations?


 Mr. Laslop’s bio indicates he was CFO, then President, of Prolexic Technologies (2004-2008) a Distributed Denial of Service migration 
provider


• In Nov 2006, New York authorities issued a 33-count indictment, where Prolexic was named, regarding an illegal online gambling 
operation – at the time, Laslop was Prolexic’s President (source)


• In Mar 2007, Prolexic, once again related to an illegal gambling ring, were charged as a result of association with corruption and 
money laundering 


• After approximately four years at the company, it was acquired for $11M (source) – likely a poor result for its shareholders


Laslop’s current biography omits his role as COO and Director at Gerova, an NYSE listed that 


collapsed which had ties to Westmoore Capital, an alleged $53m Ponzi-like Scheme.1


(1) Gerova purchased the Rineon Group; Laslop was director of Rineon Group at the time; Gerova purchased Rineon Group without disclosing Laslop’s position. Intertain discloses Laslop’s position with 
Gerova in the Aumento Capital II Prospectus on 2/4/14, but recent biographical references (eg. Corporate Investor Presentation, Autumn 2015) omit his Gerova position.

 Darren Rennick is currently President of Intertain Bahamas and former CEO of Prolexic Technologies 
alongside CFO Laslop


• Rennick appears to be integral to Intertain’s success as he is the one person elected to the 
Governance committee for the Gamesys assets – in this role, he monitors and works with 
Intertain’s largest investment and asset


• Oddly, Rennick appears to be located in the Bahamas and with Gamesys in the UK –it would 
appear that he is not optimally suited to be in this governance role, even before a review of his 
dubious background


 Rennick is famous! His escapades are documented in the book “Fatal System Error,” which is 
described as a true-life tale of how US mobsters and Russian gangsters have exploited the Internet 
and the Web over the past decade to rake in the money (source)


• Page 68 of Fatal System Error: “For the company’s chief financial officer, he picked an old 
friend, Keith Laslop, whose brother had been Darren’s roommate at a Canadian college.  In

Rennick was noted in the book “Fatal System Error”. 


His association with CFO Keith Laslop was also mentioned in the book.


Available on Amazon and Google Books
 Rennick was also Director and Executive VP of Fund.com starting Sep 2007


• Fund.com lost 99% of its value by Apr 2011 (source) and had links to Jason Galanis, the same Galanis that was involved with the 
Gerova Ponzi-like scheme. Laslop was also a director at Fund.com


• “This is the Jason Galanis behind Fund.com” (source), his theatrical background includes:
• He is son of John Peter Galanis, the California con artist who defrauded Eddie Murphy and Sammy Davis Jr and inevitably drew 


prison time for a  $400M ponzi scheme
• Jason was once arrested, but not charged or prosecuted in a drug-dealing case
• He was barred by SEC from serving as officer/director of a public company for 5 years for “knowingly and recklessly preparing 


false financial statements for Penthouse International” (source)
 Rennick was director, president and co-founder of IQ-Ludorum plc (source)


• It appears he left IQ for another company which was later sued by IQ for stealing code for running casino games (page 42)

A Governance Committee that governs least, governs best?


The Intertain Governance Committee had no meetings during fiscal year 2014


Source: Intertain Notice of Annual and Special Meeting of Shareholders and Management Information Circular (page 30), May 20, 2015
23


 On August 12, 2015 Intertain reported its Q2 2015 financial results


• Within its financial statements, a gaping hole burned brightly with acquisition related costs for the quarter coming in at C$29.1m 
and C$53.4m for the first half of the year


• This represented over 6% of the cost of the Gamesys assets acquisition


 Shareholder’s reacted fiercely to the C$48.8m quarterly loss by sending shares from approx. C$16 to the C$11 range by month’s end 


 On Sep 1, 2015: Intertain had a conference call to explain the recent swirling rumors of an excessive management incentive plan (we 
dissect some of the issues in the Appendix)


 The previously undisclosed management incentive plan allowed the CEO and CFO to collect fat bonuses tied to acquisitions:


• The MIP bonus pool is equal to 2% of the value of each transaction successfully completed by the Company


• That amount is modified by the increase or decrease in market price for the common shares from the date the transaction is 
publicly announced to the date the transaction closes


• Management receives 25% in cash and the balance, at the discretion of the Board, in phantom equity units, to ensure that future 
shareholder returns are aligned with future realized value of the compensation, or cash


 FitzGerald appears to have taken a page out of his old playbook at WG Limited where he created an arrangement whereby 
shareholders paid him 2% for funds raised, receiving in excess of C$13m for himself


 The accompanying press release states that:


“The MIP was established to serve the interests of both Intertain and investors, generating substantial reinvestments in the Company, 
rewarding management for growth and acquisition performance, and contributing to a substantial increase in shareholder value.”


 Earning a fee tied to a short-term stock price reaction is an aggressive, non-standard, and myopic way to judge management on the 
success or failure of long-term valuation creation 


 Management, has tried to claim that CEO FitzGerald and CFO Laslop have invested more in Intertain than they have received in after-tax 
compensation. We have attempted, but failed, to reconcile this statement in the Appendix, and conclude it appears to be inaccurate  


Governance issues are rampant at Intertain. It appears management put its self-interest in 


compensating itself ahead of its shareholders in a grotesque manner.

Intertain was formed as an amalgamation of Goldstar and Aumento Capital Corp. Goldstar would acquire 


CryptoLogic’s old Malta assets (InterCasino brands) with the support of a C$65m capital raise


 According to an SEC Form D filing, Goldstar Acquisitionco Inc. (“Goldstar”) was formed in 2013 and approximately US$ 1 million 
of capital was raised.  Laslop and FitzGerald where named as related officers and directors of Goldstar


• A prospectus filed at SEDAR on Feb 4, 2014 for Aumento Capital Capital II Corp (to be renamed Intertain Group Ltd.) 
would later reveal that Laslop, FitzGerald, and Rennick owned 68% of Goldstar


 On Oct 21, 2013 Aumento Capital II Corp. announces proposed transaction with Goldstar and a Subsidiary of Amaya Gaming 
Group Inc. (“Amaya”)


• All of the issued and outstanding securities of Goldstar will be exchanged for securities of Aumento (the Amalgamation)
• Immediately preceding the Amalgamation, Goldstar completed the purchase from a subsidiary of Amaya all of the 


outstanding shares of online casino operator WagerLogic Malta Holdings Ltd. ("WagerLogic") for cash consideration of 
C$70 million


• The Share Purchase includes an earn-out agreement pursuant to which the vendor thereunder may receive additional 
cash consideration payable on the second and third anniversary date from Closing based on the achievement of certain 
revenue targets, as well as a minimum revenue guarantee agreement pursuant to which the vendor, in the first two 
years following the Closing, may pay Goldstar cash consideration if certain revenue targets, approximately in line with 
recent audited revenues, are not achieved.


• Following closing, subsidiaries of Amaya would continue to supply WagerLogic with software, services and content to 
power its online casino operations, pursuant to a services agreement.


 Aumento Capital II had limited capital, so funds were later raised. On Dec 19, 2013 Aumento announced the closing of a private 
placement by Goldstar which sold 11.625m Unit Subscription Receipts at $4.00 per unit and 17,500 Debentures at $1,000  to 
raise C$64.5m. With the capital raised, along with a C$10.0m take back promissory note, the shares of online casino operator 
WagerLogic Malta Holdings Ltd were acquired

Bingo Is a Growth Story We Have Stable Cash Flow to Lever Up!


 Intertain presents global bingo as large and 
growing, but the reality its that over 70% of 
current revenues come from the UK, a 
mature/declining market


 Expansion into other markets is fraught with 
risk, not to mention other incumbent 
competitors, legal, regulatory, and other factors


 Management has shown it is capable of paying 
for growth via acquisitions, but not enough time 
has passed to evaluate its ability to grow and 
expand organically – initial signs are not good


 Intertain presents this slide with the implication 
being that its overall business is stable, and thus 
capable of support debt to expand


 The reality is that Intertain does not provide regular 
KPI (key performance metrics) to allow investors to 
assess underlying business performance.


 Cash flow may not be as robust as suggested: 
Cumulative operating cash flow since inception (of 
Intertain) is just C$12m

With U.K. bingo clearly in decline and Foxy Bingo, a competitor, also feeling the effects, 


how has Intertain’s key U.K. asset Jackpotjoy posted growth in Q3 2015?


 Bingo industry in UK is in decline dropping 4% and 2% over the prior two years (respectively)


 The market has illustrated excitement about an Intertain acquisition of the FoxyBingo asset from GVC
 Problem is the assets are in decline and performance has deteriorated; just another sign that the industry is in decline
 However, Intertain may need to acquire this asset to continue its roll-up strategy and hide the potential cracks that are beginning 


to surface in Intertain’s acquired assets

Central to Intertain’s investor pitch is that its stable business in regulated markets should support its ability to 


handle leverage. Conversely, we find it has had irregular cash flow and produced just C$12.1m of cumulative free 


cash flow. Management needs to demonstrate it can manage its operations before embarking on further acquisitions

Regulation is Part of the Pitch We’re The Biggest and Best


 Intertain’s suggestion to investors is that they 
should gain comfort that regulation is somehow 
beneficial to them


 In reality, it is our opinion that regulation limits 
upside to investors. Increasing regulation (such as 
the new UK POC tax) and discussions in other 
countries about increasing taxes, means more of 
management’s time could be directed to 
compliance matters, and increasing costs that 
pressure the bottom line for shareholders


 Regulation does not always prevent fraud or other 
side unsavory side effects from the gaming 
business: witness the issues faced by Jackpotjoy 
customers stealing to fund addictions


 Intertain presents itself as having the #1 market 
position in the UK, its largest market by revenues


 However, the footnote on the slide sources is “Based 
on Gambling Compliance 2013 market size 
estimates” – a study that is now outdated by 2yrs!


 Our own independent research suggests that 
Intertain’s dominance in the UK may be questionable:


 Tombola itself calls it Bingo’s largest Bingo site
 Bingocount.com has JPJ at 8th
 An industry leading intelligence report, 


Stickeyes Report, on the UK gambling market 
does not place JPJ in the top 10

A counter to the story spun by management  Increased regulation really means less cash flows 


due to compliance and taxes


Intertain Suggestion Reality


Operating in regulated
markets puts them at a benefit 
compared to their competitors


• Additional regulation means the government will look to take their piece of the pie (like the 
December 2014 roll out of the POC taxes in the UK)


Regulated markets will hurt 
smaller players more than 
Intertain


• Government regulation requires companies to adhere to laws and regulations
• These laws and regulations can change at any time
• Compliance and disclosure takes time, effort and costs money
• Still we found research that suggests there are still new entrants into the bingo market


(source) – a direct contradiction to Intertain’s suggestions that smaller players are in trouble


Operating in regulated
markets allows for greater 
liquidity for players


• Liquidity is hampered as moving money across borders comes with significant tax 
implications


• As such, growth in new markets will require an investment in liquidity and thus working 
capital


 Various countries are considering implementing equivalent to the UK POC tax:
 Italy is considering a 25% withholding tax to companies transacting over €5M and operating longer than 6 months (source)


 As of Sep 1, 2014, JPJ was suspended in Italy – this suspension should impact revenues going forward
 Spain has considered a tax of 25% of gross profits (source)


 JPJ re-entered Spain in Q2 2015, revenues appear to be immaterial as Intertain stopped disclosing segmented info in Q3 
2015


 Any business from Spain would be negatively impacted by this proposed tax
 Sweden is also considering implementing a tax but could be years away


 JPJ also operates in Sweden and revenues from here (although not disclosed) would take a direct hit as a result of taxes 
ultimately implemented

Bingo Data Trends Per Bingo Tracking Sites and Google Trends JPJ Tracker


 Jackpotjoy somehow claims that it is the largest bingo site in the UK, however all other external bingo sources suggest the opposite – JPJ does not show 
up in the top five


• Bingocount.com has JPJ at 8th (source)
• An industry leading intelligence report, Stickeyes Report, on the UK gambling market does not place JPJ in the top 10 (source)
• Data by BingoPort and bingotrends from 2012 also suggests Tombola to be the largest (source)
• Jackpotjoy is not even in the top 10 per Loquax (source)


 Tombola suggests it is the largest in the UK, which seems justified (source)
 UK Regulators have been contacted to get to the bottom of this
 We have analysed proprietary data attained from BingoCount on JPJ player numbers and room concentrations


• The data is normally quite accurate over quarters
• This time around, our Q3 data suggested revenue should have been flat – it was not and we believe something is amiss


 Loquax data suggests that Jackpotjoy player counts have deteriorated since the beginning of 2013
• At the beginning of 2013, Jackpotjoy used to lead the pack however JPJ and Tombola have since switched spots with Tombola now at the top
• This data has been extracted with data at points in time from Loquax over three years


Note: other Intertain Bingo games have performed well in during this time frame however the focus is on Jackpotjoy, its most important bingo brand and game

Country Our Observations on the Challenges


Mexico • Mexico’s online gaming market is estimated to be ~$300M (source, source 2)
• Mexico has been late to adopt credit card payment for online gambling
• Mexican gov’t hasn’t provided clear guidance on how it will regulate (source)
• Various other entities have tried to establish in Mexico with limited results (Greenplay aka Bingo Crush, Playtech and Caliente partnership)


Spain • Despite being launched through Intertain’s Botemania brand in June, the results have been slow
• Despite a heavy Q2-2015 investment of over $1M, minor July revenues were achieved at a little over $1M. Intertain boasts a 48% market 


share for Spain, this implies that the total Spain market has less than $2M per month
• Laslop (CFO) confirms that Spain is not really growing in the Q2-2015 call “Even Spain isn't growing the entire market”, the latest data from 


Spain confirms this (source). Though Gamesys was one of the first entrants into the Spanish Gaming market, there are now over 25 others 
and competition is now sizzling reducing any chances of Intertain’s success


• FitzGerald (CEO) Q3-2015 call “So it's a great stat. I think it's cause for celebration, but in terms of revenue, the market is still quite small.”


Sweden • Is a small portion of Intertain revenues
• Growth will have to be significant to drive any meaningful traction
• Only 7k monthly active users as at Sep 2014


We view Intertain’s new 


market expansion 


opportunities as unlikely to 


drive near-term 


performance, and fraught 


with business risks given 


that management has not 


demonstrated its ability to 


execute anything other than 


an acquisition strategy in 


mature markets

Roll-up strategies typically have some tangible value, in the case of Intertain there appears to be none.  


Not only that, despite a little over C$1bn in paid acquisitions (prior to earn-outs and fees), the entity has 


approximately C$1.4bn in intangible assets. Excessive intangibles assets are often a warning sign of 


overpaying for acquisitions. Keep reading the next few slides.

 YTD acquisition related fees are C$56 million of which approx. C$17 million 
are related to compensation to FitzGerald and Laslop; this leaves C$36 
million which would represent over 4% of total transaction value


 Typical M&A fees are for transactions of this size are 1-1.5% which begs 
the question, why are these so high?


 Roll ups are good for investment bankers who collect fees


Note: fees above do not include trading fees which could be significant

Intertain and Amaya’s relations run deep and it is not pretty


 Intertain has followed in Amaya’s footsteps


• Like Amaya, Intertain is a roll-up strategy that has tried to pick up a transformational asset – more on how this is not a 
transformational asset later


 Intertain has always aspired to be like Amaya Gaming and most recently on its Q3 2015 conference call, management hints at it: 
“This is a significant advantage of the gaming industry, online gaming industry. When we compare ourselves to other public 
companies in Canada with a similar to double our market cap, we generate more unlevered cash flow than 85% to 90% of this peer 
group.” – there is only one public company that is in online gaming in Canada that has a larger market cap, that is Amaya Gaming


 Amaya and Intertain are also connected through John Fielding


 Recent unconcluded trading probes into Amaya – the FINRA list for potentially inappropriate trading includes three hundred 
individuals of whom 4 are linked to Intertain: John Fielding, Robert Chalmers, Yoel Altman, James Walker and David Baazov (source)


• Dec 12, 2014: Amaya’s headquarters raided by RCMP and securities regulators for potential irregular share trading


• Canaccord (both Amaya and Intertain’s investment banker) was also raided


• Feb 10, 2015: Amaya questioned over 300 investors who pocketed huge gains by acquiring large volumes of Amaya stock 
ahead of the Pokerstars transaction


• Mar 6, 2015: Yoel Altman and Robert Chalmers  mentioned cautiously by a prominent Canadian newspaper, The Globe & 
Mail


• Mr Altman, like Fielding’s holding company, was also on the list of 300 investors that profited handsomely from the 
Pokerstars transaction


• Robert Chalmers, a Toronto stock promoter who was hired by Intertain Group


• Prior to his work with Intertain, Chalmers worked at Canaccord


• Robert also is apparently on the list of 300 investors who have made the FINRA list with regards to the 
Pokerstars acquisition by Amaya


 Amaya is Intertain’s second largest institutional shareholder at 2.7%

 According to CEO FitzGerald’s bio, he assumed the role of General Counsel for CryptoLogic Inc. He was responsible for corporate 
governance and compliance at CryptoLogic Inc, which was listed on the TSX, NASDAQ and the main board of the London Stock Exchange


 CryptoLogic, a developer and supplier of Internet gaming software, provided software licensing, e-cash management and customer 
support services for its online gambling software to an international client base, including many top online gaming brand. Along with its 
business-to-business solutions, CryptoLogic operated an online casino under various brands, including InterCasino, which launched in 
1996 as one of the world’s first online casinos


 A closer look at CryptoLogic shows it was approached by Amaya for a deal on Feb 2, 2012 and later acquired by Amaya on July 30, 
2012 for $2.54sh (a valuation of approximately US$35.8m) and a 56% and 105% premium to the prevailing TSX and LSE stock prices, 
respectively. CryptoLogic had $16.7m of cash at March 31, 2012 ( $1.21 per fully diluted share) which suggests that very little value was 
ascribed to the operating assets and earnings potential of the Company. Furthermore, we estimate CryptoLogic produced $35.1m of 
revenue and $1.95m of net losses for fiscal year 2012, implying a paltry revenue multiple of just 0.5x


 The enactment in the United States of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act in late 2006, which effectively banned online 
gambling in the United States by making it illegal to process the related financial transactions, had a very significant negative impact on 
CryptoLogic’s revenues 


 The Company reported substantial ongoing challenges in 2010 as it continued its strategy aimed at returning to profitability and long-term 
growth against the backdrop of a global economic downturn, continuing disappointing returns from major Hosted Casino licensees and 
licensee delays in the roll-out of Branded Games. By Q1 2010, the Company had incurred eight continuous quarters of significant 
operating losses and negative cash flows.  Against this backdrop of a continuing decline in revenues and working capital, management 
determined that a material reduction in expenses was necessary in order to preserve cash and give the Company time to focus on 
increasing revenues  


 Accordingly, the Company made a significant restructuring effort, commencing midway through Q3 2010, resulting in a reduction of 
almost 50% in operating and general and administrative expense to $6.2 million in Q4 2010 from $12.1 million in Q2 2010. Ultimately, the 
company ran out of options, and when Amaya came to the table with a significant takeover premium, the company was sold


We can track the WagerLogic assets Intertain acquired from Amaya all the way to Cryptologic, a 


public company connected to Intertain’s CEO FitzGerald

CryptoLogic Financials Results Pre-Acquisition CryptoLogic Share Price Pre-Acquisition


 CryptoLogic was clearly struggling before its white knight savior Amaya came along to acquire its shares a 56% and 105% 
premium to the prevailing TSX and LSE stock prices, respectively


 However, before receiving the offer in Feb 2012, CryptoLogic made the following announcement on Jan 4, 2012:


“CryptoLogic Limited, a developer of branded online betting games and Internet casino software, has acquired, for nominal 
consideration, the Maltese online gaming licenses for InterCasino from OIGE, a long-standing customer of the Company’s fully 
hosted online casino platform.  The transfer of the licenses has been cleared by the Maltese Lotteries & Gaming Authority.”


 This deal allowed CryptoLogic to become an online casino operator. As the next slide will illustrate, Amaya would later 
turnaround and sell something it acquired “for nominal consideration” to Intertain’s predecessor company for C$70m

MONTREAL, Canada – February 11, 2014 – Amaya Gaming Group 
Inc. (“Amaya” or the “Corporation”) (TSX: AYA), an entertainment

November 27, 2013 (the “Share Purchase Agreement”), one of its 
subsidiaries has completed the previously announced sale to 
Goldstar Acquisitionco Inc. (“Goldstar”) of all of the issued and 
outstanding shares of WagerLogic Malta Holdings Ltd. 
(“WagerLogic”) for $70 million (the “Purchase Price”), less a closing 
working capital adjustment of $7.5 million, satisfied through cash 
consideration of $52.5 million and a vendor take-back in the form of 
a promissory note of $10 million, bearing interest at 6.0% per 
annum payable semi-annually in arrears starting in the second year 
following the closing date and due on the fourth anniversary of the

Cryptologic Operating Subsidiary Financials


Show Less Revenue and Profit


Source: Malta filing, 9/1/15


Source: SEDAR filings


Business 
performance in rapid 


decline in 2013!


It is difficult to explain why revenues increased by 
$1.2m in the Carve-Out financials for the same 


assets. While possible that separating the 
InterCasino assets resulted in some cost savings, 
which could account for the $1m of bottom line 


increase, the revenue disparity is very concerning.

Recognition Policy
Old CryptoLogic Revenue 


Recognition Policy From Malta Filings


Determination of Revenue


Casino revenue is measured at the fair value of the 
consideration received or receivable for services provided to 
customers in the normal course of business. 


Casino revenue comprises the net house win represented by 
the amount of bets placed by players less any amounts won by 
players, less accrued promotional bonus credits granted by the 
house in order to incentivize players, less revenue in respect of 
Affiliate arrangements, where the Business Unit acts as an 
agent and the third party owns the relationship with the 
customer, plus fraud recoveries, plus or minus jackpot game 
net contributions.


Revenue from the online poker business reflects commissions 
earned from poker games completed by the period end.


Revenue recognition


The Business Unit earns its revenue primarily from operating 
casino and poker gambling sites on the internet.


Revenues from operating casino and poker gambling sites on 
the internet are recognized on a daily basis, at the time of the 
gambling transactions.


Revenue is measured by reference to the fair value of 
consideration received or receivable by the company for 
goods supplied and services provided, excluding VAT and 
trade discounts


Revenue is recognized when the amount of revenue can 
be measured reliably, collection is probable, the costs 
incurred or to be incurred can be measured, and when the 
criteria for the company's activities have been met


Pay Close Attention!


Under the old revenue recognition, CryptoLogic would 
only recognize revenues when it could measure and match 


its costs. This is consistent with the “Matching Principle”


Under the Carve-Out financials used by Intertain on a 
going forward basis, revenues are recognized on a “daily 
basis, at the time of the gambling transaction.” This is a 


much weaker revenue recognition policy that could allow 
Intertain to accelerate revenue recognition, while 


potentially delaying expense.

 Most of the revenue and net income comes from the revenue guarantee provided by Amaya. When the guarantee ceases 
in February 2016, the true underlying cash flow generating capability of the InterCasino business will be revealed


 InterCasino’s performance at the hands of FitzGerald and Laslop does not appear to have improved:


C$ in mm


 InterCasino has also significantly underperformed its target. Intertain initially listed US$30m as a revenue earn-out target 
for 2016. Intertain made the following disclosure in its Q2’15 financials (note 12, Contingent Consideration)


“During the six months ended June 30, 2015, the Company re-assessed the contingent consideration related to the 
InterCasino purchase where the Company is required to pay a bonus payment to Amaya Gaming Group Inc. if 
InterCasino had net revenue greater than $30 million USD by February 2016. The Company no longer anticipates making 
this bonus payment and derecognized the $0.5 million contingent consideration”


 On the Q3 2015 Earnings Call, Laslop offers a glimmer of hope for InterCasino (though time will tell its true fate)


“And for the first time, InterCasino was breakeven event without the Amaya revenue guarantee. InterCasino is moving in 
the right direction.”


InterCasino may have no value to Intertain soon

 June 4, 2014: Intertain announced that it has entered into a share purchase agreement to acquire the entire issued share 
capital of Mandalay Media Limited ("Mandalay") for an initial payment of £45.0 million in cash, subject to working capital 
adjustments, with up to a further £15.0 million in cash contingent on future profit performance


 Earn-out: 7x net profit of the Bingo Business, 4x CasinoChoice, and 3x casino.co.uk for 18 month period ended 10/31/15


 Intertain paid a 1% finder’s fee on the initial payment and earn-out to an unnamed individual


 Mandalay owns some the United Kingdom online bingo websites, including: 


• CostaBingo, Sing Bingo, City Bingo, Fancy Bingo and Rio Bingo as well as leading affiliate sites


• Casino Choice and Ignite (together the "Bingo Business"). The Bingo Business was founded in 2009


• offers online bingo 24 hours a day with cash prizes and experiences over 9,000 daily unique players. Since 
Mandalay launched its first bingo offering, Mandalay has had 1.1 million users register to its bingo sites and has 
collected approximately £120.0 million in deposits. 


 For the fiscal year ending August 31, 2013, the Bingo Business generated approximately £16.1 million in revenue and 
approximately £7.9 million in net income (implied profit margin of 47.8%)


 Management expects further growth in revenue and income as a result of a £3.0 million marketing campaign that Mandalay 
undertook in the last six months ending February 28, 2014 versus approximately £1.1 million spent for the entire fiscal year 
ending August 31, 2013. 


 The Bingo Business, other than Casino Choice and Ignite, operates off of the Dragonfish platform, a leading bingo software 
service provided by The 888 Group. 


 CEO FitzGerald stated: “This bingo acquisition will add a missing gaming vertical, a bingo-focused marketing team, diversify 
our current casino offering and is expected to be materially accretive to earnings per share and free cash flow”


Financing Structure:
 Intertain sold C$52.3m Equity Subscription Receipts at C$7.00 per unit (which also included ¼ warrant at C$7.75/sh
 Intertain sold C$51.2m Equity Linked Debt Receipts, C$1,000 per receipt, paying 8.5% semiannually, maturing 6/30/19

 Both deals were lead by Canaccord, surprise surprise

 On the surface, the Mandalay business appears to be trending well with recent double digit revenue growth.


 Some might point to the latest quarter and speak to the growth; however, there a few factors which illustrate the growth 
is not fundamental which include:


• There have been significant FX tailwinds. In particular, by viewing the recent sales data in reported pounds, we find 
almost no growth in the past few quarters


• Recent segment income of 10% is suspiciously below the 47.8% profit margin obtained in 2013 according to the 
deal announcement’s press release

• Generates approximately 75% of its sales from the Nordic region, which will give Intertain access to a growing and large market 


• Offers 800 games and has approximately 490,000 registered customers. Vera&John receives approximately 10,000 deposits per day 
and reached 1.0 billion real-money spins in 2014 


• In 2013, Vera&John grew total net gaming revenue from €11.6 million in 2012 to €25.9 million in 2013 (124% growth). In 2013, 
Vera&John generated €4.6 million of EBITDA


 Deal Terms:


 Initial Payment of €44.5 million in cash

€1.00 = $1.4148). 


 Earn-Out subject to a cap of €8.1 million :


 In the event V&J generates EBITDA over certain thresholds in 2015 and 2016. In 2015, for every Euro generated by V&J in 
excess of €10.1 million of EBITDA, Intertain will be obligated to pay to the vendors, subject to certain adjustments, 4.0x such 
amount in excess of €10.1 million of EBITDA 


 In 2016, for every Euro generated by V&J in excess of the greater of €10.1 million of EBITDA and the EBITDA generated in 2015, 
Intertain will be obligated to pay to the vendors, subject to certain adjustments, 4.0x such amount in excess of the greater of 
€10.1 million of EBITDA and the EBITDA generated in 2015 


 Based on current run-rate results, the Company expects to make the full Earn-Out payment 


 Assuming Intertain pays the maximum Earn-Out amount, the total consideration to be paid will be €89.1 million (C$126.1 million)

 We give credit where it is due, Vera&John acquisition appears to be performing well on top line numbers


 Year-over-year revenue trends in reported euros are trending in the 20%+ range, although comps may get more difficult


 Google trend traffic coincides with stable / growing interest level


 Our only caution is that margins are curious, especially under Intertain management


 Per the acquisition press release, Vera&John reported 39.6% EBITDA margins


 Under Intertain’s reporting, its segment income margin has been negative since Q1’15 and hit a low of -7% in Q3’15 (C$17.7m of 
sales on -$1.3m of period net income)


 Management explained the margin deterioration as a result of a move into the UK on the Q3’15 conf call

 Following completion of the V&J acquisition, Intertain embarked on an even more ambitious and larger acquisition from the Gamesys 
Group


 Feb 5, 2015: Intertain announced it entered into a binding purchase agreement to acquire Jackpotjoy, Starspins, and Botemania brands 
(collectively the “Jackpotjoy Business” or “JPJ”) through the purchase of a newly incorporated subsidiary which will hold all of the brands, 
and player data assets comprised within JPJ


 The parties also entered into a Services Agreement for Gamesys to provide platform services and gaming content to Intertain’s new brands. 
The Services Agreement will have a term of up to ten years and will make Intertain one of Gamesys’ largest business-to-business customers


 Company Overview:


• Acquiring the business-to-consumer assets relating to the Jackpotjoy (UK, Eire and Sweden), Starspins and Botemania brands, 
comprising both the real money gambling and social gaming activities operated by Gamesys and Gamesys Gibraltar under these 
brands


• For the last twelve months ending September 2014, the Jackpotjoy Business generated £130.9m of gross win and £67.0m of EBITDA, 
representing an EBITDA margin of 51.2%, before taking into account UK POC tax that was introduced in December 2014;


• Management believes the Jackpotjoy Business will achieve an EBITDA to free-cash-flow conversion rate of over 90.0% based on 
historical results


 Deal Terms:


• The initial purchase price for will consist of cash and share consideration worth approximately £425.8m


• 13% of the Initial Purchase Price or £56.8 million will be funded through the issuance of Intertain common shares


• There will be a three-year earn-out based on future EBITDA performance of the Jackpotjoy Business after the closing of the 
Transaction and future earn-out payments in years three, four and five after the closing date contingent upon the Jackpotjoy Business 
achieving certain EBITDA targets in such years


• The earn-out structure is complicated, but it could range from C$249-C$632M (based on agreements between Gamesys and Intertain)


• Finder’s fee: 0.5% for the Jackpotjoy closing purchase price amount and the earn-out payments to an unnamed party


 Financing Structure:
• 2/26/15: Raised gross proceeds of C$483m ($15.00 per sub unit) or C$461m ($14.33) after expenses

Given the implementation of the 15% UK POC Tax on 12/31/14, the timing of Gamesys’ founders decision to do this transaction is 
notable. Why would Intertain acquire a business where costs will increase significantly on the initiation of a new industry tax, they 
acquire none of the underlying technology (just brands and player data), and have to pay large on-going fees and an earn-out that 
could almost reach the large up-front acquisition price tag

 Gamesys issued shares and repurchased others 
in Apr 2013 and Mar 2014 respectively


 The implied valuation of Gamesys is:
 2014: C$284m
 2013: C$384m
 These valuations include all of Gamesys 


assets including ones not used by 
Intertain (Virgin Gaming, Tropicana, 
technology platform, etc.)


 Does not reflect ongoing licensing & 
platform fees Intertain would pay to 
Gamesys or an earn-out


 Prior to incremental 15% POC taxes and 
any incremental marketing fees


 Intertain is paying a healthy multiple (just 
considering the upfront payment) and yet it 
does not control all of Gamesys


 As we will later illustrate, while Gamesys Group’s 
sales rose 10% from 2013 to 2014, its EBITDA fell 
by 11%


Intertain appears to have paid more than what management and directors 


valued the Gamesys assets at by at least 2.9x

 The Gamesys acquisitions financials do not line-up with financials attained for the prior entity and there are many 
questions that arise:


• Why has an entity whose growth was stunted in March 2014 continued to grow when the UK bingo market is in 
decline? 


• How is it possible for Bingo profit margins for Jackpotjoy to have doubled following the acquisition of Intertain?
• If profit margins did indeed double, would management not boast this performance?
• How are margin improvements possible in context  of new POC gaming tax and incremental licensing fees?
• Did the rest of the assets not acquired by Intertain have margins substantially below the consolidated 


entity?


Gamesys historical financials are not easily reconcilable to 


the post-acquisition Intertain numbers

 The POC taxes are an integral part of the Gamesys valuation and story which came into effect on Dec 1, 2014
 They illustrate increasing governmental regulation over online gaming which will inevitably place a damper on cash flow 


generation as the government opens their hands to take a piece of the industry action
 Potential impact to Gamesys Operations:


 The new POC tax has a $23-31M impact on Gamesys asset cash flows and although free cash conversion is still high as a 
percent of EBITDA, the percent of free cash flow has immediately fallen 18-24% as a result of the POC tax


 POC taxes have practically had an even larger impact on Intertain than expected with a run-rate figure of $46 million per 
annum – across the entire entity (across Intercasino, Mandalay, V&J and JPJ) are as follows:


POC Taxes have a ~(18-24%) impact on Gamesys asset free cash flows; 


Total Intertain POC taxes are significant estimated at over $40M per year

 The terms of the debt financing provided by Macquarie worsened by 150bps - a net impact of US$ 5 million per annum 
• Raised significant US$ debt (US$ 335m Term Loan +US$ 17.5m undrawn revolver) when a majority of Intertain’s business is 


now in GBP and the parent is in Canada
• Notable that the debt was raised in US$ when the company has no notable US operations and the company is publicly listed in 


Canada
• Despite a repayment of $11M in the quarter, the debt appears to have risen by $29M in C$ terms (during Q3-2015)


Intertain’s cost of debt rose significantly between the Gamesys deal announcement in February to 


deal closing in April 2015. Credit deterioration is the likely reason!

A change in bonusing can have a short-term positive impact on results but can sting 


fundamentals and customer retention for the medium and long-term


 Jackpotjoy’s welcome bonus terms have changed
 Until May 2015: “You must wager 2 times the value of the Welcome Bonus before you can make a 


cash withdrawal (including, but not limited to, any cash winnings or deposits related to the applicable 
bonus) from your member account.”


 As of current: “You must wager 4 times the value of the Welcome Bonus before you can make a cash 
withdrawal (including, but not limited to, any cash winnings or deposits related to the applicable 
bonus) from your member account.”


 A subtle change like this could result in a temporary increase in revenues but would be unlikely to drive 
long-term value

 Intertain’s acquisition of the Gamesys assets appear to be temporary in nature
 The Intertain agreements with Gamesys clearly specify that Intertain has little control over the assets purchased:


 Interestingly, Gamesys control over the assets does not appear to change after the five year earn-out period is over:  “following expiry of 
the applicable Earn-Out Period: Gamesys shall exercise its good faith, reasonable discretion as to the precise details of the marketing, 
operation, development and management of the Branded Sites”


Intertain purchased an asset for a large payment upfront, ongoing licensing fees, an earn-out thereafter 


and it does not control this asset?  Are all funds flowing back to original Gamesys shareholders?

 The timing of the acquisition was unfortunate for Intertain shareholders given Noel Hayden was able to sell the asset in February 2015, 
shortly after the implementation of the POC Tax which would significantly impact free cash flow generation from the business. The POC 
tax could be a direct C$50-60 million hit to cash flows annually


 It is questionable that Noel Hayden joined Intertain’s as a non-executive board member
 Given Noel’s reputation, Intertain had a real shot with the Gamesys assets: “Will Hayden's lucky streak continue? With his track 


record, it probably wouldn’t be a gamble to bet that it will.” (source)
 However, within a few months of the closing of the Gamesys assets, Noel Hayden stepped down from his role as CEO passing it 


to COO Lee Fenton - It seems odd that the founder would jump ship at his first opportunity (source)
 Fenton is also managing the remaining Gamesys assets that were not sold to Intertain
 There appears to be a conflict of interest with Hayden and Fenton both managing their own assets and the Intertain assets


 Intertain acquired Gamesys assets, but not the entire Gamesys entity, the specific assets that were acquired appear to be the mature 
Bingo assets; not included in the acquisition were the majority of assets we believe were growth assets for Gamesys including:


 Caesars Casino.com – Gamesys partnership with Caesars Entertainment Corp, the world’s largest provider of branded casino 
entertainment, to bring the superior quality of Las Vegas style gaming to the UK with Caesars Casino online


 Heart Bingo – Launched by Gamesys in march 2010, Heart Games introduced online games and bingo to Global Radio, the UK’s 
largest commercial radio brand


 Caesars Bingo – The world-renowned Caesars Entertainment Corporation chose Gamesys to launch their first and only online 
Bingo site from CAESARS Palace


 Fabulous Bingo – News International chose Gamesys for a second time to launch the nation’s most fashionable Bingo site, using 
the brand from magazine supplement of the year, Fabulous, found inside The Sun every Sunday


 Virgin Games – Virgin Games is licensed and operated by Nozee Limited on the basis of an underlying software system licensed 
by Gamesys Limited.  Nozee Limited, a subsidiary of Gamesys Limited is licensed by the Government of Gibraltar and regulated 
by the Gibraltar Gambling Commissioner


 Virgin Casino – Virgin Casino is authorized to conduct Internet gaming in the State of New Jersey under a license issued to 
Tropicana Entertainment, Inc (NJIP#13-005).  Virgin Casino is regulated by the State of New Jersey, Division of Gaming 
Enforcement


Intertain acquired none of Gamesys growth assets and 


lost the driving force behind Gamesys’ success – Noel Hayden (founder)

 There is a governance board established by Gamesys and Intertain and the Intertain nominee is Darren Rennick who is

 From our perspective given Rennick’s background, we fail to understand why he is responsible for Intertain’s flagship 
asset in the UK.  How is this responsible oversight?


It appears that Darren Rennick, head of Intertain Bahamas, is the company’s nominee for the key

All that glitters is not always gold – Q3 2015 resulted in Adj. Net Income that was down 8% YoY


 Management was quick to highlight knocking it out of the park with revenue growth, but we note that management omitted any operating or 
net income results in the press release


 A review of year-over-year growth in adjusted net income illustrates that not all assets are growing
• JPJ was down due to incremental marketing spend and December 2014 initiation of POC taxes
• V&J expansions have not worked and the company describes it as such “Vera&John’s ability to secure UK market share has been slower 


than anticipated, however this segment will benefit in the future from the knowledge and experience of other UK brands owned by the 
Company.”


• Mandalay appears to have a decent year-over-year comp, however, this is after years of decline 
• InterCasino marketing spend was increased helping the top line but once again this did not trickle down to the bottom line.  


InterCasino results are likely even worse as the below figures include the Amaya revenue guarantee
 We will focus our analysis on Gamesys as the lion share of revenue comes from this entity. The remaining entities represent approx. 30% of 


revenues (excluding the revenue guarantee)
• Mandalay and InterCasino represent less than 10% of revenues whereas V&J is approximately 15%


 Adjusted net income in a constant currency base would be down 8% year-over-year
• It is not surprising that Intertain chose not to disclose this – but why have shareholder not been asking the questions?
• Why has the company not prominently illustrated that their top line has benefited from the devaluation of the Canadian Dollar

Topic Intertain Management Comment Reality


Debt 
Refinancing


“I'd be surprised if in Q3 next year, we didn't refinance 
our debt facility, which could allow for reduced rates 
and-or an increase in facility size.”


There is no guarantee credit markets will be receptive to a
refinancing and offer better terms.  


Takeover Target “For these reasons, I believe we may be at risk for a 
predatory buyer, especially as we trade in the mid digits 
on 2015 earnings whilst most of our peers trade in the 
high teens. ”


Intertain’s stock trades on artificially high earnings that aren’t tax 
adjusted. Furthermore, we believe it should trade at a discount 
given the issues we’ve identified. We don’t believe there are any 
current interested buyers for Intertain; rather, the comment was 
made to entice investors to stick around


Growth through 
acquisition


“We continue to review accretive and strategic 
acquisitions that we can fund to a number of outlets”


It is integral that Intertain keep the growth through acquisition 
story alive. The reality is that Intertain needs to prove to 
investors it can integrate and execute on its recent deals


We will be 
promoting the 
stock


“We are about to embark on a long marketing programs 
throughout North America and Europe highlighting our 
business”


Intertain appears to be still reeling from the MIP disaster, and 
marketing to investors appears to be a preferred use of time 
than focusing on operations


Update on 
Management 
Incentive Plan


“We expect to have the dialog with our shareholders 
throughout the month of November and the contractual 
documentation done no later than the end of the year.”


After spending six months evaluating options for their first 
management incentive plan which was fraught with issues and a 
conflict of interest; Intertain is spending more shareholder cash 
on evaluating the same options over another half a year


Jackpotjoy
Growth


“Well, Q2 only grew 10%, but Q1 grew 20%, Q4 grew 
20%. So, as I said before, this is gaming and it is a game 
of chance, we are pure chance.”


Management appears to have limited knowledge of how Q4 
results will be


Reiterating 
Guidance


“I'd like to mention that we are reiterating our guidance 
for 2015”


Cutting guidance after the MIP debacle would be financial 
suicide. Without significant FX tailwinds as benefits, and some 
questionable acct’g maneuvers such as changing its functional 
currency, it is questionable how Intertain could maintain 
guidance. Let’s see how Intertain is able to hit lofty 29% and 23% 
2016E sales and EPS growth targets

Cash flow from operations does not appear to be utilized for the purposes 


that management suggested in its Q3 press release


 The Q3 2015 results announced on Oct 29, 2015 highlight the company’s direction of its operating cash flows


 However the above statement describing the use of ‘operating cash flows’ appears inaccurate


 Per Intertain’s footnote on Restricted Cash below, it clearly states it is to set aside 65% of excess cash flow in a non-operational 
bank account. However, between Q2’2015 and Q3’2015 its Restricted Cash account on the balance sheet grew by just C$0.7m


 Given that the Restricted Cash account barely increased, how can Intertain claim it “Set aside C$18.2m to fund the earn-out”


 Further, it appears the earn-out was funded by cash on Intertain’s balance sheet (not from operating cash flows)

72


In our view the share repurchase, a response to the Management Incentive Plan debacle, is a poor use of cash in 


the long run and would have been better directed towards deleveraging


 Sep 16, 2015: Intertain announced a limited Normal Course Issuer Bid (NCIB) otherwise known as a share buyback 
program to purchase and cancel up to 3,617,640 common shares, which represents approx. 5% of shares outstanding


 We estimate through the first month of the NCIB, Intertain aggressively purchased shares often representing 10-20% of 
daily volume


 Once the repurchase is completed, what new buyers will emerge and want to own Intertain’s shares? 
 This use of cash is interesting given the company is required to put aside a good portion of excess cash flow for debt 


repayment and the earn-out which still remains unfunded


 Cash pressures unlikely to go away any time soon
• Mandatory term loan debt amortization of approximately $8.3m per quarter and interest expense of $5.6m
• Q4 2015: It appears that Intertain could owe up to £15 million on its Mandalay earn-out in Q4 2015, further putting 


pressure on their poor cash management; on going share buyback
• Q1 2016: Potential V&J earn-out up to €8 million and the Amaya revenue guarantee falling off

Item Timing Implication


Multiple Auditor Changes 2013-14 IT has cycled through three auditors which should be a cautionary sign for investors


Bridge Loan 
Misclassification


Q4’14 IT classified a bridge loan (a short-term obligation) as a long-term liability, distorting its financial 
condition. Adjusting the balance sheet, would’ve resulted in a (C$ 16.9m) working capital deficit


Mysterious Change in 
Revenue Recognition and 
Amortization of 
Intangibles


Q3’14 IT disclosed a cryptic change in revenue recognition and amortization of intangibles deep in its financial 
footnotes. The company did not clearly specify the changes, but said it had no impact on its reported 
balance sheet but did not disclose the actual impact on revenues or earnings. Piecing together some 
language changes we observe the following:
• Q4-14: Revenues from online bingo and casino consists of the difference between total amount 


wagered by players less all winnings payable to players, bonuses allocated, and jackpot contributions 
(“Net Revenue”)


• Q3-14: Revenues from online casino and poker operations consists of the difference between total 
amount wagered by players less all winnings payable to players, bonuses allocated, gaming taxes, 
and jackpot contributions (“Net Revenue”)


Change in Revenue and  
Recognition Among Carve-
Out Financial Statements


Q2’15 The Jackpotjoy carve-out statements mysteriously boosted revenue by £4.7M with a vague explanation 
that suggested IT changed it from net to gross revenue recognition. Upon reviewing Gamesys revenue 
recognition policies and the carve-out entities, it appears IT has made subtle changes (eg. Recognize 
revenues on transaction date vs. settle date) that could accelerate revenue


Purchase Price Accounting  
(PPA) for Jackpotjoy 
transaction changes 
significantly


Q2’15 Purchase Price Accounting (PPA) for the Jackpotjoy transaction changes significantly. Key payable 
accounts related to expenses disappeared. There are many financial questions related to this deal, 
including how Jackpotjoy’s revenues increased 9% while its accounts receivables and payables 
ballooned by 39%  and 35%, respectively. Additionally, Jackpotjoy’s margins have expanded 
dramatically post acquisition


Change in 
Functional Currency


Q3’15 IT disclosed a change in functional currency for the parent co. to US$. Its justification was based on its 
US$ financing deal, whereas we believe it should be based on the operating revenue or costs of the 
underlying businesses which suggest that British Pounds are the dominant currency
75


Item Timing Implication


Lack of Key Performance 
Indicators 


All Periods IT does not report operational data to allow for better evaluation of its operating 
business. For example its competitor Bwin reports active player days, daily average 
players, yield per active player and new player additions


Adjusted Net Income 
Presentation Appears 
Overstated


All Periods In presenting its Adjusted Net Income and EPS figures, IT does not tax adjust its 
figures to present results on an after-tax basis. IT discloses its corporate tax rate at 
26%. By our estimate, its true Adj. EPS is approximately 50% lower


Moving from “Gross Win” to 
“Revenue” for Jackpotjoy


Q3’15 From deal announcement in Feb 2015 through Q2’15, IT disclosed “Gross Win” as the 
headline number to evaluate the Jackpotjoy business, yet never provided a clear 
definition. Starting  in Q3’15, IT now discloses the headline figure in terms of 
revenues


Inconsistent Adj. EBITDA 
Presentation


Q2’15 IT increases Adj. Net Income by the PV adjustment for the contingent consideration, 
but didn’t increase Adj. EBITDA by the same amount until Q2’15


Inconsistent Presentation of 
FX gains/losses


Q1’15 In FY 2014, IT presented its loss on FX as a non-operating item below interest 
expense. Starting in Q1’15, IT reclassified FX gains/losses as operating expenses


Point of Consumption 
(POC) Tax


Q1’15 IT has sought to downplay the significance of the 15% UK POC tax affecting its UK 
gaming operations. Despite owning Mandalay for most of 2014, IT didn’t discuss the 
POC much until well into 2015 after it went into effect 12/31/15.  Did they not know 
or worse?


Numerous Errors Multiple Examples Errors and restatements reported in relation to intangible assets, goodwill and 
acquisition cost reporting  


Early Release of Q3’15 
Financial Results


Q3’15 Last quarter, IT experience an issue that resulted in the early release of its financial 
results. This issue increases our concern that IT may have financial control issues

Three auditors in three years, are problems brewing?


 Intertain’s auditor was again changed within 2 weeks of the following reporting error
• Nov 12, 2014: Intertain announced adjusted Q3 2014 ($6.955m) financial results with adjusted EBITDA up 50% over Q2 


2014 ($4.609m)
• Nov 20, 2014: Intertain slips in an announcement about erroneous EBITDA in a press release about warrant exercise


• Interest accretion was inadvertently added back twice to calculate adjusted EBITDA figures in the Q3 MD&A and 
the error, which is deemed to be immaterial, was overlooked both by management and Intertain’s auditors 
reviewing the MD&A. There are no resulting corrections to either the financial statements or adjusted net income 
per share.


• The adjusted EBITDA’s are Q3 2014 ($6.444M) and Q2 2014 ($4.242M), which represented changes of 7% and 8%

 From the business acquisition report of Vera & John, “The auditors of the Dumarca Audited Financial Statements have not 
given their consent to include their audit report in this Report. ” – how many billion dollar companies have notes like this?


 The prospectus also illustrates that V&J also used multiple auditors “Other Matter: The consolidated financial statements of 
the Group for the year ended 31 December 2012 were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on 
those statements on 19 February 2015.” (source)

Bridge Loan as Long-Term Debt Bridge Loan With 4-5 Year Maturity?


Source: Q1’2015 Financials Source: 2014 Annual Report (p. 62)


 A bridge loan is typically a short-term loan used during a period where a company seeks long-term committed funding
 With respect to the Vera&John acquisition, IT disclosed that its management had provided an arm’s length bridge loan to the company in 


the amount of approximately C$10 million, at the prime Canada business rate, and maturing on December 22, 2019
 On April 8, 2015, upon closing of the Jackpotjoy acquisition and with proceeds raised, the bridge loan was repaid
 Curiously, IT classified its bridge loan as a long-term liability. A long-term liability is by definition any liability maturing over 1 year. In this 


case, IT’s bridge loan was issued and settled in little more than 3 months
 We conclude that IT’s financial statements appear to be materially misstated during this period. Adjusting IT’s balance sheet by


reclassifying the bridge loan as short-term would have substantially worsened IT’s negative working capital deficit to (C$16.9m)

“Gaming revenue for InterCasino was previously 


presented net of certain affiliate fees and other 


revenue related expenses amounting to $737,788. 


Following the acquisition of Mandalay, the Company 


has aligned the accounting policy with that of 


Mandalay to show revenue gross of expenses which 


are included in selling and marketing expenses. In

The Company earns its revenue from operating 
casino and bingo online websites, and affiliate 
services. Affiliate services revenue is derived from 
affiliate services provided to gaming operators. 
The commission revenue is calculated in line with 
the contracts, typically based on fixed price per 
player and is recognized to the extent that its 
probable economic benefits will flow to the 
Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue is recognized in the accounting periods 
in which the transactions occur. Revenues from 
online bingo and casino consists of the difference 
between total amount wagered by players less all 
winnings payable to players, bonuses allocated, 
and jackpot contributions (“Net Revenue”).

A text compare indicates that gaming taxes were also removed from the netting in revenue. This simple change would 
inflate revenues and appears to be a material change in light of the UK’s implementation of the POC tax that would be 
enacted in Fiscal Year 2015

 Intertain’s revised Business Acquisition Report (BAR) notes a restatement that increases both revenue and distribution costs by £4.7M


 Although carve out statements often come with significant amounts of qualifications, we think that a change in revenue recognition at this 
time increases our suspicions on how revenue numbers are being managed. Especially when that change happened between initial and
revised carve out statements. The ‘Rest of the World’ revenues increase mysteriously by over 20%

 The revenue recognition for the carve out is much looser since Intertain accounts for revenue when ‘the transaction 
occurs’ vs Gamesys which accounts for revenues when ‘wagers are settled’


 It would appear that this allows for faster revenue recognition by the JPJ unit of Intertain


Something appears wrong – no matter where we look, there appears to either be negligent error or 


worse which is a function of poor oversight and management

“Intertain re-filed its business acquisition report in connection with the Jackpotjoy Acquisition of Fifty States Limited, completed on 
April 8, 2015 to include a pro forma consolidated financial statement for the annual period ended December 31, 2014 which was
unintentionally omitted when the report was filed on September 4, 2015. The re-filing is a result of review by staff of the Ontario

According to IFRS, the following factors should determine functional currency choice, sales being the leading indicator: 


Functional currency is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates. The primary 
economic environment in which an entity operates is normally the one in which it primarily generates and expends cash. 


An entity considers the following factors in determining its functional currency: (a) the currency: (i) that mainly influences 
sales prices for goods and services (this will often be the currency in which sales prices for its goods and services are 
denominated and settled); and of the country whose competitive forces and regulations mainly determine the sales prices of 
its goods and services. (b) the currency that mainly influences labour, material and other costs of providing goods or services 
(this will often be the currency in which such costs are denominated and settled). 


Pay close attention!
IT justifies its choice of 
functional currency by 
referencing the non-
consolidated parent company 


Source: IFRS “The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates” 


Pay close attention to the rules!
Revenues and cost of sales sold expenses (not financing expenses) are the primary functional currency criteria

 IT’s change in functional currency of the parent company to US$ is unusual insofar as the company is primarily doing 
business in British Pounds as a result of the Jackpotjoy and Mandalay acquisitions  


 This is confirmed by the CFO’s quote from the Q1’2015 Earnings Conf Call:


“I think post Gamesys fair to say that you know low to mid 70s percent of our revenue will be U.K. based.”


 Furthermore, on a consolidated basis in Q3’2015 interest expense on long-term debt amounted to just C$8.3m or just 6.1% 
of total operating and financing expense on a consolidated basis


 Although we are not accountants, our understanding is that any re-measurement of FX gains or losses from a functional 
currency change, should go through the Comprehensive Income account in equity and not through the income statement.  
It is noteworthy that IT uses the FX charge for purposes of increasing its Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Net Income figures

IT has presented its EBITDA inconsistently and is overstating its Adjusted Net Income and EPS by not Tax-Adjusting Items
 To illustrate, IT made a subtle change in its Adjusted EBITDA calculation. IT now adds back the fair value adjustments for 


contingent consideration 
 As can be seen in the table below on the left, IT had not increased its EBITDA by this change, whereas on the right side 


table they are now increasing Adjusted EBITDA by this fair value adjustment
 Furthermore, IT’s Adjusted Net Income appears overstated as a result of not tax-adjusting the pre-tax itemized 


deductions. This is a kin to comparing apples (pre-tax items) to oranges (post-tax) items

Why Intertain has changed disclosure from ‘gross win’ to ‘revenue’ is unknown, however, it does 


appear to allow Intertain to claim significant growth – color us skeptical


 Gamesys Acquisition Announcement:   For the last twelve months ending September 2014, the Jackpotjoy 
Business generated £130.9 million of gross win and £67.0 million of EBITDA1, representing an EBITDA margin 
of 51.2%, before taking into account UK point-of-consumption tax that was introduced in December 2014;


 Q1 2015 Press release: For  the  three months  ended March  31, 2015,  the  Jackpotjoy  Business generated 
£35.7 million of gross win and £13.9 million of EBIT.

 Q3 2015 Press release:  Jackpotjoy generated revenues of £40.7 million for the quarter compared with £33.6 
million in Q3 2014, representing 21% growth.


 Why did Intertain wait until Q3 2015 to change from Gross Win to Revenues?

Between announcement and closing of the Gamesys assets acquisition, Intertain disclosures 


mention POC taxes a few times – and appear to downplay its significance


 Feb 5, 2015: When Intertain announced the acquisition of the acquisition of the Gamesys Assets, POC was 
mentioned once and on a gross basis: “For the last twelve months ending September 2014, the Jackpotjoy Business 
generated £130.9 million of gross win and £67.0 million of EBITDA, representing an EBITDA margin of 51.2%, before 
taking into account UK point-of-consumption tax that was introduced in December 2014; ”


 March 2015:  Annual Report makes just one mention of the POC and downplays its significance, “The new 15% UK 
Place of Consumption (POC) tax for UK facing gaming operators went into effect on December 1, 2014. The POC tax 
actually provides Intertain with opportunity for future acquisitions because it also puts pressure on the bottom line of 
some of our competitors. We have the ability to leverage our size, which is significant in the UK market”


 Apr 17, 2015: the credit agreement filed between Macquarie and Intertain makes one reference to the POC tax 
where they adjust EBITDA for three quarters of 2014


 Apr 17, 2015: the ‘Real Money Gambling Services Agreement’ and ‘Social Gaming Services Agreement’ makes 
reference to it: “All fees payable by Gamesys to Intertain and/or by Intertain to Gamesys shall be inclusive of any 
applicable VAT, sales tax and any other applicable consumption-based taxes”


 May 13, 2015: Intertain provided its Q1 2015 results along with guidance for the 2015 year.  In this press release, the 
POC taxes were referred to once “Revenue guidance is listed gross of UK Point of Consumption tax”


 The initial pro forma statements allocated nil ‘gaming taxes’ for the JPJ entity

 Ongoing issues with acquisition related costs and potential stuffing continues


• Q3 2015 had C$3m of acquisition related costs with only C$2.6m of acquisitions (for Parlay software)


 The new auditors and management of Intertain continue to produce erroneous filings, how can their filings be trusted?


Once again, either negligent errors or worse
98


Significant unfunded earn-outs which limit Intertain’s share price upside; 


earn-outs have increased in size over time


 The majority of Intertain earn-outs are currently unfunded and Intertain will either have to tuck away significant operating cash flow or 
raise additional financing assuming earn-outs turn out to be payable


 In our opinion, based on the magnitude of the potential big earn-outs, they are a lose-lose situation for Intertain
• Either Intertain meets unrealistic expectations and pays earn-outs which significantly limit its upside; or
• Intertain fails to meet expectations and the stock is not worth as much


 It appears that the first of the Intertain earn-outs to Mandalay Media will come due in Q3 2015
• The earn-out must be paid within 5 business days following settlement of statements for the period
• The period for the earn-out is 18 months ended Oct 31, 2015
• The maximum amount of the earn-out is £15m (approximately C$30m)


 The V&J earn-out has a cap of €8.1m (approximately C$12m) – it may be due in Mar 2016 and 2017 respectively
 The Jackpotjoy (JPJ) earn-out could be significantly above the estimate here and that is highlighted in the following slides

Gamesys earn-out appears significantly larger than suggested and is likely unfunded


 The below table highlights the potential size of the Gamesys asset earn-out as reflected by the examples provided in the acquisition 
agreements


• These amounts significantly outpace the provisions taken by Intertain, which currently stand at C$294m at 9/30/15
• These amounts remain unfunded and appear unlikely to be funded through cash flow of Intertain as per our review of current 


operations
• It is difficult based off of disclosure to determine how the earn-out calculation will work – for instance, will the ‘EBITDA’ be before 


or after POC taxes


 Intertain is required to set aside 65% of excess cash flow, less mandatory repayments of its long-term debt
• It is specifically suggested that the cash be segregated in a non-operational account
• This cash segregation provision to secure the earn-out could be an indication that bond holders view its repayment at risk

Gamesys Acquisition
 Intertain purchased an asset for a payment up front (C$812m), ongoing licensing fees (C$50-C$60m annually), an earn-out 


thereafter (C$249-C$632m) and it does not control this asset?  
 Was there ever a formal sales process for the assets?  Why would such a coveted asset not undergo a formal sales process?
 Why did Intertain not acquire the technology assets of Gamesys (also known as its secret sauce)?
 Why would Intertain agree not to be involved in day-to-day operations at Gamesys for the first 5 years?
 Why would Intertain not purchase the growth assets (eg. Virgin Gaming, Tropicana, etc.), the blue sky?
 Are the assets not acquired from Gamesys profitable?  If they are, how did profits increase for the carved out financial 


statements (we have Gamesys historical financials that have margins half the percentage of the carve out financials)?
 Does the Gamesys management team, namely Hayden and Fenton, not have an inherent conflict of interest given they are 


managing both assets they own and ones that Intertain “owns” but that they control?
 Why are they no longer involved in operations (especially as Noel was the driving force behind Gamesys)?


 Why did the interest rate on the credit facility with Macquarie increase by over 150 basis points between announcement of the 
transaction and close?  How could debt terms and the underlying fundamentals of the Gamesys assets change so significantly 
over the two months that this change was reflected over?  Was an original issue discount increased over this time?


 What incentives do Gamesys principals have to continue to drive results for Jackpotjoy after year 5? What obligations does 
Gamesys owe to Intertain after year 5? Can Gamesys walk away from Intertain after year 5?


 Why were Jackpotjoy operations suspended in Italy?
 How could a dealmaker like FitzGerald agree to a deal like this?


Management
 Why is WG Limited not noted in FitzGerald’s history?
 Why did the governance committee of Intertain not meet in 2014?
 Why did GGA have to be hired for the same compensation analysis twice?  Was the first report of alternatives not good 


enough?
 Why do FitzGerald and Laslop suggest Intertain is their first public company when they were clearly at CryptoLogic and Gerova 


(both public companies), respectively?
102


Management (cont’d)


 Who are the owners of Parlay and The Gaming Network?  Was FitzGerald or his friends paid out in this transaction?  


 Why has Intertain removed references to its CFO having been the COO/Director at Gerova Financial?


 Why was Darren Rennick apparently placed in such an important role at Intertain (liaison with Gamesys)?


 Is Intertain concerned that a board member and other connections are tied to the ongoing Amaya insider trading probe (aka 
FINRA investigation)?


 Why are the shell company directors still on Intertain’s board (Choi, Dunford, Fielding, Redmond)?


 Why do Andrew Dixon and Robin Tombs not show up in any acquisition documents despite being founders alongside Noel?


 What is the total amount that FitzGerald and Laslop earned from the Management Incentive Plan fees over all acquisitions?  
Have FitzGerald and Laslop invested more in Intertain or extracted more money?  Please provide calculations?


 When will the new management incentive plan be formally adopted; why taking so long to establish a plan?


 What does Ethoca Nominees do?  Why was it created within a few days of the acquisition of Gamesys?  Did Intertain principals 
have a hand in its formation?


Acquisitions


 Intertain is paying a rich price for Gamesys at metrics that would reflect a control premium but IT doesn’t have control– why?


 Why have customer deposits never been a big part of acquisition accounting?  Where are all the customer deposits?


 Why are the owners of the entity usually not disclosed?  Who are they?


 Who is receiving the “Finder’s Fee” paid to an unnamed individual for the following deals:


• 1.0% Finder’s Fee for Mandalay


• 1.0% Finder’s Fee  for Vera&John


• 0.5% for the Jackpotjoy closing purchase price amount and the earn-out payments?


 Why have earn-outs been getting larger as a percent of up-front payment (source)?
103


Valuation
 Why is the company assuming 3-9% forecasted revenue growth for Jackpotjoy for the purposes of the DCF to value the contingent 


consideration (p. 15, Q3’15 financials)? Why is this range meaningfully lower than historical reported (an analyst forecasted) results
 Why did Gamesys issue and buyback stock at valuations for C$284 - C$384 million whereas Intertain has paid multiples of this (and for 


only a portion of the company)?


Cash Management and Liquidity
 Can the company disclose more details about upcoming contractual payments and commitments in quarterly filings (similar to p. 27 of 


the Annual Report) so that investors can better understand upcoming maturities for valuation purposes?
 Why does it appear that Intertain is not reporting as “restricted cash” the money set-fund earn-outs (as per required in the agreement)  


Note: Intertain’s Q3’15 press release said it “set aside C$18.2m to fund the Jackpotjoy earn-out” but the restricted cash account only 
rose by C$0.7m in Q3’15?


Financial Results
 How has the company doubled margins immediately after acquisition from Gamesys (when compared with Gamesys historical financial 


statements)?  How is this possible with the introduction of the POC tax as well as new licensing costs?
 Why were Q2 and Q3 2015 results not currency adjusted to account for windfall from currency on both top and bottom line?
 Why have welcome bonuses (for Gamesys) changed since the acquisition?  How is this accounted for and what impact does this have on 


the presentation of Intertain’s financial statements (notably revenues) for the short and long-term?
 Why were room moderators changed when the prior moderators were so well engrained and appreciated by JPJ user base?
 Have return to player percentages changed at all since Intertain has acquired the Gamesys assets?


Industry
 Can Intertain comment on what appears to be a significant drop in player data since 2013 per external site Loquax?
 How is Jackpotjoy growing when the industry is clearly in decline?
 How does JPJ say it’s the biggest in UK when Tombola appears to be the unanimous winner?
 Based on JPJ high profile cases of women stealing to fund gambling addiction, what steps is JPJ taking to ensure responsible  gambling?

104


Disclosure and Accounting red flags
 Why has Intertain changed auditors three times since going public?
 If Intertain is so bullish on Jackpotjoy, shouldn’t they provide honest and clear disclosure with KPIs? 


 Why does Intertain not disclose gross gaming revenues and additional information typical of a gaming company?
 Why have there been various revenue recognition and disclosure changes?


 Why has revenue recognition changed from when bets are settled to when transactions occur?  Does this allow Intertain 
to recognize revenue sooner or more aggressively?


 Why did carve-out statements of Jackpotjoy increase revenue by £4.7 million in 2014?
 Why did Intertain shift from Gross Wins to Revenues between Q2 2015 and Q3 2015?
 Why did Intertain change revenue recognition in Q3 2014?  


 Why did Intertain not tax effect adjustments to arrive at adjusted net income in Q3 2015?  What is the actual appropriate 
adjusted net income?


 Why did Intertain shift segment disclosure from EBIT to Adjusted Net Income between Q2 2015 and Q3 2015 on the conf call?
 Why did Intertain not disclose Spain metrics for Q3 2015 after disclosing in Q2 2015?
 Why did the Mandalay earn-out increase so much from Q2 2015 to Q3 2015?
 Carve-out statements - Why were cost of sales added to revised carve out statements? Why were costs relating to social 


gaming and platform fees removed from net revenues?  Has this increased revenues? Why did accounts receivable increase so 
much from 2014 to 2015 in the carve out statements?


 Why did the company appear to avoid almost all mention of POC taxes in 2014 when the impact to the business is material?
 Could Intertain do a better job of discussing the foreign currency impacts on its business, esp the Canadian dollar devaluation?


Relationship with Canaccord
 Are there any conflicts of interest between Canaccord and Intertain (we note Canaccord owned over 12% at inception)?
 How much of the C$127m of fees paid by Intertain have been to Canaccord (please add trading fees)?
 Just how material is Intertain to Canaccord’s banking business. For the 12 months ended 3/31/15 Canaccord reported C$238m 


of investment banking fees according to its Annual Report.  
 How much income has Canaccord generated from Amaya, Intertain, NYX Gaming and related entities on an aggregate basis?
 Are there any conflicts of interest in advising the entire family of companies related to Amaya?

“Our investment thesis in Intertain is based on the strong EBITDA to 


free-cash flow through”


Analysts’ and IT Investment Highlights


Almost two years since coming public through a reverse takeover, 


Intertain has yet to demonstrate consistent free cash flow. Cumulative 


operating cash flow amounts to C$12m.  The POC tax and licensing fees 


reduce both EBITDA and FCF


Acquisitions seem off the table until management rebuilds its limited 


credibility after the MIP debacle. This is not surprising given the 


company has spent C$30m buybacks, has significant financial 


obligations (debt+earn-outs), and interest costs


Spruce Point’s Rebuttal


We have many questions surrounding the structure of the Jackpotjoy deal, 


its accounting, and market share. Management does not appears focused 


on integrating its businesses, nor have any control


“Our 12 month $28 price target (a 2016E EV multiple of 14x) based 


on the integration and success of Jackpotjoy is the main catalyst for 


this stock ”


“The company reiterated its plans to seek international expansion 


with the list of potential new markets growing since the last 


conference call.”


“Management continues to look at potential acquisitions but 


stressed that the absence of a recent transaction does not reflect 


that it is sitting back”


“We believe that management addressing the MIP could be the near-


term catalyst that sees the stock move higher.”


Managements ability to integrate current acquisitions is unproven.  We 


question its focus on int’l expansions. Further, int’l expansion appear 


fraught with multiple business risks and competitive pressures


Regulation provides do not make revenues predictable. Regulated markets 


tend to be mature, competitive, and add significant taxes. A premium 


valuation should be predicated on a quality management team and stable 


cash flow producing assets. Intertain appears to lack both.


“Exposure to regulated jurisdictions should increase the certainty 


and predictability of revenues and garner a premium valuation”


Wrong! Intertain’s stock has continued to trade lower even after 


management sought to explain the MIP fiasco.  The 6 month review 


yielded no new information about the new MIP.


Consensus analysts are forecasting over 29% revenue growth in 


2016E.  They are also forecasting an increase in EBITDA of over 35%


Revenue growth is very suspect.  Gamesys asset growth is questionable 


as JPJ appears to be in decline and expansion in new markets seems 


difficult.  InterCasino and Mandalay assets have been in decline for some 


time now.  V&J growth is possible but is not enough to drive the bus here.  


This material EBITDA growth is also questionable – how has Intertain 


been able to significantly increase Gamesys asset profit margins in the 


face of new POC and licensing taxes which are approximate 25-30% on a 


combined basis?  Note 19 of the Q3 2015 financials suggests that the 


earn-out is based off of 3-9% revenue growth – why are research analysts 


even more bullish than management?

Multiples appear low 
because IT analysts use 
inflated estimates.  On 
a tax-adjusted basis, we 
estimate IT trades at 
15x and 12.3x


 Considering the numerous issues we have with the Intertain investment story (management, governance, excessive leverage and 
unfunded earn-outs), we believe Intertain should trade at a steep discount to peer multiples. 


 We think this discount will increase in 2016 as it becomes evident that it is at risk of missing analysts’ rosy sales and EPS estimates


Estimates appear too high given underlying 
performance of current assets, and 
diminishing likelihood Intertain has the 
bandwidth or financial ability for larger 
acquisitions. Intertain’s internal valuation is 
just 3-9% sales growth for its largest asset JPJ


High leverage 
adds risk premium 


to the equity

Street estimates for 29% 
revenue growth appear high: 1) 
limited ability to acquire 
2) Intertain’s own 3-9% internal 
sales growth estimates for JPJ 
(largest asset)
3) FX benefits cannot last 
forever, and  
4) We estimate it is getting a 4-
5% benefit from the revenue 
recognition change(1)


Note: Financial obligations include earn-outs. Cash and shares adjusted for stock repurchases
(1) Based on the £4.7m pick-up in revenue Intertain received from the change at Jackpotjoy in 2014


The Street models over 
200bps of margin expansion 
in 2016, but we fail to see the 
rationale and assume no 
expansion


We believe Intertain should 
trade at a discount to 
peers, for the numerous 
reasons articulated in our 
overall analysis

to vote alongside with Intertain interests for 12 months


 Most of the holders are likely to strongly consider cashing out
 Most of holders that came through the Gamesys acquisition are likely to hold immaterial positions as Hayden has the largest

2015


After nearly 10 years with JPJ closed my account last week…Been with Jackpotjoy for nearly 10 years. It was a classy site, really the best. 
Operative word "was". Not any more. Never played high stakes, never won big, but used to have lots of fun losing my 10 or 20 depo: few 
good winning spins or bonuses. And hosts - best ever.
New hosts not up to standarts. 


Kish1111, Aug 25, 2015 Steer well clear. I've played on other sites but this one is the worst by a long shot.


Walsh1970, Aug 20, 2015 things have changed at Jackpotjoy. Wins on slots have decreased 


Forsureoutlook, Aug 14, 2015 found it to be a money taking machine…look at the chat rooms, constantly stating 'This site is not what it used to be' 


Madkaz73, Aug 1, 2015 I have been a loyal member of Jackpotjoy for over 13 years and i will now no longer put another penny onto the site in light of recent 
decisions to effectively end the employment of 36 home based hosts who in my opinion were the reason that the site was so successful.
The decision has totally ripped the heart out of a once excellent and caring community of hosts and players. The home base hosts were 
friends to a lot of us and there for nearly all of us at one point through the years during difficult situations. That i fear will not be the same 
with the new hosts.


Ubbingob, Aug 11, 2015 I have not been on Jackpotjoy for a few weeks and i must say i am so,so saddened to hear that these home based hosts have left. Also, now it 
is owned by a Canadian company just makes this even sadder. I'm not sure now if i will go back


Penelope, Jul 29, 2015 Have come on here just because I feel so strongly about the 36 home-based hosts who have been put on "leave" with a choice of move to 
work in the Stoke offices or leave the company. I really think JPJ should be stripped of their Best Chat Hosts award this year, as most people 
who voted would have been voting for JPJ based on those long-term, mostly home-based hosts, who were absolutely fantastic…If that's the 
way JPJ is going (cheapening the site!), it's not going to keep its long-term customers


Note: there are some positive reviews, they have been left out of the above

Jackpotjoy’s player enjoyment appears to have fallen which may be the result of short-term 


thinking whereby costs are cut (change to lower cost moderators and lesser prizes) to maximize 


the earn-out payment


User, Date Selected Commentary


Sarah1, Jul 29, 2015 There now seems no fun or personality or laughter in the chat rooms at Jackpotjoy. The original 36 hosts that won the site awards have 
recently sadly gone due to 'home hosts no longer being a business requirement‘…Also sadly the winning odds on slots seem to have 
dropped dramatically since the takeover, maybe or maybe not a coincidence?!.


Sweetpea, Jul 26, 2015 & Jul 31, 
2015


On jpj early hours of this morning chat was up in arms because of all the regular hosts leaving and the taking on of lots of new ones due too 
expansion of the site…Maybe it is true they are only interested in the money and not the loyal members. I have seen a rapid change in jpj and 
i expect a lot of other members have to.


Dibbleman, Jul 25, 2015 Jackpotjoy will take ya money and mute u plus they sacked home hosts unless they moved to stoke. 


Kry306, Jul 24, 2015 Jackpotjoy used to be a top site and ive spent loads and won some good pots, but now 36 home hosts being got rid of.


Westie11, Jun 10, 2015 I'm actually trying to take this to the gaming commission.


Emmad5559, Sep 12, 2015 but this was beyond have never come across such a site that just does not or will not let you win.


Happy Days, May 26, 2015 This site has changed and not for the better. I used to enjoy gamesys sites but not anymore!


Noluckme, May 22, 2015 Another rip off site with the same winners over and over! If your a small depositor you will be lucky to win anything. Slots pay out a 
pittance too. Dont waste your time and money. The only winners are the company itself! This site along with their sister site sun bingo used 
to give loyalty bonuses, but they seem to have disappeared! Not for me I'm afraid!


Donnastep, May 9, 2015 I don't know what's happened to jpj. I took a break for a while and since coming back I have noticed some changes. The loyalty bonuses 
have disappeared and the slots pay out a pittance compared to what they used to. I am still a member but only make small deposits. It used 
to be my favourite site but not anymore.


Mrsj42, May 8, 2015 Would not recommend jpj. Hard to have any quality fun on the site as money disappears so fast, no decent wins or bonuses and the loyalty 
bonuses seem to have disappeared. Save your money and have a look at some of the competitors, they reward old players as well as new. 
Jackpotjoy totally gone down hill i am afraid and i have been a member for over nine years, but not for much longer!


Weeme72, May 7, 2015 but the past few months i don't play as much as wins are few and far between. Slots dont pay out as much as they used to

“the board tends to reevaluate the MIP and until such time

FitzGerald and Keith Laslop have volunteered to forego all bonuses

Intertain has made no material acquisitions subsequent to the 
change in the Management Incentive Plan – this is not surprising


“The board is of the view that the MIP has well-served the interests 
of both Intertain and investors generating substantial reinvestment 
in the company, rewarding management for a performance, and 
contributing to a substantial increase in shareholder value.”


 How would it be in the best interest of shareholders if 
management is given short-term compensation?
 Why did the board approve payment of the MIP in cash?
 How are shareholder interests protected if management 
incentives are not tied to performance of the underlying acquisition 
(other than to see the impact to the share price between 
announcement and closing, which is again short-term)?
 How are shareholder interested aligned with management if 
management is compensated more by paying a larger dollar figure 
for acquisitions?  Would it not be management’s job to negotiate 
the lowest possible acquisition cost?


“Despite approval by the board of the principles and terms contained 
in the MIP in November of 2014, management agreements were 
only signed and the MIP formally approved by the Compensation 
Committee in May of 2015.”


 Despite the  management incentive plan being effective as of 
November 19, 2014, it was not disclosed to shareholders until May 
27, 2015
 Although management provided a press release and hosted a 
call, they did not disclose the amount of cash management was paid 
as a result of the management incentive plan (on the call)

Call Comments Our Interpretation or Questions


FitzGerald: And Keith and I plan on issuing a update of trading in the 
next couple of weeks just to remind people about our business and 
our free cash flow conversion…we plan to release that, I think, on 
September 8.


The September 8, 2015 update never occurred. Why were Laslop & 
FitzGerald paid cash bonuses, did they not want to own more 
equity?


“But honest – the honest statement is, it couldn't be disclosed until it 
was finalized as part of our employment agreement in May. And 
Keith and I were exposed for the previous 18 months, as part – not 
having employment agreement. So that was a concern that we had 
to deal with, but our really first chance to focus on sort of ourselves 
and not our company was in May, after we completed the Jackpotjoy 
acquisition.”


 Does this mean that entering a management incentive plan was 
easier than completing the employment contracts?
 This also appears highly misleading given the company’s 
management information circular suggests employment agreements 
were effective as of Jan 1, 2015 (source)


“[David C. Danziger says] Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop are amongst 
two of the largest individual shareholders of Intertain.”


Were shares issued to owners of acquired companies such as 
Gamesys + V&J considered when making this statement?


“We really are the founders of this business. We didn't take a big 
promote at the beginning like many founders would.”


 The Company was established through a shell transaction 
whereby Aumento Capital II Corporation acquired Goldstar 
Acquisitionco Inc. with the main holders of the Intertain Group 
being FitzGerald, Rennick and Laslop  who received 9% of the pro 
forma company in exchange for their shares in Intertain
 It is noted that Goldstar was given 9% of the pro forma company 
when it appears that only $1m was raised by Goldstar Acquisitionco 
Inc. according to SEC Form D

Management claimed on the MIP call that it had made more stock purchases than cash received as 


compensation, this appears inaccurate as our calculations cannot reconcile this statement


 CEO: This is a very important that every dollar that Keith and I 
have invested in our business, did not come on the back of 
any guarantee of bonus. So, people keep making the 
statement that we've used our MIP awards for the purposes 
of investment. That is 100% incorrect, that our employment 
agreements were only signed in May of this year, as Keith and 
I focused entirely on our business, increasing shareholder 
value, whilst we left – we were left exposed. So, every dollar 
that we've invested in this business came on the basis of our 
own free will and out of our own cash, and not backed by any 
cash that we received by the company…I think combined 
we're around CAD 900,000 that we've invested more into the 
company than we've received whether it's through salary or 
bonus after tax.


 Laslop: Worth reiterating as well what David had said that if 
you look at it on an after tax basis, each -- myself and Fitz 
have invested more into Intertain securities than we've 
received, whether it's from salary or bonus. So, another way 
to answer your question, Kevin, is that we actually already 
have invested the total amount and more of any bonus that 
we've received.


 Danziger: On an after-tax basis, with respect to the aggregate 
salary and bonuses paid by them in 2014 and 2015 to-date, 
Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Laslop have invested more money 
during that period for the purchase of Intertain equity 
securities than they've received in total after-tax 
compensation.
