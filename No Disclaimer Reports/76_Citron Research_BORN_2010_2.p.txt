CHINA NEW BORUN
(BORN) — YOU ARE COLD
BUSTED: NOW IT IS TIME
TO COME CLEAN. THE
SMOKING GUN


Last month Citron exposed potential disclosure
problems with China New Borun Corporation
(NASDAQ:BORN), a corn alcohol manufacturer,
whose reports of tremendous pro�ts boast far-
above- average margins in a heavily commoditized
and competitive industry.  The company justi�es
these results with the claim it operates an
“advanced” manufacturing process based on their
unique proprietary technology.   Citron ‘s �rst
problem with this company was its �led R&D
expense over the past three years, which is
minuscule, while its main manufacturing facility was
on the brink of bankruptcy in 2009.   


The research was than furthered by Alfred Little,
who wrote in some depth documenting that not
only is BORN using an antiquated and largely
unpro�table manufacturing process (“semi-wet”),
but they have been in the process of updating their
factories’ manufacturing to an industry-standard
competing (“semi-dry”) process, as their “advanced
and proprietary” (“semi-wet”) process was nothing
more than old technology that needed to be
replaced.  Worse, Little suggests that the company
has an undisclosed debt of $270 mil RMB, as

re�ected in tax �lings that predate its May IPO. 
Below is a “reported” copy of the tax documents in
Chinese that would corroborate the theory that the
company is sitting on undisclosed debt.

It was presented that BORN is hiding RMB 270
million in undisclosed debt, a liability which o�sets
nearly all of its claimed retained earnings.  If they
have to acknowledge that liability, they simply don’t
have the assets generated by those retained
earnings, the amount of which is claimed to be RMB
288 million accumulated through 12/31/09.


Neither the company nor its analysts have yet
responded directly to the debt questions.  We are
left to believe that silence is a form of complicity. 
Worse, since these revelations have come to
surface we have seen defections from the Board of
Directors.   Whereas the debt issue would make this
stock another Refco, and it MUST be addressed by
management, we will now PROVE that the company
is operating antiquated plant technology and
further is trying to cover up their lie in an attempt
to conceal it.


SMOKING GUN


The company and the analyst were quick to
respond with a link from the Henan Sheng
Wantongtong Machine Manufacture Corp. that
there is never and was never a contract with BORN
and going as far to say that any mention of a
contract was pure fabrication.

[http://www.wttjx.com/DynamicInfos/990544.aspx]


This quick website cover-up states that the
following full length contract was nothing more
than a fabrication by short sellers to damage the
company.  Really?  This whole contract is false? 


The contracts BORN wants you to believe do not
exist:

Citron has a cached version of their website
(before they changed their story), that shows the
contract has indeed existed.

Attention management:  you cannot simply rewrite
history by changing a website.


Piper Ja�ray


Let us now see whether Piper Ja�ray will address
this issue, or bury its head in the sand.  This is not
the �rst time that Citron has been at odds with
Piper about reality.  Just two years ago Citron
exposed a billing scandal at Arthrocare while Piper
defended the medical device company and tried to
discredit Citron, claiming its own internal review
found no wrongdoing.

[http://citronresearch.com/index.php/2008/02/14/citron-
research-updates-on-arthrocare-artc/]


Sure enough, only months later the company got
investigated by the US Attorneys O�ce over the
billing scandal and the stock fell apart with massive
corporate resignations – but no apology from Piper
Ja�ray.  Let’s see if Piper will redeem themselves or
continue to live in denial.


Questions for Conference Call.


Tomorrow, BORN releases earnings, which we
anticipate to be a complete fabrication regardless
of the numbers they post.  Their past pro�ts cannot
possibly have been generated with an antiquated
manufacturing process, much less higher
commodity prices for corn.  Management credibility

appears to be gone on this issue.  Here are a few
questions that can be asked on the conference call:


1. Are you willing to undergo an
independent forensic audit by a
credible international accounting
�rm that speci�cally addresses the
question of undisclosed debt as �led
on your corporate tax �lings ?


2. How do you expect shareholders to
trust management after such a
blatant attempt to cover up your
contract to update your factory to an
industry-standard manufacturing
process?


3. How soon is the company going to
have to raise money?  Why so soon
after IPO?


Conclusion


It is the opinion of Citron that BORN is committing
fraud on the marketplace.  How can shareholders
trust anything that management has said or will say
in the future?  Worse, the analysts covering the
name are looking for the easy way out instead of
actually analyzing the company.  The facts speak for
themselves.
