Biotech Bubble: Alnylam Triples Despite Setbacks And Insider Selling
Feb. 25, 2013 9:30 AM ET7 comments
by: Richard Pearson


The past 12-14 months have seen a very strong rally in the overall markets, sending the
Nasdaq index to levels not seen in 13 years. Biotech stocks have largely been leading the
pack and have provided spectacular returns to those who have been chasing the ultra-
high beta returns.


Since the beginning of 2012, the Nasdaq is up by an impressive 21%. Meanwhile, the
Nasdaq Biotech Index (NBI) is up by a stunning 44% in the same period of time.


As in most stock market bubbles, we can see that the best returns typically come from the
companies, which have the weakest fundamentals. The reason for this is simple.
Companies with strong fundamentals are typically very easy to value such that quantifying
their potential upside is quite straightforward.


But for money-losing companies with little or no revenues, the bet is typically being made
on a series of transformational events in the future which it is hoped will provide outsized
rewards if they are actualized. Certainly no one is likely to predict strong and steady
companies such as Cubist Pharmaceuticals (CBST) or The Medicines Company
(NASDAQ:MDCO) to become ten baggers, or even a three baggers. But for many of the
earlier stage, unproven biotech stocks, similar multi-bagger predictions are very common
at present.


One sure sign of a bubble in biotech stocks is the fact that many stocks tend to show
sustained rises even when there is no news. During such times, news that is even slightly
positive will have a very dramatic and positive effect on the share price.


Some examples of recent biotech high fliers are as follows:


Company Ticker % cng Market cap 2012


Revenue


Pharmacyclics (NASDAQ:PCYC) 510% $6.3 billion $200 million


Arena Pharma (NASDAQ:ARNA) 417% $1.8 billion $13 million

However the surest sign of a bubble in biotech stocks is when stocks keep rising even
when there is a steady stream of bad news, which intuitively should have caused the
stocks to fall rather than rise.


As the bubble mentality sets in, both investors and sell side analysts consistently fail to
properly incorporate new and negative information. Investors continue to buy the shares,
pushing up the price. As they did in the Nasdaq bubble of 2000, sell side analysts simply
re-adjust their target prices to higher and higher levels to keep up with the ever rising
share price.


The best example of a stock, which continually rises despite a stream of ongoing negative
news, is Alnylam Pharmaceuticals.


In addition, Alnylam shows that in a stock market bubble, it is the fundamentally weakest
stocks that show the greater rises. A comparison between Alnylam and Isis
Pharmaceuticals (ISIS) illustrates this point clearly. Both of these companies compete
directly within the RNAi space, yet Isis has a far broader product portfolio which is in later
stages of development.

Market cap $1.5 billion $1.5 billion

* Stock price change since Jan 1, 2012


As can be seen, Alnylam has significantly outperformed Isis even though Alnylam has no
Phase III products and only one Phase II product still active. In comparison to Isis,
Alnylam has virtually no pipeline. Yet the two companies now have identical market caps
and Alnylam's price performance has been near double that of Isis since January 2012.


As shown below, shares of Alnylam have nearly tripled since the beginning of 2012, with
much of the rise coming in just the past few months. In 2012 the shares traded as low as
$8.33, while in 2013 the shares have risen nearly 30% from a low of $18.71.


During this time there has been a stream of negative news which has bounced off the
company with virtually no effect. As the share price has continued to rise, sell-side
analysts have continued to re-price the stock at higher and higher levels, giving little or no
weight to new negative developments. While a small minority of analysts have in fact
raised the alarm about the disconnect between the share price and the company's
underlying condition, these warnings have gone largely unheeded or unnoticed. These
analyst have suggested target prices for the stock at below $15.00.

A significant uptick in insider and company selling indicates that those who are in a
position to know the most are well aware that the valuation has run well ahead of the
company's clinical progress or commercial prospects. For example:


Up until February 2012, insiders were consistent purchasers of the stock up until
prices of $10.75. Since that time, insiders have been net sellers of shares valued at
nearly $2 million in 6 months. The selling began as soon as the price started to exceed
$17.00. Since February 2012, there has been only one insider purchase consisting of
just 4,967 shares
Alnylam's largest shareholder, Novartis (NYSE:NVS), began liquidating its holding,
selling $30 million of stock. As part of the transaction, Novartis knew it would lose its
subscription rights to purchase more shares directly from Alnylam. Alnylam had
previously obtained this subscription right to offset dilution from options issuance.
Forfeiting this right as part of the sale shows that Novartis is comfortable with
permanently reducing or eliminating its stake and is no longer concerned about its
holding being diluted. Novartis also registered its remaining holdings for sale,
signaling its intent to sell its remaining 4 million shares.
In January, when the stock hit $20.00, Alnylam itself also telegraphed that it
recognized the shares were a "sell" rather than a "buy." Alnylam issued $173 million
worth of new shares in an opportunistic equity offering at $20.13 per share to raise
$173 million. The offering represented a very large 17% of the company at the time,
despite the fact that there was no new use of proceeds disclosed. The issuance of
over $100 million in stock without a use of proceeds signals that the valuation at
$20.13 was high enough to merit an outsized financing purely based on the elevated
share price.


With the equity offering behind us, the next major catalyst which will signal a downward
move in the stock will be continued insider sales along with larger sales which should be
anticipated from Novartis.


The reason why insiders, large investors and management are eager to cash in on the
current spike in Alnylam's share price should be apparent. Even as the share price has
tripled, Alnylam's commercial and clinical prospects have without question encountered
significant headwinds.


1. In May 2012, Alnylam's lead product ALN-RSV01 failed its Phase II trial. This product
was the company's most advanced product, and one of only two products by Alnylam
to make it past Phase I.

2. Shortly thereafter, Alnylam lost a lawsuit with Tekmira (TKMR) which had cited
"relentless and egregious misappropriation of its trade secrets". The two companies
had worked together since 2004. Alnylam was forced to pay an immediate $65 million
plus an additional $10 million in potential milestones to Tekmira.


3. The spinoff IPO of Alnylam's Regulus (NASDAQ:RGLS) unit, a joint venture with Isis
Pharma, ended up pricing at $4.00, 60% below the indicated range of $10.00-$12.00.
Alnylam owns 17% of Regulus.


4. As shown below, Alnylam's "5x15 Product Strategy" predicting five products in late-
stage development by 2015 is now looking more like a "1x16 Strategy" or perhaps a
"2x17 Strategy" at best. Yet Alnylam has redefined the meaning of "5x15" and now
continues to use this marketing phrase in a more "conceptual" way.


Under normal market conditions, each of the items above would certainly be regarded as
a very large and material setback to a major part of Alnylam's business. Yet in the current
biotech bubble environment, none of the items above resulted in any meaningful drop in
the share price or any revision by sell side analysts.


At the same time, a number of much smaller (but positive) announcements saw the share
price jump immediately.


When Alnylam subsequently released new data on its hemophilia drug, the share price
immediately soared by nearly 50%, reaching a then-high for the year of over $19.00.


This was the case even though the data were simply the results of pre-clinical trials
only.


At roughly the same time, Alnylam announced positive results for its new lead product
ALN-TTR02. Although the new lead product had simply proceeded though Phase I only,
the stock was buoyed, offsetting the larger failure of its former lead product in the more
significant Phase II trial.


Analysts have largely ignored the relative magnitude of the negative vs. positive
developments. In each case, as the share price has risen, analysts have been quick to
raise their price targets to an even higher price.


The justifications for the most recent round of price target hikes were based on a number
of very small positives such as:


1. A partnering with The Medicines Company to collaborate on a cholesterol drug.
However, this drug is currently only in pre-clinical / Phase I trials.

2. In February, Alnylam announced that: 
- its Q4 net loss had quadrupled vs. the previous year 
- revenues had fallen by 60% from the prior year 
- for the full year, Alnylam lost over $106 million.  
Despite the negative trends revealed in this data (and with no new clinical
developments) analysts once again upgraded the stock causing the share price to
jump by 7%.


3. In January, JP Morgan highlighted multiple new products to be pursued as part of the
"5x15" strategy. Yet the JP Morgan report noted that these products would be either in
pre-clinical or Phase I stages in 2014, effectively precluding them from meeting the
Alnylam's original criteria for "5x15".


Alnylam's "5x15 Strategy" has become a "1x16 Strategy"


Alnylam's product strategy is a very complex and intricate one such that the science is
well beyond the comprehension of many potential investors. As a result, in order to make
things easier for investors to understand, Alnylam came up with a way to tell investors that
"we will be making substantial progress on our pipeline, and we will be making it very
soon".


In January of 2011, Alnylam launched its "5x15 Product Strategy", which stated that:


The company expects to progress five RNAi therapeutic programs into advanced
clinical development by 2015, with the potential for early commercialization
opportunities.


For any biotech company with a very early stage pipeline, this was a very bold public
statement. Getting five therapeutic programs into advanced clinical development within
four years should be considered a major challenge.


Two years have now passed. Alnylam's lead product (ALN-RSV01) failed in Phase II
clinical trials and just one other product has entered Phase II to take its place. The new
product ALN-TTR02 is scheduled to complete Phase II clinical trials in mid-2013. If it
meets its endpoints, it will then proceed to Phase III, with potential commercialization in
2016 subject to ultimate FDA approval.


The "5x15" slogan has been a very useful way to encapsulate for investors Alnylam's very
complicated product strategy. However with just two years left and only one product
having successfully progressed beyond Phase I, it now appears that there is zero

possibility of achieving anything close to the initially stated goals.


As a result, Alnylam's "5x15 Strategy" is beginning to look more like a "1x16 Strategy".
Although with the subcutaneous variation of the product, this could also potentially
become a "2x17 Strategy".


In any event, at the time of the "5x15" launch, Alnylam had a market cap of $500 million.
Following the recent equity offering, the company now boasts a $1.5 billion market cap
even though its realized results in product development will be substantially less, and
occur substantially later, than was initially projected.


Back in May, when ALN-RSV01 failed, Alnylam was a $500 million company with $180
million in cash. Alnylam's entire pipeline was therefore worth just $320 million. Had the
Phase II trial been successful, there would likely have been substantial upside in the
stock. However, when the trial failed, downside was cushioned by the fact that Alnylam
had several other shots in goal, including ALN-TTR02.


Now, in 2013, the risk / reward proposition has been flipped upside down. The valuation
has currently spiked to $1.5 billion. Even if ALN-TTR02 passes Phase II this year, there
will likely be limited further upside given that success has already been priced in.


But if the product fails Phase II, then the downside will need to be very substantial. Unlike
in 2012, Alnylam is now lacking in a near term back-up plan at the same time that the
valuation has spiked. So while the upside at Phase II is now limited, the downside is now
quite substantial.


Absolute valuation vs. relative valuation


So far, the data points presented demonstrate quite clearly that there has been a
significant disconnect in the relative valuation of Alnylam. In each case there has been
some new development which was substantially detrimental to Alnylam, with the result
that the company as a whole should have been worth something less relative to what it
was worth prior to the realization of the news.


Given that the share price continued to triple through such news, it should come as no
surprise that there is an even larger disconnect in the absolute valuation of Alnylam. In
other words, what is Alnylam really worth in absolute terms vs. the $1.5 billion market cap
of the company.

From the following graphic, it can be seen that the bulk of the value of Alnylam is
attributable to one product only, ALN-TTR02. Alnylam's RSV product failed at the end of
Phase II and its status is now unclear. The remainder of its products are now either in
Phase I, or are not even in clinical trials at all yet.


With the vast majority of the current value of Alnylam being attributable to ALN-TTR02,
and with a current market cap of $1.5 billion, the breakdown of valuation components can
be roughly described as follows:


The "other" category consists of products which are still in Phase I or which have not even
begun clinical trials. Valuing these products at $380 million (25% of the value of the
company) is likely more than generous in comparison to publicly listed biotech companies
with similar early stage portfolios. It is also in line with (and slightly greater than) what the
market valued these products at in May 2012, when its lead product failed in Phase II.
Alnylam has disclosed that it expects to end 2013 with around $320 million in cash.


The point of this graphic is that the recent surge in market cap of Alnylam now needs to be
overwhelmingly justified by the results of just one product, ALN-TTR02. If that product
succeeds in Phase II trials, then there may not be much additional upside. However, if the
product fails, then the share price could fall by as much as 54% to around $12.00.

The failure of ALN-RSV01 was entirely unexpected. However, the very low valuation of
the company at the time cushioned the stock from any impact. Now however, there is
virtually no upside to be had from success and tremendous downside to be had if Alnylam
encounters a second unexpected failure in Phase II.


The value of a successful Phase II for ALN-TTR02


ALN-TTR02 and ALN-TTRsc are intended to be orphan drugs to treat ultra-rare
indications (FAP and FAC) affecting just 50,000 individuals worldwide.


There are already multiple competing products being brought by competitors which are
further along than Alnylam. Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) has Vyndaqel which is in Phase III in the
US and is already approved in Europe. Isis, along with partner Glaxo (NYSE:GSK), has
ISIS-TRRx which is proceeding with a Phase II/III study.


Despite the fact that it is farthest behind with a drug that may end up losing in a winner-
take-all race for orphan status, the market is awarding a $800 million valuation to this
single drug, which has yet to even complete Phase II.


By comparison, the entire value of Isis is only $1.5 billion, which includes its own similar
(and more advanced drug) along with a pipeline of more than a dozen other advanced
products.


Ultimate commercialization still needs to await a successful Phase II trial, then a
successful Phase III trial, along with final FDA approval. If all of these things happen as
desired, then Alnylam may begin to receive revenues from it in 2016, three years from
now.


As a result, any valuation above $300 million would be considered overly optimistic based
on its current status.


To further demonstrate this benchmark valuation, it should be noted that when Pfizer
acquired competing drug Vyndaqel, it did so by acquiring all of FoldRX (the developer of
Vyndaqel) and its entire drug portfolio for a total price of $400 million.


At the time, FoldRX's most advanced drug was tafamidis meglumine, which was in late
stages for approval for treating transthyretin amyloid polyneuropathy. Other products in
earlier stages included drugs for Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease and cystic
fibrosis.


At the time, Vyndaqel was in Phase II, just like ALN-TTR02 is now.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1220311-biotech-bubble-alnylam-triples-despite-setbacks-and-insider-selling 10/13


Again, the purchase price for the entire portfolio was $400 million, which would result in a
value for Vyndaqel of around $100-200 million.


As a result, with Alnylam the valuation risk here is considerable.


Even if ALN-TTR02 achieves successful Phase II results, the valuation of Alnylam could
easily be expected to contract by as much as $500 million simply because the current
valuation for Alnylam has far overshot its market potential of its only near-term drug as a
result of the current biotech bubble.


Conclusion


Taking a larger picture view, it is important to keep in mind that Alnylam is engaged solely
in the production of RNAi therapeutics. However, the FDA has never even approved a
single RNAi therapeutic (drug), ever.


In addition, Alnylam has yet to advance a single product into a Phase III trial.


At present, the $1.5 billion valuation of Alnylam is overwhelmingly dependent upon the
near-term clinical prospects of a single drug, ALN-TTR02. Yet the valuation has already
spiked so dramatically amid the Biotech Bubble, that very little upside remains even if the
trial is successful. In fact, given the current valuation of the company, a successful trial
amid a flattening biotech market could still see the value of Alnylam's stock correct by
around 20-30% by itself.


If the trial fails, then the valuation of Alnylam will be determined according to the
company's other drug prospects which are all currently in Phase I or in pre-clinical
development. As a cushion, Alnylam has disclosed that it expects to end 2013 with $320
million in cash, which equates to $5.24 per share in cash.


The result of a failure in Phase II would be a valuation for Alnylam of at most $700 million,
implying the potential for a drop of more than 50%.


Over the past 14 months, investing in Alnylam (and many other biotech stocks) has been
a very enjoyable one-way street. Bad news has simply not mattered.


Yet at some point in time, the valuation simply must reconnect with the fundamental
prospects of the company.


Insider activity strongly points to the fact that insiders are well aware of the overshoot in
the stock. The higher it goes, the more they sell.

Insiders were net buyers at prices of around $10.00 and below, yet they quickly became
net sellers at prices of $17.00 and above.


Novartis was quick to forego its subscription rights in order to sell off $30 million in stock at
elevated prices. Novartis had previously been the single largest shareholder in Alnylam.
The registration of its remaining shares indicates that Novartis will continue to monetize its
stake rather than hold until 2016 to see if revenues materialize.


Last, a few weeks ago Alnylam itself was quick to issue shares representing 17% of the
company, despite no new use of proceeds. This speaks loudly to the fact that a price of
$20.13 is one that should be locked in quickly and in large size, as confirmed by Alnylam
management.


The current price of $23.44 is 20-30% above where insiders, Novartis and Alnylam itself
has been selling shares in large volume. And in the near term there remain no natural
catalysts for further upside movement in the stock, with Phase II results not being
expected until mid-late 2013.


The one-way street appears to have hit a dead end for now, and it is likely time to head
back in the opposite direction.
