•A privately held Chinese company,owned by the founder and chairman of the board of GFRE,
claims to own and operate all of GFRE’s assets and business. This suggests that the chairman sold
investors shares of a worthless shell entity while keeping the underlying business under a separate
privately held conglomerate.Given the difficulty of litigating in China and the complex multi-
jurisdictional corporate structure of GFRE, shareholders may have great difficulty in recovering
any value from the company.


• GFRE engaged in inappropriate self-dealing by massively overpaying for a business owned
by its chairman and his family.


• GFRE has failed to disclose that its largest customer is a related party.


•We visited each of GFRE’s factories and each appeared far smaller than GFRE reported
in its SEC filings. A representative from a local government office confirmed that GFRE’s
production area was substantially smaller than GFRE’s claims in its public filings. Videos of
GFRE’s factories can be seen here, here, here and here.


• GFRE’s CEO appears to have lied on his resume and has omitted the fact that he was formerly
the CFO of China Finance, Inc., a notorious purveyor of fraudulent Chinese microcap compa-
nies. Suspiciously,GFRE’s CEOwas appointed amere seven days after GFRE issued shares equal
to 15% of its outstanding equity to China Finance,Inc. This CEO then struck a deal that appeared
to enrich China Finance,Inc.at the expense of GFRE’s shareholders,potentially creating a“death
spiral” for GFRE’s stock.


• GFRE commissioned two contractors to perform two expensive capital expenditure proj-
ects. Despite a thorough investigation, we have been unable to find any evidence that ei-
ther contractor is a working business. We believe that management may have used these
suspicious capital expenditure projects as a vehicle to transfer money out of the company.


• BDO Limited is GFRE’s 3rd auditor in 4 years. GFRE dismissed its previous auditor,which
had questioned the effectiveness of its internal controls,immediately prior to the release of GFRE’s
FY 2009 Form 10-K, and replaced it with BDO Limited, an auditor that has represented other
publicly listed Chinese companies which have committed or are accused of committing fraud.

Introduction
Gulf Resources, Inc. (“GFRE” or the “company”) is a producer and distributor of bromine and crude salt and a manufac-


turer and distributer of industrial chemical products used in oil and gas field exploration, oil field drilling,wastewater process-
ing, papermaking chemical agents and inorganic chemicals. GFRE operates exclusively in the People’s Republic of China
(“China”). Like many other Chinese companies which have been investigated and delisted by U.S. securities regulators for fraud,
GFRE went public via a reverse merger transaction in December 2006.


In this report, we present compelling evidence that a rival, privately-held Chinese conglomerate owned by GFRE’s chair-
man and founder claims to own GFRE’s business. This suggests that insiders at GFRE perpetrated a fraud on investors: they
took cash from the capital markets claiming that GFRE owned the underlying business when in fact the two Chinese sub-
sidiaries that own and operate the business are privately owned by a company controlled by the chairman. We believe that,
given the difficulty of litigating in China and the complex multi-jurisdictional organizational structure of GFRE, sharehold-
ers are most likely left without a remedy. In short, investors in this NASDAQ-listed company are likely holding worthless paper
in a shell company.


In addition, we present evidence to suggest that GFRE engaged in an inappropriate self-dealing transaction, the details of
which GFRE intentionally concealed from the SEC and investors, that GFRE engaged in dubious capital expenditures that
may have been a smokescreen for transfers of cash to insiders, and that GFRE is exaggerating the size of the company’s oper-
ations. We also present evidence that GFRE’s CEO has lied on his resume and concealed his work experience for, and a re-
lationship with, a notorious puppet master of Chinese small cap frauds.


Who Really Owns GFRE’s Business?
A privately-held Chinese conglomerate,


owned by Ming Yang, the chairman and
founder of GFRE,claims to own GFRE’s as-
sets and business. This suggests that Ming
Yang never transferred the underlying busi-
ness to GFRE, meaning investors hold the
shares of a worthless shell company.


The Shandong Haoyuan Group (the
“Haoyuan Group”), which can be found at
this website,1 claims to, among other busi-
nesses, “specialize in the manufacturing,
sales and management of … Bromides,
Chemical auxiliaries for oilfield, Chemicals
for paper making, Sewage treatment chemicals, specialized detergents,Bromine,Brominated flame retardants … Crude salt,Oil
accessories, Services of oilfield drilling mud…”2 This description is strangely similar to the business of another company op-
erating in Shandong: Gulf Resources, Inc. (NASDAQ:GFRE).


When we dug deeper we found that the Haoyuan Group does not just sound like GFRE, it claims to own GFRE.


The CEO of the Haoyuan Group is MingYang, the founder and chairman of GFRE. Above on the left is a picture of Ming
Yang from the website of the Haoyuan Goup. On the right is a picture of MingYang ringing the opening bell (he is on the right)
at the NASDAQ exchange with fellow GFRE executives,which can be found at GFRE’s website. It is clearly the same person.


MingYang is the founder, former CEO and current chairman of the board of directors of GFRE.3 But rather than transfer
the underlying business to GFRE as the company claims to have done in its SEC filings, it appears that, according to the
Haoyuan Group,MingYang never transferred the underlying business to GFRE. Instead, MingYang and other insiders kept
the business under a privately-held conglomerate.

BROMINE AND CRUDE SALT BUSINESS


The Haoyuan Group claims to own a subsidiary named Shouguang Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited, which has a
name almost identical to GFRE’s primary subsidiary, Shouguang City Haoyuan Chemical Company Limited (“SCHC”),
which accounts for 77% of GFRE’s FY 2010 gross revenue.4


In the following table we compared the description of the Haoyuan Group’s subsidiary, taken from Haoyuan Group’s web-
site, against the description of SCHC in GFRE’s SEC filings. The similarities are beyond coincidence.


The Haoyuan Group claims to own a subsidiary with almost the exact same name as GFRE’s SCHC. The Haoyuan Group’s
subsidiary manufactures and sells bromine and crude salt, just like SCHC. It operates out of exactly the same location as SCHC
and has an almost identical capacity for bromine production. The Haoyuan Group’s subsidiary has a research and development
relationship with Shandong University, just like SCHC. Coincidence?We think not.


Rather, the Haoyuan Group is in effect representing that it owns GFRE’s bromine and crude salt business. Unfortunately
for investors, the Haoyuan Group also claims to own and operate GFRE’s chemical products business.

CHEMICAL PRODUCTS SUBSIDIARY


The similarities are even more striking with respect to GFRE’s chemical products subsidiary, ShouguangYuxin Chemical In-
dustry Co., Limited (“SYCI”). The Haoyuan Group claims to own a subsidiary named ShouguangYuxin Chemical Co., Ltd.,
which specializes in producing chemical products used in oil and gas exploration. That name and business model should look
familiar to GFRE’s shareholders. Not only does it share an almost identical name to GFRE’s subsidiary, SYCI, but the de-
scription of the business is virtually identical.


In the table below, we show the similarities between GFRE’s chemical products subsidiary, SYCI, which accounts for 23%
of the company’s FY 2010 total revenue, and the subsidiary by a similar name that the Haoyuan Group claims to own.


Note that the second column is populated with language taken directly from GFRE’s public filings. The language in the third
column is taken directly from the Haoyuan Group’s website. From the table below, it is evident that both companies claim to
own SYCI.


Both GFRE and the Haoyuan Group claim to have subsidiaries which operate under an almost identical name, operate in
an identical location, sell virtually the same chemical products to the same types of customers in the same oilfields, and claim
to have the same certifications and awards. Put simply, the Haoyuan Group claims to own SYCI.

manufacturing and R&D of Chemical additives for
oilfield, Chemicals for paper making, Pesticide
emulsifiers, Detergents and Brominated flame retardant.
Other evidence of a common claim to ownership abounds. The organizational chart below was downloaded from the
Haoyuan Group’s website. It clearly shows both the bromine and crude salt and the chemical products subsidiaries as part
of the larger conglomerate.


This organizational chart is telling. In it the conglomerate represents that GFRE’s bromine, crude salt and chemical prod-
ucts fit snuggly into its structure.


Our independent investigation revealed circumstantial evidence corroborating that GFRE is operating as part of Haoyuan
Group. When our investigators visited one GFRE factory, they noticed that part of the factory was devoted to building envi-
ronmentally friendly light bulbs. The Haoyuan Goup has a subsidiary, abbreviated above as Caiting Ecological Lighting (de-
scribed on the web site here),which makes light bulbs. This evidence supports our conclusion that GFRE’s business is part of
the Haoyuan Group’s conglomerate, along with other unrelated businesses.


In sum, the Haoyuan Group, led by GFRE’s founder MingYang, claims to own all of GFRE’s business. This is one of the most brazen
examples of small cap Chinese fraud we have seen. The chairman and founder of a public company is advertising on a website that a pri-
vately held conglomerate actually owns the underlying business and that GFRE’s investors hold the securities of a worthless shell company.


WHAT CAN INVESTORS DO?


The outlook is bleak. A dispute between shareholders and a local Chinese conglomerate over assets located in China is an
unappetizing prospect.


Chinese courts are notoriously corrupt, arbitrary and protective of local businesses and industry.9 Notions of judicial independ-
ence do not apply. As a result, for foreign investors, litigating against a Chinese conglomerate in a Chinese court is a Sisyphean task.
Further hindering any prospect of recovery in this case is the Haoyuan Group’s relationship with the local government and state
owned enterprises,which would only magnify its influence over the judicial system. In short, confronted with the choice of either
validating the claim of a class of (mostly) western shareholders or ruling in favor of a powerful local Chinese conglomerate with ties
to both local government and state-run businesses,would anyone bet on a Chinese court ruling in favor of shareholders?


Complicating matters is GFRE’s corporate structure which, like many U.S.-listed Chinese companies that went public via
a reverse merger transaction, essentially shields miscreants from regulators and plaintiff ’s attorneys in both China and the United

States. “Favorable judgments,whether obtained by shareholders or even by government regulators, are usually not enforceable
against many Chinese companies, which spread their assets across multiple jurisdictions, complicate judicial enforcement and
seizure.As a result, even securities regulators seem to be at a loss.”10


GFRE is no different. In the table below we have set forth GFRE’s corporate structure, assuming the company accurately
disclosed its organizational structure to the SEC.


GFRE’s corporate structure would certainly frustrate any regulator or plaintiff ’s attorney working to recover value on be-
half of defrauded shareholders. Any claim to recover assets or cash from Chinese operations would have to go through the
United States, the BritishVirgin Islands and Hong Kong before prevailing in a Chinese court. This seems like a long shot.


Valuation
Given the bleak prospect of litigation in China, coupled with the fact that GFRE’s corporate structure puts the com-


pany’s revenue and assets out of the reach of regulators and plaintiff ’s attorneys, investors will likely have no recourse
against even the most brazen claims by MingYang and the Haoyuan Group to own GFRE’s business. Left naked with-
out a legal remedy, investors’ equity in GFRE may turn out to be valueless. As a result, we are putting a price target of
$0.00 on the shares of GFRE.

PURPORTED GFRE CORPORATE STRUCTURE
GULF RESOURCES, INC.


Skeletons in the Closet: Inappropriate Self-Dealing
GFREhas a disturbing history of inappropriate self-dealing. Immediately after going public,GFREpurportedly acquired a target com-


pany at a massively inflated price. At the time, this target was owned by the chairman of the board of directors of GFRE,MingYang,
and his family. In order to make the transaction appear appropriate,GFRE submitted false financial statements for the target company.


On February 5, 2007, shortly after consummating the reverse merger transaction that enabled GFRE to list on US capital
markets, GFRE purportedly acquired SYCI for an aggregate purchase price of $18,900,000. The owners of SYCI received
8,094,05911 of newly issued shares of GFRE’s common stock and $2.55 million in cash.12 The value of these shares would climb
to as high as $120 million.13


SYCI was 100% owned by MingYang,CEO and chairman of the board of GFRE,14 and his wifeWenxiangYu. At the time
of the acquisition,MingYang and his wife,WenxiangYu,owned 37.2% of GFRE. To further complicate matters,Min Li served
at the time as CFO of both GFRE and its prospective target at the time, SYCI. In fairness, GFRE disclosed this relationship.
This transaction would not be inappropriate if it paid a fair market value for SYCI. But it did not.


According to publicly available records obtained in China SYCI was actually far less valuable at the time of the acquisition
than the financial statements of SYCI filed with the SEC lead investors to believe. In the following table, we have set forth a
comparison between the financials of SYCI for FY 2006 filed with the SEC and the financials filed with the local filing of-
fices of the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”).

13The price of GFRE’s shares in January 2010 climbed as high as $14.49.
14 SYCI was owned 50% directly byWenxiangYu and 50% by Shangdong Haoyuan Industry Group Ltd.,which was owned and controlled by MingYang and his wifeWenxiangYu.
GULF RESOURCES, INC.


The discrepancy between the financial statements filed with the SEC and the financial statements filed with the SAIC is
damning. SYCI made one-thirteenth the amount of revenue and owned less than one-half the amount of total assets that
GFRE claimed in its SEC filings. Further, SYCI’s SAIC filings show that rather than operating as a profitable business at the
time of acquisition, it was losing over $350,000 per year. The SAIC filings show that MingYang and his cohorts lied to the
SEC and defrauded investors by purchasing a company from themselves for substantially more than the company was worth.


Worse still, on January 31, 2007, one week prior to selling SYCI to GFRE,MingYang and his wife took $2,189,000 in cash
out of SYCI in the form of a shareholder dividend.15 Essentially,MingYang stripped SYCI of its cash and then sold it to GFRE
at a massively inflated price.


Note that this occurred almost immediately after GFRE went public. The chairman may have faced a dilemma: the company was
flush with cash from investors but management could not be seen to be selling shares on the open market. A convenient solution may
have been to overpay for a target that was owned by the chairman, thus lining his pockets with newly raised capital while appearing
not to be diluting his ownership stake in the company. This is not the only instance of GFRE engaging in inappropriate self-dealing.


GFRE’s Largest Customer is (Secretly) Related
GFRE’s largest customer is a subsidiary of the aforementioned Haoyuan Group, the privately held company for which the


chairman of GFRE serves as the CEO and which claims to own GFRE’s business.


GFRE’s largest customer in FY 2010 was Shouguang City Rongyuan Chemical Company Limited (“Rongyuan”), ac-
counting for 13.2% of the company’s bromine revenue and 24.3% of its crude salt revenue.16 Rongyuan accounted for 10.6%
of GFRE’s total FY 2010 revenue.


The Haoyuan Group and Rongyuan have the same address, same phone number, same fax number and same website. Even
Rongyuan’s website has the name “Haoyuan” in the URL address. Further, Rongyuan’s SAIC filings show the same regis-
tered address as the Haoyuan Group.


Our investigators called the Haoyuan Group and a representative confirmed in no uncertain terms that Rongyuan is a sub-
sidiary of the Haoyuan Group. Suffice it to say that they are related.


GFRE failed to disclose in its SEC filings that its largest customer is a related party.17 Further, the fact that Rongyuan is a re-
lated party casts doubt on GFRE’s sales figures. Is Rongyuan paying above market for GFRE’s products? Does GFRE have suf-
ficient internal controls to ensure that the sale to Rongyuan are genuine or accurately reflected in the company’s SEC filings?


TheWondrous Life of Xiaobin Liu
We have uncovered numerous material misstatements and omissions in the resume of GFRE’s Chief Executive Officer, Xi-


aobin Liu (“Liu”) including the fact that Liu was appointed under suspicious circumstances and has a murky history with a
notorious perpetrator of small cap Chinese frauds, which was never disclosed to investors.


The following paragraph is the bio of GFRE’s CEO on the company’s website:


Effective March 10,2009,Mr.Xiaobin Liu was appointed the Chief Executive Officer of Gulf Resources.Mr.Liu has been closely involved
with the Company since January 2007.Serving asVice President, he was responsible for all the Company’s operations.From June 2005 to
December 2006, he was theVice President of Shenzhen SEG.Dasheng Co.,Ltd., a Shenzhen-listed company engaged in the real es-
tate and hotel industries. From May 2000 to June 2005 he managed the securities department of Saige InternationalTrust and Invest-
ment Corporation in Hainan province and was in charge of asset management. From May 1995 to May 2000,Mr. Liu served as the
Vice President ofHainanWanquanhe Development, where he was in charge of corporate operations and financial control.Prior to that,he
worked in the finance departments of Chinese Black Metal, Ltd. and ShanxiAircraft Manufacturing Company. He has a Master’s
degree in international accounting from the City University of Hong Kong.Mr.Liu was born 1968.18

GULF RESOURCES, INC.


First, we contacted Shenzhen SEG Dasheng Co. Ltd. (“Shenzhen SEG”), which has recently changed its name to Shenzhen
Zero-Seven Co.,Ltd. Shenzhen SEG has no record of Liu ever working for the company, let alone serving as a vice president for
one year. Shenzhen SEG’s human resources department stated in no uncertain terms that Liu never worked for the company.


Second, Liu’s biography states that he worked at Saige International Trust and Investment Corporation (“Saige Interna-
tional”) from May 2000 to June 2005. Omitted from the description of Saige International is that one year after Liu left the
firm, it declared bankruptcy. Further, there is inconsistency in Liu’s timeline. Businessweek.com states that “Liu served as the
Chief Financial Officer of Da Shen Incorporated, a subsidiary of DaShen Real Estate LLC from 2002 to 2004.”19 We also found
a public filing stating that Liu served as chief financial officer for another company in 2004.20


Third, Liu’s biography states that he worked as a vice president at HainanWanquanhe Development for five years. We have
conducted an extensive search of public records and online sources and we can find no evidence that this company ever existed.


Fourth and most importantly, Liu’s biography conceals,we believe deliberately, a crucial detail in Liu’s past: he served in 2004
as CFO of China Finance, Inc. (“China Finance”),21 a notorious China small cap fraud which traded on the OTC before it
disappeared in 2009, became delinquent under SEC filing rules and was relegated to the pink sheets.22


China Finance has a troubling legacy: it is involved in,and may have orchestrated,one of the largest pump and dump schemes in the
history of U.S.capital markets. China Finance’s principle business was“providing financial support and services - primarily in the form
of surety guarantees or short-term loans - to privately-owned small and medium sized enterprises in China when they seek access to
capital or to be acquired by a United States reporting company.”23 China Finance would take a slice of equity in exchange for help-
ing a small cap Chinese company go public. Once public,China Finance would also provide banking and other financial services.


Many of the Chinese small cap companies that China Finance shepherded to US capital markets turned out to be either outright frauds
or so poorlymanaged that their shares are virtually valueless. This table gives just a few examples of the detritus left in China Finance’s wake.


The table above should alert regulators and alarm investors. It shows that China Finance was involved in a number of Chi-
nese reverse merger transactions that allowed companies to go public which were either fraudulent or are currently being ac-
cused of fraud. Ultimately, most everything China Finance touches turns to dust.


China Finance helped to take GFRE public. In 2006, China Finance, through its subsidiary Haoyuan Chemical Company
Limited, received 6% of GFRE’s equity in exchange for its services in connection with going public.

GULF RESOURCES, INC.


But the real bombshell is this: not only did GFRE’s current CEO serve as the CFO of China Finance, but he was appointed
to CEO of GFRE a mere seven days after GFRE granted China Finance a considerable equity stake in the company. In
other words, it appears as though China Finance, a company that is at the epicenter of the small cap Chinese fraud pandemic,
exerts considerable influence over GFRE.


PAYMENTS TO CHINA FINANCE


On January 24, 2009, GFRE entered into an agreement to issue 5.25 million shares of the company’s common stock at a
price equal to $4.05 per share toTop King Group Limited (“Top King”), Billion Gold Group Limited (“Billion Gold”),Top-
good International Limited (“Topgood”), in lieu of paying off in cash approximately $21.3 million in existing loans payable to
Shenzhen HuaYin Guaranty and Investment Limited Liability Company (“Shenzhen GILLC”), a subsidiary of China Finance
and shareholder of the company.24


Rather than repaying or refinancing debt,on March 3,2009,GFRE issued 5.25 million shares to Billion Gold,Topgood andTop
King,all of which are parties related to Shenzhen GILLC through China Finance and its mysterious backer,Dr.KitTsui (“Dr.Kit”).
As detailed in this article Dr.Kit may be the man behind the curtain of the small cap Chinese reverse merger fraud. Suspiciously,
on March 10,2010, a mere seven days after issuing 5.25 million shares to shell companies controlled by Dr.Kit,GFRE appointed
Liu as CEO. These shares would be worth almost $76 million in less than a year.


One of Liu’s first acts as CEO of GFRE was to make a deal with Dr. Kit which allowed the puppet master behind China
Finance to immediately realize value from the newly issued shares at the expense of GFRE’s shareholders.


FLEX CALL OPTION


One of Liu’s first acts as CEO of GFRE was to negotiate a Lock-Up Agreement, dated May 10, 2009 (the “Lock-Up Agree-
ment”), with Billion Gold,Topgood andTop King (collectively,“Dr. Kit’s Companies”), the entities that received 5.25 million
shares (“Dr. Kit’s Shares”) of GFRE common stock. Under the Lock-up Agreement, Dr. Kit’s Companies agreed not to sell
Dr. Kit’s Shares in a public transaction on an exchange for two years. However, the Lock-Up Agreement permitted Dr. Kit’s
Companies the right to pledge, trade or transfer Dr. Kit’s Shares in a private transaction if the transferee agreed to abide by the
terms of the Lock-Up Agreement. But GFRE’s shareholders got screwed.


Dr. Kit’s Companies, with the permission of GFRE’s CEO, pledged Dr. Kit’s Shares toWar Chest (which, we believe, is an-
other company controlled by Dr. Kit) in exchange for a loan. War Chest turned around and pledged Dr. Kit’s Shares to cre-
ate a European Call FLEX Option (“Call FLEX Option”). The Call FLEX Option permitted HAP Trading LLC (“HAP
Trading”) to purchase 5.73 million shares (approximately 15% of GFRE’s total outstanding equity) for $0.125 each. The pro-
ceeds of the sale of the Call FLEX Option went to affiliates of Dr.Kit and HAPTrading was free to sell the shares on the open
market, creating what we believe to be a death spiral.


DEATH SPIRAL


A death spiral is a process where convertible financing used to fund primarily small cap companies can be used against the
company in the marketplace to cause its stock to fall dramatically, sometimes rendering the company’s equity worthless. Under
the typical “death spiral” scenario a third party acquires an option (or convertible debt) to purchase a company’s common
stock at a steep discount to the market value of the shares. The holder of the option then shorts the issuer’s common stock.


This short position often causes the stock price to decline. The option holder then exercises some of the options to cover
the short position. The option holder then continues to sell short and cover with converted stock which, along with selling
by other shareholders alarmed by the falling price, continually drives the share price down. This cycle continues until the eq-
uity becomes worthless or the holder runs out of options.


In this case, a firm called War Chest, which we believe is controlled by or affiliated with Dr. Kit, pledged Dr. Kit’s Shares to
HAPTrading to create the Call FLEX Option, giving HAPTrading the right to exercise calls at a price of $0.125 each on 5.73
million shares of GFRE. According to GFRE,War Chest created the Call FLEX Option on or around November 10, 2010,
when its 5.73 million shares of GFRE would have been worth roughly $57.3 million.25

25 Shares of GFRE were trading around $10.00 per share at this time.

It is common practice for market makers to take naked short positions to offset long exposure from owning a call op-
tion. In this case, because HAP Trading owns rights to GFRE shares though the Call FLEX Option, a firm like HAP
Trading would typically take a naked short position in the market to offset its exposure to the name. Given that the
Call FLEX Option gives HAP Trading the right to purchase shares of GFRE at $0.125, HAP Trading could profitably
short GFRE in down to that price.


If prices of GFRE’s shares fall because of HAPTrading’s short position, other investors may sell and potential buyers would
likely stay clear, further driving down the price of GFRE’s shares. Like a Q-tip in a toilet bowl,GFRE’s shares may swirl lower
and lower until eventually flushed down the drain.


This is precisely why management created a lock-up provision for the shares being issued. But Dr. Kit used the Call FLEX
Option to lock in gains at the expense of GFRE’s shareholders. HAPTrading believes it is not in violation of the Lock-Up
Agreement. So the question is this: did GFRE’s CEO, with deep ties to Dr. Kit and China Finance, negotiate the Lock-Up
Agreement such that Dr.Kit’s companies could create the Call FLEX Option, thus enriching Dr.Kit at the expense of GFRE
shareholders and possibly sending GFRE’s shares into a death spiral?


The bottom line is simple. GFRE issued 15% of its equity to Dr. Kit’s Companies in exchange for the can-
cellation of a loan. Seven days later, a new CEO, who had previously worked for Dr. Kit’s China Finance, was
appointed CEO of GFRE. This CEO proceeded to negotiate a lock-up agreement which may have permit-
ted Dr. Kit to enrich himself on the shares at the expense of GFRE’s shareholders, potentially creating a death
spiral. Still long GFRE?

Phantom Capital Expenditures?
GFRE has completed two major construction projects in the past two years. Despite a diligent search, our investigators can-


not find any evidence that either contractor is an operating construction company.


InAugust 2009, the Company completed a sewage treatment project at a total cost of $6.6 million. The contractor was pur-
portedly Xuzhou Bishui Environmental ScienceTechnology Co., Ltd. (“XBETech”).26


Our investigators conducted an extensive search and could find no evidence that XBETech exists. Our investigators found
nothing on either Baidu or Google mentioning XBETech. Our investigators called two local telephone directory operators
(the equivalent of 411 in the area where XBE purportedly operates) and neither operator had any record of XBETech. Our
investigators also called the Xuzhou City Environment Protection Bureau,where a local sewage treatment construction com-
pany would have to register, and the government bureau had no record of XBETech. It is our belief that GFRE may have
commissioned phantom capital expenditures in order to transfer $6.6 million in cash from the company to related parties.
This was not GFRE’s last suspicious capital expenditure.


In June 2010, the Company completed the construction of a production line for wastewater treatment chemical additives
line at a total cost of $8.88 million. The contractor was purportedly awarded to Shouguang City Shengkun Construction Co.,
Ltd. (“SCS Construction”).


Our investigation revealed no evidence that SCS Construction is an operating company. A Baidu and Google search revealed
only a phone number that is no longer in service. Suspiciously, SCS Construction’s AIC filings did not reveal a phone num-
ber on record. Typically, a construction company that landed an $8.88 million contract for a high profile public company
would advertise this fact. But SCS Construction is nowhere to be found.


So our investigators called GFRE’s subsidiary SYCI and asked about the project. At first, someone in their operations de-
partment named Mr.Liu told our investigator that the sewage treatment started in the second half of 2010 but had not yet been
completed. In fact,Mr. Liu said the project was still in the pilot stage. He then awkwardly ended the conversation and asked
our investigator to call back the next day. When our investigator called back,Mr. Liu refused to discuss the project. GFRE’s
SEC filings state clearly that the company completed the project in June 2010. But GFRE’s representative said that the proj-
ect was not complete as of April 2011.


SCS Construction’s FY 2010 SAIC filings show revenue of $1.82 million. This is much smaller than it should be. Accord-
ing to GFRE’s FY 2010 Form 10-K,GFRE paid SCS Construction $8.88 million to complete the sewage treatment project.
This discrepancy suggests that perhaps GFRE diverted some of the funds ostensibly used for the sewage treatment capital
project to other undisclosed uses.


Ultimately,we can find no evidence that XBETech ever existed or that SCS Construction is an operating company (although
it clearly exists on paper). We think that it is likely, given the preponderance of the evidence in this report, that the purported
payment to XBETech and SCS Construction were phantom capital expenditures designed to funnel money out of the com-
pany to related parties.

GFRE’s Auditor Turnover
GFRE boasts a record of high auditor turnover, as demonstrated by the following chart:


The details of GFRE’s auditor turnover are disturbing to any investor putting faith in GFRE’s auditors as a bulwark against
fraud. Less than three weeks prior to the filing of GFRE’s Form 10-K for the fiscal year 2009, GFRE dismissed MCO, its
longest-serving auditor.27 The timing is suspicious and suggests that there was a major disagreement between MCO and GFRE
over GFRE’s 2009 Form 10-K. Notably, one year prior to dismissal,MCO stated in GFRE’s FY 2008 Form 10-K that it had
found the following “material weaknesses” in the effectiveness of GFRE’s internal controls:


1. Insufficient complement of accounting personnel with the appropriate level of accounting knowledge, experience and training in the ap-
plication of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States commensurate with financial statement reporting requirements.


2. Inability to timely and properly recognize issuance of share-based compensation.28


MCO warned investors in 2009 that the lack of accounting professionals and the accounting treatment of certain of GFRE’s
equity issuances created a “reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial
statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.”29 Surprisingly, rather than address such weaknesses, GFRE’s
management dismissed them as immaterial.30


One year later, right before MCO would have another opportunity to warn investors of fraud, GFRE replaced MCO with
an accounting firm notorious for its representation of other Chinese companies accused of fraud.


In February 2010,GFRE hired BDO Limited (“BDO”), the Hong Kong member firm of the BDO International network
of auditors. BDO Limited completed its audit in just three weeks, an unusually short period of time for a newly hired ac-
countant with no familiarity with the company’s books, records or accounting practices.


BDO has a track record of signing off on the financial statements of companies which were committing fraud or are cur-
rently being accused of committing fraud.


BDO audited China Expert Technology (“CXTI”), a notorious small cap Chinese fraud.31 CXTI’s shares soared to $7.00
on the strength of spectacular financial results. But CXTI was a hoax. The company did not exist. CXTI’s financials were
conjured from thin air. The CEO and CFO subsequently disappeared and CXTI ceased to file financial statements, wiping
out its investors. CXTI’s shares are now almost worthless.32 How could investors have confidence in an auditor that signed
off on a company that literally did not exist?


BDO Limited’s less than sterling record does not end with CXTI. BDO Limited is the auditor of China Biotics (“CHBT“),
and Orient Paper (“ONP“), both of which have been accused of fraud by investors in the past twelve months.

The table above should scare investors. BDO Limited signed off on the financial statements of CXTI, a Potemkin village.
Further, BDO Limited has accumulated a roster of clients that, in the last year alone, have seen the value of their shares drop
precipitously as a result of accusations of fraud.


This track record may not come as a surprise considering that BDO Limited is not regulated by the PCAOB. Without a legit-
imateAmerican regulatory authority with dominion over their operations,many Chinese auditors,under pressure to please clients,
often refrain from conducting deep due diligence, ignore suspicious numbers, and make favorable assumptions on their clients’ be-
half. In short,without the risk of censure or punishment, given that they do not answer to any U.S. regulatory body, the carrot of
substantial fees can lead Chinese auditors to prioritize client retention over accurate disclosure and a thorough investigation.


In GFRE’s case, the timeline speaks for itself. In 2009,MCOwarned investors that due to insufficient internal controls there was
a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement in GFRE’s financial statements would not be detected or prevented on a timely
basis. In 2010, just three weeks prior to the release of GFRE’s FY 2009 Form 10-K,GFRE fired MCO and hired BDO Limited,
a firm notorious for its involvement with publicly listed companies that committed fraud or that currently face accusations of fraud.
BDO Limited completed its audit of GFRE in only three weeks. By contrast, it took Deloitte &Touche (discussed below) from
September 2010 until February 2011 to issue a report, not a full blown audit, on the company’s internal controls. Caveat emptor!


DTT &The Curious Case of Richard Khaleel
Investors long on GFRE may argue that the company is on the right track because it hired Deloitte Touche & Tohmatsu


(“DTT”), a “big four” auditor, in September 2010 to investigate and report on the company’s internal controls. We disagree.


First, GFRE kept DTT’s findings a secret. If DTT had given GFRE a glowing report, we suspect that GFRE would have
rushed to publicize it. The fact that GFRE chose to keep DTT’s report a secret suggests DTT’s assessment of GFRE’s inter-
nal controls were negative. Second, GFRE did not disclose DTT’s recommendations so there is no way for investors to know
whether GFRE adopted DTT’s advice.


Third, after receiving DTT’s report,Richard Khaleel, an independent director and member of the audit committee of the board
of directors of GFRE, resigned from the company,ostensibly because he served as a director of another public company that asked
him to resign. We have no direct evidence to suggest that Mr.Khaleel resigned because of the contents of DTT’s report or that any
disagreement arose between Mr. Khaleel and GFRE regarding the company’s accounting practices or internal controls or the ac-
curacy of the company’s financial statements. In fact, inMr.Khaleel’s resignation letter says that he left for reasons unrelated to GFRE.


But the timing of Mr.Khaleel’s resignation is noteworthy and suspicious, if you believe, as we do, that something is rotten with
GFRE. Mr.Khaleel resigned less than a month after receiving DTT’s report and a mere two weeks prior to the filing of GFRE’s
FY 2010 Form 10-K. If Mr.Khaleel was disturbed by DTT’s findings and suspected that GFRE was falsifying its financial state-
ments, he would certainly want to resign before GFRE filed such financial statements with the SEC. No doubt he would
know that as the only American citizen on the board of directors, he would be the only director under the ju-
risdiction of the SEC and plaintiff ’s attorneys. He would know that as a member of the audit committee, he would be
exposed if GFRE defrauded investors. In other words, if DTT’s report crucified GFRE for its internal controls and questioned
the authenticity of its financial statements, the rational decision for anAmerican director would be to resign prior to the release
of such financial statements. Mr. Khaleel resigned effective March 2, 2011.33 GFRE filed its Form 10-K on March 16, 2011.

Fourth,hiring DDT is an implicit admission by GFRE’s management that its current auditor,BDO Limited, lacks credibility among
investors. Consider the following. If GFRE hired DTT in order to reassure investors that it maintained adequate internal controls and
that it was not committing fraud,then why not hire DTT to audit the company? If DTT conducted an audit it would be under certain
legal and professional obligations to disclose any inadequacy in GFRE’s accounting practices and might be liable in the event GFRE is
committing fraud. Instead,GFRE hiredDTT to issue a one-off secret report,for whichDTT bears little,if any,legal or reputational risk.


Instead, GFRE stuck with BDO Limited as its primary auditor. This makes no sense. If BDO Limited is not sufficiently
credible to reassure investors that the company’s financials are accurate, as GFRE virtually conceded when it brought in DTT,
why should investors be confident in BDO Limited going forward? Ultimately, to take advantage of DTT’s credibility as a
“big four” auditor, GFRE should have asked DTT to stand behind the company’s publicly filed financials. It did not.


GFRE’s Business is Not as Advertised
Our investigators visited each GFRE factory and found that some of the factories were not in the locations described in the


company’s SEC filings. To boot, each factory was much smaller than GFRE claims in its SEC filings.


WHERE’SWALDO


Our investigators had trouble locating some of GFRE’s factories because they were not in the locations that GFRE claimed in
its public filings. GFRE’s Form 10-K states that Factory 3 is located in DongYing City, Liu HuVillage. This is incorrect. Our
investigator found Factory 3 in Shouguang City,YangkouTownship,DingjiaVillage. These two locations are almost 100 km apart.


Likewise for Factory 5. GFRE states that it is located in Shouguang City,HouxingVillage but our investigator found the fac-
tory over 20 km from its reported location in Shouguang City,YingliTownship,YangziVillage. Similarly,GFRE’s public filing states
that factory 6 is located in Shouguang City,Hanting District. We found Factory 6 inWeifang City,Hanting District.


The following map shows the discrepancies between the location of the factories according to GFRE (shown in red) and
the actual locations of the factories as confirmed by our investigative team (as shown in orange).


15


FACTORY LOCATIONS
GULF RESOURCES, INC.


GFRE is not only misrepresenting the location of certain factories, but the size of its operation. The following table com-
pares, for each factory, the acreage listed in GFRE’s SEC filings and the estimates of our investigators of the size of each factory.


Note that the “Actual LandArea” column is an estimate of the area of the factory that is walled off. As demonstrated by our
videos, each factory is surrounded by brine ponds, which we did not include in our “Actual Land Area” calculation. As such,
our estimate for “Actual LandArea” is likely underestimating the size of the respective factories. However,we believe that even
including the fields surrounding such factories, management is exaggerating the size of its factories in its public filings.


In order to corroborate these observations we called the Shouguang City State Land & Resources Bureau (“Land & Re-
sources Bureau”) for the locality in which GFRE operates. When asked, a Land & Resources Bureau representative stated that
the land area of Factory 7 was only 7.4 acres. This is much smaller than the 1,611 acres claimed by GFRE.


More importantly, the Land & Resources Bureau representative said that the total bromine production area registered under
GFRE’s operating subsidiary was 282 acres, which is 81 times smaller than the land area claimed by GFRE in its SEC filings
and much closer to the size of the production area observed by our investigators.


The Land & Resources Bureau representative also directly refuted GFRE’s claim that it could mine bromine without a per-
mit. In GFRE’s Form 10-K, the company admits that it does not hold a permit to produce bromine for Factories 5, 6, 7, 8
and 9, but claims that the company received a “letter from the Shouguang Municipal State Land and Resources Bureau on
March 10, 2011, stating that these five bromine factories ‘are permitted to continue with the mining and can operate in a stan-
dard manner and carry out mining activities in a reasonable way pursuant to the requirements of the relevant mineral resources
authorities, and are free of any illegal acts of exceeding layer or boundary limits and any violations of relevant laws and regu-
lations of the State.’”34


However, the Land & Resources Bureau representative said that the law strictly prohibited producing bromine without a per-
mit. When we asked if GFRE could be excused from this requirement if it received a letter from a government authority stat-
ing that it could operate while its permit application was pending, the Land & Resources Bureau representative said no. He
said that without a permit, law enforcement would shut down any unlicensed production of bromine.


China is a complex web of over-lapping municipal, provincial and national bureaucracies. It is entirely possible that one bu-
reaucracy could issue a permission slip contradicting the dictates of another silo of governmental authority. But our conversa-
tion with the Land & Resources Bureau representative illustrates that there is considerable risk associated with operating without
a bromine permit, and investors should not depend on revenue streams from GFRE’s Factories that are unlicensed.

GFRE’s Financials Are “Too Good To Be True”
One of the common denominators to many small cap Chinese frauds is that such companies’ boast financials that appear too


good to be true. GFRE is no different.


Promoters and investors salivate over high inventory turnover ratios as a proxy for robust growth, efficiency and profitabil-
ity. GFRE’s inventory turnover ratio suggests that GFRE is wildly efficient at turning a profit.


Finance 101 teaches that a higher inventory turnover rate often leads to higher growth and offers investors a healthy return
on their investment. GFRE’s inventory turnover ratio is spectacular. Incredibly so. According to GFRE’s financial statements,
on average, the company turns its inventory 206 times per year, at an average rate of once every two days. This is not credible.


Our research indicates that the industry average for inventory turnover is between 4-7x per year. Not coincidentally, the in-
ventory turnover ratios of GFRE’s subsidiaries are close to this industry average if we calculate the ratio using the financial data
from the company’s SAIC filings, as shown in the table below.


Using financial data from GFRE’s SAIC filings, the company’s inventory turnover ratios are within the realm of reason and
are comparable to other companies in the industry. This suggests that GFRE’s SAIC financials are much more reliable than
the financials it filed with the SEC.


To believe that GFRE’s SEC financials are accurate, an investor would have to conclude, based on GFRE’s inventory turnover
ratio, that GFRE has discovered a magic formula, which is unknown to much more sophisticated firms in the same industry,
and which allows GFRE to achieve seemingly unachievable results on a limited amount of capital. The much simpler, be-
lievable and likely explanation is that GFRE is fabricating its financial statements.

SAIC FILINGS


We obtained income statements and balance sheets for SCHC and SYCI from local filing offices of the SAIC showing that
GFRE’s business is considerably smaller than the company has represented to investors. The SAIC filings, summarized on a
chart on the next page, corroborate other evidence suggesting that the company’s revenues and net income are much smaller
than stated in GFRE’s SEC filings.


According to documents filed by GFRE in China, the company has been fabricating its SEC filed financial statements.


There has been much debate recently about the validity of SAIC filings. The SAIC is a government agency which,among other func-
tions, issues business licenses toChinese firms. In order to obtain and renew a business license,which is required to operate inChina,a Chi-
nese company must file an annual inspection report with a local government office containing a balance sheet and an income statement.


Brokers pumping small cap Chinese stocks often argue that SAIC filings do not match SEC filings because the SAIC is a
business registrar and it does not review the accuracy of submitted financial statements. This makes no sense. Why would a
government agency ask a company to submit a balance sheet or income statement and then not care if it is blatantly false? More
importantly, what would a company gain by lying on financial statements submitted to the SAIC?


Some small cap brokers have argued that Chinese companies understate revenue in SAIC filings so as to avoid the attention
of corrupt government officials. This argument is weak. Nothing should attract more attention from potentially corrupt gov-
ernment officials than raising tens of millions of dollars in cash throughAmerican capital markets. Regardless,why are investors
comfortable with a company that lies on any financial statement filed with any governmental agency, in the U.S. or China?

Western investors defending the discrepancy between financial statements filed with the SAIC and those filed with the SEC
should consider the following decision box:


Whereas for a Chinese company there is large upside and limited downside to lying to the SEC, there is by comparison no
upside and a potentially large downside to lying to the SAIC. So if there is a discrepancy between SEC and SAIC filings, it is
logically more likely that the SEC filings are false. Finally, empirical evidence shows that there are many examples of legiti-
mate companies that file accurate financial statements with the SAIC.

Shipping Costs - Suspiciously Low?
GFRE’s shipping costs are suspiciously low considering the company purportedly moves up to 34,672 metric tons of bromine


and 370,437 metric tons of crude salt per year. According to its public filings, the company classifies shipping and handling
costs as part of the cost of net revenue, which amounted to $567,686, $492,582 and $424,819 for the years ended December
31, 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively.35


The following table compares, year over year, the growth in GFRE’s bromine and crude salt production against the change
in shipping costs.


The table above presents very unusual numbers. GFRE’s production grew 312% from 2007 to 2008, yet shipping costs only
increased by 16% in the same period. How was the company able to spectacularly ramp up production yet pay only a mar-
ginal increase in the shipping cost? From 2009 to 2010,GFRE’s increased by almost the same amount (roughly 15%), yet the
company only shipped 3% more in metric tons.


GFRE claims to ship crude salt and bromine for a little over $1/ton for the last two years. This cost seems suspiciously low.


Bromine is a hazardous chemical which is highly corrosive and volatile. Bromine is so dangerous that both Israel and the
United States, the largest producers in the world, tightly regulate the transportation of the chemical.36 Recall that GFRE’s pro-
duction sites are located in remote, hard to reach areas of China. According to our investigators who made the journey, it was
difficult (and slow) to reach GFRE’s factories in a small vehicle. The roads in and around many of GFRE’s factories were un-
paved, muddy and riddled with pot holes. Trucks shipping large quantities of extremely hazardous chemicals must take even
longer. Put simply, the roads did not seem suited to handle hundreds of thousands of metric tons of bromine and crude salt.
And the condition of the roads made it seem especially unlikely that GFRE could ship its products for $1/ton.

Conclusion - Selling Ice to Eskimos
The cumulative evidence that GFRE is omitting material information from its SEC financial statements should give pause to anyone


owning GFRE’s shares.Given that the chairman and founder publicly advertises on a website that he effectively holds the business in a
privately held conglomerate, it is staggering that GFRE has thus far duped investors and escaped the attention of regulators.To review:


• A privately held Chinese company, owned by the founder and chairman of the board of GFRE, claims to own and
operate all of GFRE’s assets and business. This suggests that the chairman sold investors shares of a worthless shell en-
tity while keeping the underlying business under a separate privately held conglomerate. Given the difficulty of liti-
gating in China and the complex multi-jurisdictional corporate structure of GFRE, shareholders may have great
difficulty in recovering any value from the company.


• GFRE engaged in inappropriate self-dealing by massively overpaying for a business owned by its chairman and his family.


• GFRE has failed to disclose that its largest customer is a related party.


•We visited each of GFRE’s factories each appeared far smaller than GFRE reported in its SEC filings. A represen-
tative from a local government office confirmed that GFRE’s production area was substantially smaller than GFRE’s
claims in its public filings. Videos of GFRE’s factories can be seen here, here, here and here.


• GFRE’s CEO appears to have lied on his resume and has omitted the fact that he was formerly the CFO of China
Finance, Inc., a notorious purveyor of fraudulent Chinese microcap companies. Suspiciously, GFRE’s CEO was ap-
pointed a mere seven days after GFRE issued shares equal to 15% of its outstanding equity to China Finance, Inc. This
CEO then struck a deal that appeared to enrich China Finance, Inc. at the expense of GFRE’s shareholders, poten-
tially creating a “death spiral” for GFRE’s stock.


• GFRE commissioned two contractors to perform two expensive capital expenditure projects. Despite a thorough in-
vestigation, we have been unable to find any evidence that either contractor is a working business. We believe that man-
agement may have used these suspicious capital expenditure projects as a vehicle to transfer money out of the company.


• BDO Limited is GFRE’s 3rd auditor in 4 years. GFRE dismissed an auditor which had questioned the effectiveness of its
internal controls immediately before the release of GFRE’s FY 2009 Form 10-K and replaced it with BDO Limited,an au-
ditor that has represented other publicly listed Chinese companies which have committed or are accused of committing fraud.


•The only American director on GFRE’s board, who also served as a member of the audit committee, resigned after
DeloitteToucheTomatsu delivered a report to GFRE on its internal controls. He resigned a mere two weeks before
the company filed its Form 10-K for the FY 2010.


• SAIC Filings show that GFRE has submitted fraudulent financial statements to the SEC.


We therefore issue a strong sell rating on GFRE’s publicly traded securities and urge the last investor to turn out the lights.

panies providing misleading public disclosures and inaccurate financial statements.
