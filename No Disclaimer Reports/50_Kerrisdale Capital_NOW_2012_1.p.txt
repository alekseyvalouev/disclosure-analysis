ServiceNow, Inc. (NOW) 
 


 
We believe that ServiceNow, Inc. (“NOW” or the “Company”) is highly overvalued. The Company was 
taken public earlier this year at $18/share and has since ridden the cloud computing wave to a price of 
$30/share, implying an eye-popping 18.3x 2012E revenue multiple. Even if ServiceNow becomes the 
market leader and grows its share of the $1.5bn IT Help Desk market from the current 10%-15% to 30%, 
we believe the stock is still worth less than half of its current trading price.  
 
We have spoken to numerous industry professionals about ServiceNow and the IT Service Management 
(“ITSM”) sector, and our research indicates that ServiceNow does not have a sustainable competitive 
advantage over its numerous public and private peers. The Company has become a victim of its own 
success by helping to galvanize a previously dormant industry to rapid innovation. NOW does not offer a 
unique technology; rather, it merely introduced the SaaS business model to a sector where slow-moving 
incumbents had frustrated certain segments of their customer base through cumbersome upgrades and 
lumpy up-front costs. Its adoption of a SaaS solution, combined with an aggressive salesforce, helped 
NOW gain market share at the expense of larger players.  
 
Today, however, the competitive landscape is changing, with both incumbents and a slew of new 
upstarts featuring SaaS offerings similar to NOW’s products, and many at lower price points. The result 
has been predictable: NOW's once enviable growth is rapidly decelerating. The first signs of this became 
apparent when the company reported its third quarter earnings – NOW declined 12% after reporting 
slowing growth in the third quarter and projecting further decelerating growth in the upcoming quarter.  
 
We also believe that ServiceNow is burdened with many of the same problems as legacy systems. Like 
hosted software, ServiceNow’s fully-customizable, programmable code can lead to long implementation 
times, problems during software upgrade cycles, and increased total cost of ownership (“TCO”). These 
problems will only be exacerbated as NOW’s customer count continues to grow and its legacy customers 
begin to voice concerns. 
 
From a catalyst perspective, the market may view NOW’s Amended S-1 filing and the VCs' rush to 
unload their shares into the market as sufficient reason to reduce the stock's valuation multiple to a more 
reasonable level. Once the Amended S-1 offering doubles NOW’s public float and investors begin to 
scrutinize future lock-up expirations, institutional demand for shares could begin to wane, dragging down 
NOW’s share price.  
 
Given ServiceNow’s absurd $4.7 billion market capitalization, when compared to its projected 2012 
revenue of $239m, we think NOW’s share price is poised to collapse. The market is gradually digesting 
the company’s decelerating growth trends, and as NOW’s lockup expires, we believe the market will 
send the stock materially lower.

I.  Summary of Red Flags  
 
Below are key reasons why NOW’s share price should plummet:  
 
 NOW’s decelerating growth rates in Q3 and Q4E are only the beginning. NOW’s 


market shares gains have not been driven by technology, patents or enhanced R&D; 
rather, they are the function of ServiceNow offering a SaaS ITSM help desk solution for 
customers who were disenchanted with the incumbents’ on-premise offerings due to 
cumbersome upgrades, unpredictable costs, and a lack of customization flexibility. While 
that helped NOW gain initial momentum, the marketplace is meaningfully changing, with 
virtually all players introducing SaaS offerings. BMC is quickly expanding its RemedyForce 
segment and has introduced the user-friendly MyIT offering. HP has reworked its help desk 
product with the release of Service Anywhere, a SaaS-based ITSM upgrade designed for 
what it calls "codeless configuration". Smaller players like Cherwell Software, EasyVista, 
and Hornbill are offering competitive SaaS solutions that are winning business and gaining 
share. The increased competition should pressure NOW’s overall growth rate as well as 
reduce market pricing, rendering ServiceNow’s historical growth rates unsustainable. 
Finally, the low-hanging fruit in terms of customer wins is rapidly drying up. NOW's prior 
client wins have been fueled by frustrated customers who had no qualms about switching 
from on-premise to SaaS; future wins will have to come from customers who may not be as 
aggravated with BMC's or HP’s on-premise offerings or, for small- and mid-sized 
businesses, may prefer a simpler out-of-the-box solution from Cherwell, Hornbill, 
EasyVista, or other private competitors.  





 The overall ITSM market size is only $1.5 billion, less than one-third of NOW’s $4.7 
billion market capitalization. Leading technology research firm Gartner estimates that the 
IT Service Management market opportunity is $1.5 billion, and is growing at a modest 7% 
per year. Furthermore, Gartner's research predicts that only 50% of IT organizations will 
move to SaaS by 2015, implying that the total market opportunity for NOW's ITSM 
business is less than $1 billion. Given emerging competition from other SaaS ITSM service 
providers, we believe that the company will have a difficult time exceeding 30% market 
share. At $207m of LTM revenue, NOW appears to already control 10% to 15% of the 
market. So even if NOW’s market share rises to 30%, which we don’t see happening until 
2014 at the earliest, NOW's ITSM business should be generating less than $600 million 
revenue with limited additional growth opportunities. The result of the limited market size 
and increasing competition will be flattening growth over the next few years. 


 
 We see limited evidence that NOW is generating meaningful business outside of its 


core ITSM help desk offering. In order to inflate its addressable market size, NOW 
management claims to have created revenue opportunities beyond the IT Help Desk with 
its Discovery and Runbook Automation products. These modules contain additive 
functionality designed for the Configuration Management and Workload Automation 
software markets used by IT departments. But analysis from Gartner, Citigroup, and our 
research all indicate that ServiceNow’s simplistic products have yet to capture more than a 
negligible share of either market opportunity. ServiceNow has yet to even make it into 
Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation or its categorization of Configuration 
Management providers, which summarize the leading vendors in each discipline.

 ServiceNow’s PaaS is unproven and outmatched. NOW's PaaS offering faces daunting 
challenges. The product’s closed platform and lack of off-the-shelf third-party applications 
strikes us as too flawed to succeed against entrenched platforms from the likes of Google, 
Salesforce.com, and Microsoft. ServiceNow's PaaS uses a largely closed, "single-tenant" 
system that does not easily integrate with outside software applications, complicating its 
ability to integrate best-of-breed tools that come from outside the ServiceNow ecosystem. 
For these reasons, we don’t believe that PaaS can grow into the type of revenue driver that 
could justify NOW's lofty valuation. In fact, the closed nature of NOW's PaaS offering could 
be a long-term shortcoming of NOW’s Help Desk product versus more open solutions like 
Remedyforce, which integrates with the Force.com platform.   


 
 ServiceNow’s Help Desk product has many of the same flaws as its legacy 


competitors', including long implementation times, complexity during software 
upgrade cycles, and daunting upfront coding costs. After numerous calls with 
customers and Help Desk experts, we believe that NOW falls well short of fully addressing 
the industry’s pervasive problems. Should a customer require customized functionality, as 
many do, it can take 6-8 months1 and tens of thousands of dollars in implementation costs 
to get NOW’s system up and running. Furthermore, a ‘pure’ SaaS offering should have a 
multi-tenant design, meaning that the underlying code is shared by all users in the cloud. 
This makes regular software updates simpler and vastly reduces the time and costs 
required for upfront implementation. And if an enterprise-class customer needs a high 
degree of customization, then a non-SaaS, hosted system like BMC Remedy may be 
comparable. For these reasons, we think it’s a mistake to assume that the Company’s 
growth can remain head and shoulders above its rapidly evolving competition over the next 
1-2 years.  


 
 Given ServiceNow’s limited market size, competitive pressures within the SaaS ITSM 


sector, unproven PaaS product, and uninspiring technology when one looks past its 
more commodity ITSM offering, the math behind NOW’s valuation simply does not 
add up. ServiceNow reported 13% sequential revenue growth in Q3 and has projected 
about 10% sequential revenue growth in Q4. Even if it beats guidance in Q4, sequential 
quarter-over-quarter growth will likely decline below 10% in 2013 and probably below 5% 
by 2014, which implies annual revenue growth of 20% to 30%. The current 18x 2012E 
revenue is a preposterous multiple given the slowing growth and numerous business 
challenges NOW will face. 


 
 From a technical standpoint, the Company's looming lockup expiration on December 


26th, as well as its recent S-1 which allows certain insiders to sell shares before the 
lockup expiration, should exert downward pressure on shares. Only 11% of NOW's 
float is publicly traded (13.4m of its 123m unadjusted shares) but that should soon increase 
as lockups expire and as its highly dilutive option pool (37m; $4.48 strike) is exercised. 
ServiceNow’s non-trading shares were supposed to be locked-up until the day after 
Christmas, but according to a recently filed secondary S-1 (the “Amended S-1”), the 
Company has modified this lock-up and plans to sell 13.4m new shares at an earlier date. 
This will approximately double the public float. Should the underwriters exercise their 
greenshoe, as is typical, NOW will dilute its existing shareholders with 1.9m new shares. 
The remaining 11.5m shares (assuming the greenshoe is exercised) are being sold by 
NOW’s venture capital investors. NOW also has an enormously dilutive option pool 


                                                 
1 As indicated on the bottom of page 38 in NOW’s S-1.

consisting of 37m options struck at an average price of $4.48, creating a dilutive effect of 
32m shares at the current share price. Certain financial databases, industry press, and 
even Wall Street analysts completely overlook this option number in their valuation 
calculations. Finally, following an initial IPO price range of only $15-$17, NOW shares have 
since traded up to $30 on very little news (shares moved up 5% after a Q1 2012 revenue 
beat). We believe this run has been partly caused by NOW’s ‘thin float’ or ‘sliver sale’ initial 
public offering, a practice that even Jim Cramer eviscerates as reckless. ServiceNow sold 
13.4m of its 123m common shares in the June 2012 IPO. By creating a mismatch between 
supply and demand, these thin floats can artificially drive up demand for shares, thereby 
inflating share prices in the hopes that it remains at elevated levels through the lock-up 
period. 


 
In this report, we will address the above concerns in detail and their implications to value.  
 
 


II. Company Overview 
 
ServiceNow is a niche business software developer that markets IT Service Management 
products under a software-as-a-service (“SaaS”) subscription model. The Company’s lead 
product is an IT Help Desk program that has been the most heavily marketed SaaS product to 
emerge in a space largely dominated by hosted software. With any IT Help Desk software, 
instead of picking a phone to call the help desk, an employee can log into an online system to 
report an IT issue and receive rapid feedback. The IT manager on the other end receives the 
query, makes the required changes and solves the issue as part of his or her workflow queue. 
The Company calls this an “incident, problem, and change” process (Q2 Call). Our more than 
dozen calls with experts have indicated that the Help Desk software space is largely 
commoditized with a litany of vendors offering similar products. However, incumbents were 
initially slow to move to a SaaS model, which has several advantages over hosted software. 
This created an opportunity for the completely SaaS-based NOW. The advantages of SaaS 
include automated software updates, remote access through the cloud and off-premise 
database redundancies, amongst others. With that said, hosted software remains the most 
sensible choice versus SaaS for the many enterprise-scale businesses that require the greatest 
functionality and wish to maintain their software systems on more secure, in-house networks. In 
the case of ServiceNow, customization comes with a price since customers must retain 
JavaScript programmers on their staff or hire outside consultants to maintain the NOW code 
database. More recently introduced competitive SaaS offerings have migrated from complex 
coding requirements to out-of-the-box, multi-tenant SaaS solutions that offer simpler upfront 
implementation.  
 
For an overview of the ServiceNow software, we suggest that investors view the Company’s 
demo site and decide for themselves whether this really looks like a ~$4.5 billion piece of 
software. The screenshot below is the employee login dashboard from the Company’s demo 
site.

The leader in the IT service management software business is currently BMC Software, a 
profitable company with a 20+ year track record and a client base of over 50,000. While BMC’s 
Remedy software has historically been sold as hosted software under a license, BMC has 
aggressively invested in its SaaS solutions and now has about 475 SaaS customers.  In the 
third quarter, BMC added 90 SaaS customers, giving them 23% sequential quarter-on-quarter 
growth and demonstrating the customer buy-in of their SaaS solutions. This growth rate was 
almost twice that of ServiceNow’s customer growth (12%) over the same period. On their most 
recent earnings call, BMC discussed that when they bid for "a competitive deal with one of our 
biggest SaaS competitor[s]," likely a reference to ServiceNow, that "this last quarter we were at 
about a 60% win rate” (BMC Q2 F2013 Call).  
 
In order to gain market share in the extremely competitive IT Help Desk market, NOW has 
aggressively expanded its headcount and hired expensive sales staff. Compare NOW's R&D 
investments with its sales and marketing annual spend. In the last three fiscal years (year-end 
June 30th), ServiceNow reported $2.4m, $7.2m and $7.0m in research and development costs 
(the product was first created in 2005). Compare this to $8.5m, $19.3m and $34.1m of sales 
and marketing expense over the same periods. It's apparent that ServiceNow has become a 
sales company, not a high-tech R&D-intensive business with a deep technological advantage.  
 
Contrary to what glowing analyst reports might lead investors to believe, ServiceNow’s software 
is not beyond critique. The Company’s online service forum is full of complaints. Even the 
trusted research group Gartner states that ServiceNow’s “reporting, analytics, and dashboarding 
capabilities are average” and that “the vendor struggles to balance messaging of IT service 
management offerings versus platform-as-a-service capabilities.” As ServiceNow aggressively 
expands its headcount, it is also beginning to lose creative employees. In August 2012, Chris 
Dancy decided to quit ServiceNow to join BMC as a Director in the Office of the CTO. Mr. Dancy 
runs a heavily followed Twitter account (@ServiceSphere) and is widely considered to be at the 
forefront of social media in the IT Help Desk space. Mr. Dancy joined BMC after seeing 
Remedy’s MyIT product for the first time.

III. An Absurd Valuation at 20x Revenue 


Momentum shifts are not baked into ServiceNow’s current valuation, as the Company is 
effectively priced for perfection and the stock should waver at the slightest hiccup. Even with a 
hoard of well-capitalized competitors, very serious product risks and material growth hurdles, 
NOW trades at 21x LTM revenue. This multiple is higher than even Facebook at its IPO price. 
But more importantly, the Company is EBITDA negative yet trades at offensively high 2013E 
and 2014 EBITDA multiples of 196x and 74x, respectively. At the current price, we believe that 
investors are accepting inordinate amounts of risk for a mere 1.4% 2014 EBITDA yield (if NOW 
meets consensus estimates).

In the SaaS software sector, many analysts believe that billings is a better indicator of growth 
than revenue. Billings, as reported by NOW and others, more accurately reflects total upfront 
sales by including the deferred revenue of a subscription contract over its life. ServiceNow’s 
billings have slowed sharply from 23% sequential growth in the second quarter to 13% in the 
third. The Company has not given billings guidance for the fourth quarter, but has guided to 
revenue growth of ~10%. Even if NOW modestly beats their fourth quarter estimates, any 
growth in billings lower than 13% would indicate that NOW's revenue growth should soon drop 
below 10% sequentially, which is simply too low for a 20x+ LTM revenue multiple. 
 
The IT Help Desk sector is one of the most competitive sub-segments of the IT Service 
Management business. ServiceNow competes in a market still largely dominated by industry 
stalwarts like BMC, HP, Computer Associates, and IBM. These market giants offer bundled 
product offerings across all ITSM and ITOM product verticals, giving them a strong edge on 
smaller peers, including NOW, who have more limited product offerings. The market is also 
populated by smaller, private SaaS competitors such as Cherwell Software, EasyVista, and 
Hornbill. According to a report from Gartner, IT Help Desk has a market size of $1.5bn and is 
only growing at 7%, a figure that is hardly enough to justify NOW’s 21x LTM revenue multiple. 
Wall Street estimates predict that NOW can grow its market share from about 10% to 15% in 
2011 to 35% in 2014 to reach a revenue estimate of $530 million. Hitting these growth 
expectations will be extremely challenging since switching costs are high and Help Desk 
functionality is largely commoditized across competitive platforms.  
 
NOW must grow market share by about 7%/year to reach the Street’s 2013 revenue estimates. 
As a data point, Salesforce.com has only been able to increase its market share of the 
Customer Relationship Management software market by about 2-3% per year, according to data 
from Gartner:

Aside from IT Help Desk, analysts cite adjacent opportunities in areas such as Configuration 
Management, Workload Automation, and Asset Management to justify sky-high NOW price 
targets. Configuration Management ensures that the components of an IT ecosystem 
(user/software/network/server) are compatible with each other; Workload Automation assigns 
the order in which ‘jobs’ or batch processes run through the mainframe servers; and Asset 
Management is a financial tracking tool that itemizes all of an organization’s IT ‘assets’ (e.g. 
smartphones, laptops, servers, etc.). Our research indicates that ServiceNow’s existing suite of 
adjacent products (Discovery and Runbook Automation) are inferior compared to offerings from 
the large incumbents (IBM, BMC, and others) and that neither product presents significant near-
term revenue opportunities. Many of these adjacent software verticals are more technically 
complex than Help Desk and require a greater depth of product capabilities within a wider IT 
framework. For that reason, certain vendors can distinguish themselves by providing a full suite 
of integrated software tools. This gives an advantage to software titans like BMC, HP, IBM, 
Microsoft, and Computer Associates who have all established much larger beachheads 
throughout the IT suite.

sector from Citigroup:

Platform-as-a-Service 
 
NOW's promoters argue that NOW can distinguish itself from other SaaS competitors through 
its single-code platform architecture. ServiceNow’s CEO views the platform as a “Trojan horse” 
(Q3 2012 Call) that is initially adopted for its IT Help Desk application and then entices

customers to purchase other NOW applications or utilize NOW’s professional services to add 
new functionality. We believe that this closed architecture could turn out to be a fatal flaw as it 
complicates the addition of third-party applications. Indeed, we believe that customers who want 
to develop customized applications via a PaaS offering would prefer more widely-used platforms 
like Force.com and Google App Engine. Below is a summary of certain PaaS solutions currently 
in market. We believe that NOW's platform is heavily outmatched.  
 





Thin Float IPO Artificially Increased Share Demand 
 
Underwriters of NOW's IPO initially anticipated an opening price range of $15- $17 and the 
bookrunners ended up pricing the IPO at $18. NOW shares then traded up to $25 by the end of 
a frenzied trading day, giving IPO investors an enviable 40% one-day return. 
 
We suspect that the IPO was helped by its “thin float” nature.  In the IPO, ServiceNow only sold 
13.4 million of its 123 million common shares, representing 10% of the float. This figure is even 
smaller if one includes the 37 million stock options with a weighted average strike price of $4.48. 
Taking into account these highly dilutive options and 1 million restricted stock units, the fully 
diluted share count jumps to 158 million. We believe that NOW’s thin float may have contributed 
to the stock’s inflated share price run.  
 
Both Facebook and Zynga utilized similar thin float IPOs and investors have only recently 
woken up to the risk inherent in these stocks during their pre lock-up periods. In gifting 
institutional clients with one-day IPO stock pops, underwriters have scattered landmines all over 
the technology sector.  
 


Much of the Press, Analysts, and Financial Databases Overlook NOW’s Highly 
Dilutive Option Pool 
 
One of the most appalling valuation mistakes that we’ve noticed with NOW is the exclusion of 
the 37 million share pool ($4.48 strike price) of highly dilutive options from market capitalization 
calculations. Some Wall Street analysts, as well as reputable press sources, have excluded this 
option pool from their calculations of market capitalization, thereby underestimating revenue 
multiples, amongst other valuation metrics. To us, this seems like an embarrassing mistake. By 
excluding the dilutive effect of options, investors would be overstating their valuation metrics by 
an incredible 27%.

IV  NOW Faces Competitive and Structural Headwinds 


SaaS Help Desk Competition Has Intensified 
 
The Market Leader: BMC Software 
There's little doubt that BMC was too slow to embrace SaaS for the ITSM sector, and its 
complacency allowed NOW to enter the market and steal market share. That said, BMC's 
technological depth in the broader ITOM space is extensive, and we believe it has taken steps 
to stop the bleeding. The company now offers a rapidly growing SaaS solution as well as an

OnDemand version of its market leading Remedy software.  The pure SaaS product, 
RemedyForce, operates within the Force.com cloud platform, making it convenient for 
customers who already use productivity applications on Force.com. BMC has grown its SaaS 
customer base from ~315 in Q1 to ~475 in Q3 2012, implying about 20% sequential quarterly 
growth. This customer growth figure is about twice that of NOW. According to BMC’s CEO, 
“RemedyForce is an area we're really going to be putting some more dollars into and more 
focus on” (BMC FQ2 2013 Earnings Call). For larger enterprise customers who require greater 
customization, Remedy OnDemand is BMC’s flagship product offered over the cloud. It gives 
customers a choice between a secure, fully-customizable hosted system and a simpler, 
configurable SaaS.  
 
On Tuesday, October 30th, BMC launched MyIT, the newest addition to its Remedy suite of 
products. MyIT is a social and self-service tool that integrates with Remedy to increase 
productivity. Amongst other features, MyIT allows users to self-diagnose IT problems, make the 
corresponding requests, and personalize their IT Help Desk application with their favorite tools. 
MyIT also integrates seamlessly with mobile hardware, such as phones or tablets, allowing the 
end-user to do things like request a conference room, access an application, or request a 
webinar remotely. MyIT has received favorable reviews by Stephen Mann from Forrester 
Research. Mr. Mann stated that, “[MyIT is] a great move by BMC that pushes the proverbial 
envelope for ITSM tools.” Chris Dancy, the widely-followed ITSM executive who decided to quit 
ServiceNow to join BMC, says that MyIT was “the real reason I joined BMC.” Mr. Dancy is the 
#2 most-followed thought leader in the ITSM industry on Twitter (Mr. Mann is #1).  
 


BMC’s MyIT

Finally, one of BMC’s biggest advantages versus NOW remains its deep suite of ITSM products. 
Many enterprise customers prefer a single vendor that offers solutions across the IT service and 
operations management landscapes. ServiceNow may have a strong IT Help Desk product, but 
it's still technologically immature in Configuration Management, Workload Automation and its 
other ancillary product verticals. This gives horizontally integrated companies such as BMC, HP 
and IBM a significant advantage over upstarts like ServiceNow.

The Three Incumbents: HP, CA, IBM 
BMC isn’t the only incumbent making efforts to protect its existing customer base with new 
SaaS offerings. Last week, HP announced the release of HP Service Anywhere, which provides 
many of the same capabilities as HP’s traditional ITSM offerings, but under a SaaS framework. 
HP has designed this product for “codeless configuration,” which would allow users to add 
functionality without having to know a programming language. This could potentially give HP's 
product an edge over NOW for customers who want to lower their implementation and coding 
costs. HP Service Anywhere also introduced a significant social media component to its Help 
Desk suite. Service Anywhere should make it more difficult for NOW to poach existing HP users 
like it did in the past. 
 
Computer Associates has also reacted to the ServiceNow threat with its CA Nimsoft Service 
Desk, a multi-tenant SaaS solution that allows configuration while limiting in-suite coding. 
Should a large enterprise customer require complex functionality, CA still offers its software in a 
customizable, hosted instance. This multi-tiered product approach, as used by BMC and HP, 
allows customers to choose between a more secure hosted offering or a SaaS-based approach. 
 
IBM remains a common brand of choice for large, complex enterprises that require a full suite of 
IT functionality. IBM integrates IT Help Desk, Configuration Management, Asset Management 
and Workload Automation through a single interface under its SmartCloud network. The 
SmartCloud is available for a single price and easily integrates with 10 incremental “ITIL” 
(Information Technology Infrastructure Library) products, such as IBM Rational and IBM Tivoli. 
IBM holds a leading 20-30% market share in many of these more complex computing areas 
such as Network Management and Application Development. ServiceNow does not have 
functionality in either segment, giving it a material disadvantage for complex Fortune 500 
clients.

Emerging Competitors: Private ITSM Companies 
Moving beyond the large incumbents, several other private companies have recently emerged 
as competitors to ServiceNow. Each of these companies has a core SaaS Help Desk product 
supported by a few adjacent tools, putting their product depth in-line with ServiceNow. Cherwell 
Software, founded by former executives of FrontRange, is a strong SaaS competitor that is 
frequently overlooked by Street analysts but often cited by industry experts. Unlike ServiceNow, 
Cherwell offers an all-inclusive, concurrent license rather than a piecemeal offering. This is a

major selling point for some customers, who feel cheated when ServiceNow attempts to upsell 
them additional modules such as Discovery and Runbook Automation. Cherwell also owns its 
own data centers whereas NOW is still in the process of transitioning to wholly-owned centers. 
Cherwell has done well internationally; half of its sales are outside the United States. Cherwell 
can also engineer its product as a PaaS, potentially pitting it head-to-head with NOW at nearly 
every sales pitch. 
 
There are other competitors that could emerge to chip away at NOW's edge as the leading 
SAAS provider of ITSM. One company we’ve heard great things about from independent 
experts is the Europe-based EasyVista. EasyVista is the successor to Staff & Line, which was 
founded in 1988 and has a deep heritage in the ITSM space. EasyVista has created a well-
designed, highly functional product that some believe shows innovation much like ServiceNow 
did 5 years ago. EasyVista features a codeless SaaS architecture that makes it relatively simple 
to configure. According to the company’s website, non-technical IT users can be trained to 
configure the product in under a day. EasyVista 2012 has been updated for full integration 
between the help desk solution and configuration/asset management, workflow automation, and 
other ancillary product capabilities. While EasyVista is still expanding its sales presence in the 
U.S., our research indicates that it is increasingly showing up in the final rounds of RFP 
meetings and could be primed to disrupt NOW’s growth trajectory. EasyVista currently boasts a 
customer roster with the likes of L’Oreal, Mercedes Benz, HSBC, and Quicksilver. 
 
Hornbill is a third name that repeatedly came up during our discussions with industry 
professionals. Like BMC, Hornbill provides both hosted and SaaS ITSM software, providing 
customers a choice between on-premise and SaaS. Going further with its customer-centric 
approach, Hornbill’s SaaS product is priced in three separate tiers (standard, pro, and expert). 
The ‘standard’ solution allows those who prefer fast implementation periods over complex 
customization to get their ITSM processes up and running as soon as possible.  
 
ServiceNow also faces opposition from the likes of Axios, LANDesk, SAManage, FrontRange, 
Serena Software, SunView Software, and dozens of other ITSM companies. Accordingly, we do 
not believe that ServiceNow has anything close to a monopoly in the SaaS market, as many 
believe, but instead competes with numerous offerings. 
 
We would also expect that investment bankers are currently banging down the doors of the 
fastest-growing private ITSM companies given NOW’s valuation.  New IPO funding could help 
companies like Cherwell become even more viable alternatives to NOW, especially among 
enterprise customers. This would slow down NOW's market share growth as well as pressure 
them on pricing.  
 


ServiceNow’s Ancillary Offerings Provide Very Little Revenue 
 
NOW markets two ancillary products that it attempts to upsell alongside its IT Help Desk 
software. While Wall Street believes that these secondary products can quickly gain market 
share over entrenched competitors, these products continue to make limited headway even 
after several years in existence. Discovery, the Configuration Management tool that helps map 
server loads and computing operations, was launched in late 2007 yet still only has 0.2% 
market share, according to a Citigroup July 24th report. We also believe that this very low market 
share is not necessarily due to a lack of customers to cross-sell to, but rather because of the 
software's lack of functionality.

A report on the Configuration Management market last year from Gartner doesn’t even list 
ServiceNow as a player in this market. We believe that the chart below is particularly relevant 
since the $4bn Configuration Management market size figure was put together by Gartner itself, 
and they would therefore be best placed to define the competitors for that revenue pie.

ServiceNow is nowhere to be found in the above diagram.  
 
ServiceNow’s other tool, aside from Help Desk, is Runbook Automation, a tool that addresses 
part of the complex Workload Automation market (coordination of batch submissions and other 
computing-intensive data processes). Runbook Automation also has a meager 0.2% market 
share (Gartner/Citigroup figures) even though Runbook was launched in late 2010. Frank 
Slootman, NOW’s CEO, commented that for Runbook Automation, “the penetration is less than 
10%” (NOW Q2 2012 Earnings Call) of their existing customer base. Slootman went on to say 
on the Q3 2012 earnings call, that “in terms of the model, our principle source of upsell revenue 
comes from incremental users, right, as opposed to incremental applications.” 
 
Below is the Gartner Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation. Gartner lists twelve competitors. 
ServiceNow is nowhere to be found. The world's leading technology research firm does not 
consider ServiceNow to be a meaningful vendor in Workload Automation.

Gartner’s Magic Quadrant for Workload Automation

Much like Help Desk, these adjacent fields are highly competitive and heavily populated by 
large enterprises as well as well-funded private companies. Data from Gartner supports our 
skeptical analysis of the revenue opportunity for Discovery and Runbook Automation.  
 


NOW’s Platform-as-a-Service Offering Has Several Fatal Flaws 
 
Broadly speaking, platform-as-a-service (PaaS) products allow customers to integrate 
numerous disparate software products (including SaaS) under a single dashboard. This 
dashboard then manages each piece of software as an individual application. One can think of a 
PaaS dashboard as being akin to the home screen on an iPhone. Much like the App Store, the 
more applications that one adds into an ecosystem, the more valuable the platform becomes. 
Market leaders such as Force.com have 220,000 different applications made by leading 
software vendors like Oracle, SAP, Microsoft, Facebook and other developers who’ve become 
comfortable with the Force.com system.

As shown in the PaaS overview chart above, Force.com, Microsoft Azure and LongJump are all 
examples of open platforms. ServiceNow, on the other hand, uses a largely closed, single-
tenant system that does not easily integrate with outside software applications. While this might 
allow additional customization in some instances, it limits the ability to integrate best-of-breed 
tools that come from outside the ServiceNow ecosystem.  
 
Frank Slootman, ServiceNow’s CEO, has essentially conceded that NOW does not compete 
head-to-head with more widely used platforms: 
 


“The platform market itself is very difficult. I am not looking for out-and-out confrontations with other 
platform vendors when I can roll the platform in the door right behind our ITSM application 
portfolio. That is our strategy and that's the one that's working for us, and that's the one that we're 
going to continue to follow.”  ̶  NOW Q3 Earnings Call 


 
We're skeptical that NOW's Platform-as-a-Service strategy will succeed. Competition in PaaS is 
fierce. It’s one thing to disrupt dithering incumbents like BMC and HP in the ITSM sector; it’s 
another to compete head-to-head with visionary, aggressive and well-funded companies like 
Salesforce.com and Amazon. 
 


Single-Tenant vs. Multi-Tenant 
 
The differences between single and multi-tenant SaaS are subtle but matter when forecasting 
the future direction of the industry. Single-tenant SaaS generally refers to fully-customizable 
software that can vary by customer (including a separate database instance for each 
application); ServiceNow’s customizable code firmly places them in this category. Some of the 
independent experts that we’ve spoken with believe that a multi-tenant architecture, or one in 
which the underlying software is identical across customers, is a better way forward for the 
SaaS industry. Without variation in the underlying code, multi-tenant SaaS makes regular 
software updates much simpler for all end users. This issue is significant since many of NOW's 
customer wins have come from clients who have been frustrated with the incumbents' 
cumbersome upgrades, and are looking for predictable, straightforward software updates. Yet a 
single-tenant system would typically involve complex upgrades given that different clients have 
customized their NOW platforms with functionality specific to their operations. Additionally, 
single tenancy usually involves substantial upfront coding costs and longer implementation 
times. For these reasons, NOW may lose certain customers over time to SaaS providers who 
offer more attractive multi-tenant solutions.

NOW Loses Money Upfront on Installations  
 
Because they use a customizable code architecture, NOW’s Help Desk product requires more 
upfront technical training and implementation services than a simpler multi-tenant solution. This 
adds engineering costs that must be borne by either NOW or its customers. These costs are 
reflected in NOW’s Professional Services segment, which has lost $4.2m over the last twelve 
months.

Historically, ServiceNow has implemented coding changes through third-party consultants. The 
Company was able to undercharge for these services since the partners were reliant on the 
customer flow from NOW. But ServiceNow has recently moved to bring these implementation 
services in-house. According to NOW’s 10-Q, they also adjusted the pricing model for 
Professional Services from a fixed-fee to a time-and-materials arrangement. Our conversations 
with independent experts confirm our belief that this could drive up the life-cycle costs of NOW’s 
IT Help Desk product and make it less price competitive versus its peers. While this might finally

NOW’s Insiders Have Filed to Begin Selling Shares Ahead of Lock-up Expiration 
 
According to ServiceNow’s IPO prospectus, the vast majority of its shareholders were subject to 
a 180-day lock-up. As a group, these holders represent 106.2 million common shares, or 
roughly 87% of the outstanding common stock. The remaining 2.5m shares are subject to a 
lock-up until February 21, 2013. But after market close on November 9th, as investors were 
leaving their desks for the weekend, ServiceNow reneged on their previous lock-up schedule 
and filed an amended S-1 agreement to push forward share sales by insiders in a newly dilutive 
offering by the Company. Insider VC investors (primarily JMI Equity in this offering) will sell 
11.5m shares (including a pro rata share of the greenshoe). 
 
The offering is also issuing 1.9m new shares (including pro-rata share of the greenshoe), which 
will further dilute existing shareholders in order to raise about $55m for the Company. Given that 
NOW had $256.5 million of cash and equivalents and its cash flow from operations less capital 
expenditures has never been less than -$15 million in any rolling twelve-month period over the 
past three years, the company clearly does not need additional cash. Rather, we view the $55 
million capital raise as a sign that management itself views its stock as overvalued, and wants to 
raise capital before the share price declines to a less attractive level. The new issuance should 
increase the share count to 125m common and 158m on a fully diluted basis.   
 
The combination of the insider sales and the 1.9m of new issuance will effectively double the 
size of the 13.4m public float. We believe the supply of new shares could place downward 
pressure on NOW’s share price. The amended lock-up structure allows for the sale of an 
additional i) 5m shares on December 26th, 2012; ii) 42.7m shares on the second trading day 
after Q4 results are announced (~late January/early February); iii) 49.8m shares on the 91st day 
following the Amended S-1 offering and; iv) 2.45m shares on February 21st, 2013. 
 
At NOW’s current price, NOW’s VC owners may be eager to return cash to their limited 
partners, particularly since they invested in ServiceNow at far lower levels. According to data 
from NOW’s S-1 and public press releases, JMI has invested $16.5m through four separate 
offerings to accumulate its current 59.8m shareholding, indicating a $0.28 buy-in price. This 
means that JMI’s investment is currently sitting on a 105x cash-on-cash return at NOW’s $30 
trading price. Sequoia joined the fray in November 2009 by sweeping up 23.9m shares for only 
$51.6m, giving them a buy-in price of $2.16. Greylock, which invested in February 2012, only 4 
months before the IPO date, bought 2.5m shares at a $10.20 price per share. With buy-in 
prices as low as these, the VCs may be counting down the days to the lock-up expiration date. 
 
The Effect of Lock-Up Expirations 
Facebook’s (“FB”) share price history is instructive in illustrating the risks of sudden lock-up 
expirations. As most investors know, Facebook’s IPO was highly anticipated and closely

followed. Even after its opening day stumble, FB shares initially traded at a 20x trailing revenue 
multiple. But as time went on and the IPO hangover settled in, investors become wary as FB’s 
share lock-ups approached expiration.

As these concerns settled in, Facebook’s trailing revenue multiple collapsed from 20x to 8x. The

We readily acknowledge that many other factors were in play during these periods. But just a 
cursory look at the share price chart next to the share lock-up dates suggests more than a 
casual association.  
 
 
One Comparable, BMC Software, trades at 2.4x 2014E revenue 
 
ServiceNow’s 10%+ sequential quarterly growth is simply unsustainable given the limited size of 
the Help Desk market, the high switching costs between product offerings, and the introduction 
of SaaS products by NOW’s larger competitors. Therefore, we’d argue that NOW should revert 
to a multiple comparable to BMC Software as NOW’s growth continues to slow. Using this logic, 
if one assigns a 3x-4x 2014E revenue multiple range, a generous premium to BMC even though 
NOW currently burns cash, the 2014 revenue estimates of $530m would equate to a share price 
range of $12-$15. Even at the high end, this represents a more than 50% discount to the current 
trading price. This price range assumes that NOW continues to execute perfectly and can reach 
the analyst expectation of $530m and grow its share of the $1.5bn IT Help Desk market from 
about 15% to 35% over two years.

V. Conclusion 
 
We congratulate ServiceNow for creating a niche IT service management product with only 
$40m of R&D during the four-year period between June 2008 and June 2012. We also 
commend JMI Equity for their 105x return and Sequoia on their 1300% return, at least on paper. 
But recent moves by BMC, HP, and others to defend their turf in the SaaS space will make it 
much more difficult for NOW to win customers at its current rate, expediting the Company’s 
growth deceleration. Several recently introduced products prove that in a rapidly changing and 
highly competitive industry, ServiceNow does not have a technological moat, nor should it be 
assumed that the Company can continue to grow market share indefinitely. Somehow NOW has 
achieved a $4.7bn market capitalization, which is roughly the entire IT Help Desk ($1.4bn) and 
Configuration Management ($4bn) sectors combined. Since NOW only has about 15% share in 
the former and minimal penetration into the latter, we believe that investors have relied on pie-
in-the-sky investor presentations instead of grounded financial analysis.  
 
We also do not believe that ServiceNow’s Help Desk product is as groundbreaking as many 
believe. The Company’s single-tenant SaaS model is susceptible to many of the same problems 
that have plagued hosted software, namely extended upfront implementation periods, ongoing 
professional services fees to maintain the code database, and high total costs of ownership over 
the cycle. While Fortune 500 customers may expect to incur these problems to achieve their 
desired level of customization, we believe that customers further down-market are becoming 
more sensitive to these issues. Some of the more nimble multi-tenant SaaS can actually offer 
long-term cost savings and rapid implementation cycles thanks to a simplified software platform. 
As ServiceNow begins to expand its customer base beyond the low-hanging fruit (i.e. 
dissatisfied customers seeking an alternative to hosted), these issues should increasingly come 
to light.

These substantial growth headwinds combined with the Company’s untenable valuation should 
increasingly come into focus as NOW’s venture capital investors seek to unload their shares 
onto the public markets. In our opinion, the November 9th Amended S-1 is a clear showing of 
bad faith by the initial VC investors as its pushes forward share sales that were intended to be 
locked-up until December 26th, 2012 (according to the original prospectus). The Amended S-1 
contemplates the sale of 11.5m by insiders and the issuance of 1.9m new shares by NOW itself, 
assuming that the full greenshoe is exercised, the combination of which will double the 
Company’s 13.4m float. With 158m diluted shares outstanding, this offering only scratches the 
surface of the secondary sales that will soon come to market. Should NOW’s growth continue to 
retreat to more sustainable levels, as is every indication, we believe that this selling pressure 
will only exacerbate the sharp fall that we expect in NOW’s share price.
