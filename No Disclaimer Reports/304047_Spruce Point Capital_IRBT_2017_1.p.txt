Executive Summary
4


Spruce Point Has Re-Initiated A Short Position 
in iRobot (IRBT) and Sees 20%-50% Downside


In May 2014, Spruce Point made its first short recommendation of iRobot, noting fundamental struggles, signs of 


channel stuffing, bad governance practices, and failures to penetrate the Chinese market. For the following 2 years, 


iRobot’s share price languished and significantly underperformed the Nasdaq technology index. 


A majority of our criticisms and forecasts proved accurate.


Investors are overlooking disruptive competition likely to enter iRobot’s US market. Based on Spruce Point field 


research, we expect SharkNinja to launch a competing product at lower price points. SharkNinja outsold Dyson to claim 


market share in traditional vacuums. We believe they will partner with Ecovacs, the leader in the Chinese/Asia market 


which stole significant market share from iRobot. SharkNinja has a proven track record of disrupting numerous home 


appliance markets with dynamic market strategies, and superior products. With 88% US market share, iRobot’s share 


can only go down from here


iRobot’s recent financial performance reflects restocking of its supply chain after years of false starts, the removal of the


struggling military business, and the acquisition boost from its Japanese distributor. We believe these factors will create 


very difficult comparisons for iRobot to lap in the future, and create headwinds for future share price appreciation. 


Furthermore, we believe recent gains are a result of lowering the price of its Roomba to move down market, which we 


believe is a long-term negative on margins for a technology hardware company with a narrow product focus


Investors are overlooking financial control issues tied to iRobot’s recent acquisition of its Japanese distributor. The 


Company suspiciously retracted certain statements made about Japanese sales growth (reversing big gains to declines), 


and made revenue and earnings revisions which don’t add up. Spruce Point has previously pointed out early warning 


signs at Sabre and Caesarstone, both which made related-party distributor acquisitions ahead of extreme financial 


revisions. Market observers will note that Valeant’s attempt to buy Philidor was another canary in the coal mine


iRobot is trading at a peak valuation and 30% above its average analyst price target of $77. Many of its long-term 


fundamental investors have been selling, while retail and index funds buy. Insiders also have been heavy sellers before 


its recent share price increase. Its valuation dwarfs best of breed technology consumer companies such as Apple. If 


iRobot were to trade closer to peers and its long-term valuation at  3x - 4x book value and 1.5x – 2.5x sales, we could 


see 20% – 50% downside risk


With iRobot’s share price up 300% since 2016, investors are cheering the re-acceleration of sales and earnings growth 


following years of disappointment, and ascribing a peak valuation to plateauing earnings. Spruce Point believes the 


financial improvement reflects temporary factors and may not be sustainable. We expect new competition to storm the 


market, and challenge iRobot’s US market share dominance.

Timeline of Recent iRobot Events


Since the time of our report, the following developments have occurred:


• 2014-2015: iRobot misses revenue and earnings expectations multiple times after our report’s warning 


• April 2015: iRobot attracts the attention of another activist investment firm who wagers a proxy fight, criticizing the 


Company’s poor capital allocation and governance


• Feb 2016: Under pressure, iRobot sells its struggling defense and security business and has received just $23m in 


cash; the Company expands its share repurchase program by $100m


• March 2016: Repurchases $85m of its $100m through an accelerated share repurchase


• Oct 2016: Raises guidance for second time, backs view of 15% consumer revenue growth


• Nov 2016: Pursues inorganic growth by acquiring its Japanese distributor Sales on Demand Corp for ~$18m 


• Feb 2017: Offers 2017 guidance of 17-19% revenue growth, but EPS to a wide range of -9% to +11%; restates 


earnings transcript to correct gross mischaracterization of Japanese performance +20% to -17%


• April 2017: Raises top end of 2017 revenue and EPS range by just $5m and 0.05c, respectively. Revises Japanese 


distributor contribution. After years of promoting the value of its intellectual property, iRobot finally filed ITC Patent 


infringement complaint against robotic vacuum cleaner products sold by Bissell, Hoover and Black and Decker 


covering 6 patents


In May 2014, Spruce Point made its first short recommendation in iRobot, noting fundamental struggles, signs of 


channel stuffing, bad governance practices, and failures to penetrate the Chinese market. For the following 2 years, 


iRobot’s share price languished and significantly underperformed the Nasdaq technology index

Many of Spruce Point’s IRBT Criticisms 
In 2014 Have Proven Accurate


Our Criticisms in 2014 How It Played Out Accuracy


Financials appeared strained, marked by rising DSOs, and 
riddled with accounting gimmicks such as warranty reversals. 
Evidence suggests channel stuffing


IRBT’s stock price languished for 2yrs after our report + 
underperformed the Nasdaq. IRBT failed to meet analyst estimates 
multiple times during this period. Now strains are reappearing


Vacuum robots becoming commoditized, pricing pressures 
would persist from competitors entering at lower price points


Evidence now that IRBT has been lowering prices and putting more 
emphasis on the Roomba 650 to compete in the $200-$399 
segment, while now cutting prices on its newer 900 series


IRBT’s promotion of monetization strategies for its intellectual 
property portfolio would result in nothing


IRBT has still found no monetization strategies, and is resorting to 
patent defense to ward off competition


Misallocation of R&D capital towards health telepresence and 
robotic lawn mowers would fail to realize value


These products have failed, and are not currently being promoted 
by the Company. IRBT is still dependent on the Roomba


Speculation of IRBT as a takeover target was misplaced, and 
there would be no unsolicited buyers


No buyers emerged for IRBT’s entire business, absent the sale of 
the struggling military business which fetched a measly $23m 


IRBT’s China promotion as a “big opportunity” bound to fail 
due to flawed market strategy, too much competition


IRBT is still changing its China strategy and it has lost significant 
market share in Asia Pacific by its own admission


Poor governance marked by constant insider selling and 
milking of compensation


Our criticisms caught the attention of another activist who waged a 
proxy fight. IRBT insiders are still sellers of stock (while IRBT buys) 
and milking 20% of operating income in compensation


Promotion of IRBT stock geared toward retail investors 
Recent evidence that long-term institutional owners with a deep 
fundamental orientation are exiting their positions, while retail 
investors and index funds buy


Dyson entry into the market a significant threat to IRBT
Dyson’s entry failed to gain traction. The general consensus was 
that its price point of >$1,000 per unit was too high, and it did not 
deliver any meaningful value advantage vs. Roomba
SharkNinja/Ecovacs: 
Roomba’s New Competitive Threat

Who is SharkNinja and Why We Believe 
They Pose A Serious Threat To iRobot


SharkNinja, headquarted in Newton MA fifteen miles from iRobot, is an innovative consumer home appliance 


company that has disrupted markets it enters with high performance products, at affordable price points. 


SharkNinja is a leader in vacuums and blenders, and targets consumers through infomercials. Based on our 


research, we believe they will enter the robotic vacuum market and challenge iRobot


From an article by Forbes entitled “How Shark Ate Dyson’s Lunch In America” – Dec 2014


• Formerly known as Euro-Pro, a 100-year old company that had a mere 1% of vacuum cleaner sales in 2008, 


SharkNinja now controls more than 20% of the US market


• Over the past seven years, its Shark vacuum cleaners and Ninja blenders and food processors, all 


manufactured in China, have increased sales at a compound annual growth rate of 25%, enabling the firm to 


triple its workforce from 250 to 800 employees


• This growth has been aided by an aggressive push on television shopping channels, with $130m spent on TV 


advertising last year (examples: 1, 2, 3)


• The Company has doubled revenues from $800 million to more than $1.6 billion and usurped Dyson as leader 


of the US vacuum cleaner market since bringing in consultants Gap International two years ago


Channel checks show Shark Ninja already has key distribution partners: Home Depot, Bed Bath and 


Beyond, Target, Wal-Mart, Costco, Best Buy and Many More


• These key distribution outlets overlap with many of iRobot’s existing distribution partners


• In addition, SharkNinja is known for its extensive infomercials and television advertising. The Forbes article 


says it spent $130m on TV advertising, whereas iRobot spent just $64.4m on advertising in 2016 (not all TV)


Shark Ninja Recently Hired Goldman Sachs To Evaluate A Sale According To Reuters (April 2017)


• Sources suggest that private equity firms have expressed the most interest in SharkNinja


• Given that PE firms are financially motivated to grow their investments to achieve 15%+ p.a. returns, a financial 


buyer would be incentivized to grow SharkNinja through product and market expansion

Our Field Research on SharkNinja’s 
Robotic Vacuum Ambitions


Our research suggests that SharkNinja is likely to enter the home robotic vacuum market as early as this fall 


with a product in the $299 - $399 and pose a direct challenge to iRobot’s core 650 Roomba at mass merchants


• We believe SharkNinja strives to be the #1 or #2 leader in markets it enters. Based on its track record in 


traditional vacuums and blenders, we believe SharkNinja is a credible threat to iRobot


• SharkNinja’s displacement of Dyson in vacuums was a result of a laser-like focus on the consumer, and its 


ability to engineer a superior product at a value price point.  As an organization, Linkedin data shows that 


SharkNinja employs more engineers than sales or marketing people


• We believe Dyson failed to gain traction with its robotic vacuum because its price point of >$1,000 was simply 


too high, and it did not deliver meaningful performance advantage to the customer. Simply stated, Dyson 


could not offer a compelling value proposition


• We believe SharkNinja will use a similar strategy it used to displace Dyson with its go to market with iRobot –


deliver a high performing product at a lower price point, in this case in the $299 - $399 price range


• Given SharkNinja’s marketing prowess stated to be $130m annually (2014 figures), we wouldn’t be surprised 


to see it spend at least 10% or more to broaden product awareness


• SharkNinja has many existing relationships with retailers such as Target, Walmart and Bed Bath & Beyond. 


We would not be surprised if they leverage these relations to distribute their robotic vacuum in addition to 


infomercial marketing


• Our research suggests that SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs, the leading Chinese robotics maker and 


company that has gained significant share against iRobot in China

SharkNinja Commands Significant Shelf 
Space At Leading Retailers


It’s easy to see why retailers would want SharkNinja to enter the vacuum robotics market. Its current 


vacuums and blenders command significant shelf space and are very popular with customers.

SharkNinja’s First Robotic Vacuum Patent 
Just Filed, Material To iRobot’s Future


SharkNinja’s filing of a robotic vacuum patent in April 2017 has gone unnoticed by sell-side analysts and 


investors, but Spruce Point believes it is a significant indicator of SharkNinja’s ambition to leverage its 


success in traditional vacuums to compete in home vacuum robotics. 


Source: US Patent and Trademark Office (USTO.gov): Basic Word Mark Search > “Shark Ion Robot”


Coincidentally iRobot announced its patent complaints two days earlier on April 18, 2017 against 


Bissell, Hoover, b0bsweep, iLife, Black& Decker and three Asian companies. In our opinion, we believe 


IRBT’s recent patent claims are defensive, and it is clearly worried about its competitive position

Ecovacs Has Grown Market Share Against 
IRBT in Asia, Now Expanding Into the US


iRobot US/Asia Market Share – 2017


Ecovacs now 26% APAC market share


At 88% - US market share nowhere to go but down


• Aug 2016: ECOVACS plans to introduce seven new home cleaning robots in the US in 2016: five clean bare-floors 


and carpets, and two wipe glass doors and clean windows


• Feb 2017: Ecovacs Expands U.S. Footprint, Smart Home Technology; as part of its continuing global expansion 


plan, Ecovacs Robotics will move into its new 3,000-square-foot North American headquarters in San Francisco. 


The location of the new headquarters itself was chosen with the company’s expansion plans in mind and in large 


part due to its growing focus on smart home technology development.


• March 2017: Chinese robot vacuum maker ECOVACS to IPO on Shanghai Stock Exchange


Source: June 2017 IRBT Baird Presentation


In 2013, iRobot Asia Market Share Was 67% and 


Ecovacs was just 5%


It’s US market share was 83%


Source: 2014 IRBT Analyst Day


Ecovacs is taking clear steps to invade iRobot’s US market share. An IPO will raise capital and give it a public 


currency to continue its market share gains. We believe SharkNinja will partner with Ecovacs (next slide)

SharkNinja + Ecovacs = Trouble For IRBT


Spruce Point believes that SharkNinja and Ecovacs are likely to partner together to enter the robotic vacuum 


market. Below we have sourced a recent bill of lading shipping record from June 2017 showing a relationship 


exists between the two firms. It makes sense to us that SharkNinja’s market and distribution expertise in the 


US would be matched with the manufacturing and technology capabilities of Ecovacs.

Recent iRobot Performance A Result of 
Going Down Market, Deflating Prices


Based on our field research, we believe that iRobot has experienced the greatest growth by moving down 


market and selling into the $200 - $299 and $300 - $399 price segments. We believe it has used the IRBT 650 


series to be aggressive on price, and get market share gains. 


The pricing data below confirms our field research that. In the long run, we view this as a negative that iRobot, 


a retailer of a hardware consumer product, has to erode its brand value by lower prices. We expect margin 


pressure to result in the coming quarters, especially because iRobot has no more meaningful product 


introductions planned for next year.

• iRobot said in Q1 that “The $40.6 million increase in revenue from

was driven by a 28.0% increase in total units shipped and 


increased sales of our higher-priced Roomba 900 series robots as

New Signs Suggesting IRBT Is Gaming The 
Financials From Its Distributor Acquisition


There are clear signs of financial control issues at IRBT and “not getting its story straight” 


Notice That IRBT’s CFO Issues Corrective Statements About Japan’s Performance in Q4’16:  


• Original CFO Comment on Japan (Q4’16) “Austin just to circle back on your initial question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so 


without getting too specific, Japan was up probably about 20% in the fourth quarter year-on-year and China’s a fairly difficult comp


just based on the timing both last year and this year. So don’t read too much in to this, but it was over 200% growth in the fourth quarter on 


China. But again we encourage everybody to really focus on the full year growth rates for all of those regions versus Q4 specifically.”


• Revised CFO Comment on Japan (Q4’16)“Austin just to circle back on your initial question on Japan and China in the fourth quarter, so 


without getting too specific, Japan was [down 17%] (corrected by company after the call) in the fourth quarter year-on-year 


[because we wanted to make sure the channels were clear ahead of our acquisition and China was down 50% from Q4 last year 


as expected. As you may recall we received an $11M order in Q3 2016 from China that we were expecting in Q4 so China was up 


140% in Q3 and then down year-over-year in Q4] (corrected by company after the call). But again we encourage everybody to really 


focus on the full year growth rates for all of those regions versus Q4 specifically.”


• Then Following Quarter (Q1’17): “We have reduced our Japan expectations versus those provided in February due to our analysis of 


inventory at retailers in Japan at the end of Q1, which was higher than we would typically like to see. We have lowered the level of 


incremental revenue post acquisition as we work through this channel inventory.


Revision of Deal Terms and Financials Suggest More Inventory Acquired: The purchase price of the acquisition increased from earlier 


estimates. The purchase price is mostly inventory. The higher the purchase price, the more inventory acquired.


• 11/21/16 (press release): iRobot will acquire the business for a cash amount equal to the book value of the acquired assets at close, 


primarily inventory, estimated to be between $14m-$16m, subject to exchange rates in effect on the date of acquisition.


• 5/5/17  (Q1’10Q):  On April 3, 2017, the Company closed its previously-announced acquisition of the iRobot-related distribution business of 


Sales On Demand Corporation for approximately $18 million in cash, equal to the book value of the acquired assets. The acquisition price 


is subject to adjustments and will be finalized no later than May 18, 2017.


• Why does IRBT need 6 months to accurately account for and value inventory it acquired from its distributor? How hard is it to


count the number of unsold Roombas sitting in a warehouse and at retailers?


Financial Impact Revision From Distributor Acquisition Very Questionable


• Original sales increase from Japanese acquisition of $20-$25m and ($0.25) to ($0.35) EPS dilution  (Q4’16 Press Release)

Irrefutable Evidence of IRBT’s
Financial Control Concerns


iRobot’s Japanese forecasts simply aren’t adding up. 


Recall that it revised its sales contribution from $20 - $25m to $10 - $12m between Q4’16 and Q1’17


This revision amounts to between $10 - $13m lower sales


However, based on other statements made directly from management the expected revision


should have been just $4.7m - $7.0m. 


Therefore, we believe this is irrefutable evidence of financial control issues.

iRobot’s Extreme 
Valuation Disconnect

IRBT At Irrational Premium To Price 
Targets, Recent Brokers Are Negative


iRobot is trading at 30% above the average analyst price target; what do current investors know that its 


seasoned analysts don’t? We caution that Canaccord downgraded IRBT recently from Buy to Hold. 


Broker Recommendation Target


Canaccord Genuity Hold $90.00


Sidoti Neutral $87.00


Dougherty Buy $85.00


Piper Jaffray Neutral $68.00


JP Morgan Underweight $57.00


Average Price Target


% Downside From Current (1)
$77.40
-23%


1) Based on $101 share price


Canaccord Rationale For Downgrade 5/30/17: We are downgrading IRBT to HOLD from Buy following nearly a 70% 


appreciation for the stock YTD, and 50% PE expansion on consensus NTM earnings. While we remain positive on growth 


prospects for the company (healthy momentum in the U.S. as connectivity is driven deeper into the Roomba portfolio and 


accelerating international growth), we expect only modest upside to our estimates for the balance of the year and see 


little additional room for valuation expansion from present all-time highs. Further, the lack of a new flagship product in 


2017 could heighten uncertainty ahead of the holiday season and drive multiple compression. Our price target 


remains $90 and our estimates are unchanged.

IRBT At Irrational Premium To Peers


iRobot is trading at a steep multiple to peers on temporarily inflated numbers due to re-stocking the inventory 


channel, flattering of its financials from selling its strained military defense business, and boost from acquiring its 


Japanese distributor. Spruce Point believes none of these factors are sustainable and will result in very difficult 


comps in the future. iRobot is best viewed as stagnant technology hardware company with limited growth or 


innovation opportunities. As we’ve illustrated before, many of its previous product introductions such as health 


telepresence or lawn robots have failed to gain traction. For comparison, iRobot’s current valuation exceeds Apple 


(AAPL), which many would argue is the primer consumer technology company

Sales is the cleanest metric to value IRBT 
given our various concerns about earnings 


quality. For the sake of argument, we’ll 
assume IRBT can hit its 2017 sales, which we 


view as a cyclical peak, and apply a 
normalized valuation multiple range. iRobot 


has no new product introductions in the near 
term to drive revenues higher and we expect 


SharkNinja can achieve 10% market share 
when it enters robotics
