Globalstar: Would TLPS Even Work On Your Phone? Filtering Poses A
Major Threat To TLPS Usability

Summary


Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters need Channel 14 to act as a guard band to prevent Wi-
Fi and Sprint's 2.5GHz LTE spectrum from interfering with one another.


The most advanced filtering technology cannot function properly without a 10MHz+
guard band.


Therefore, the technology currently doesn't exist to allow unlicensed Wi-Fi, Channel
14 communications, and 2.5GHz LTE to all co-exist within the same phone.

This graph illustrates the impact that the filters inside many mobile devices have on Channel 14


signals: dramatic degradation. These filters are tiny devices that transform radio signals by allowing


certain frequencies through but suppressing others. The y axis measures the attenuation, or


suppression, of the signal. A more negative figure in decibels corresponds to a more attenuated


signal. The x axis measures the frequency of the signal. At the high-frequency edge of Channel 14,


the attenuation would be approximately 25 decibels -- a reduction in signal strength of more than


300 times.

One of the key purported advantages of Globalstar's (NYSEMKT:GSAT) Terrestrial Low
Power Service (TLPS) is the existence of a large number of 2.4GHz Wi-Fi devices that,
according to Globalstar, have the technical ability to transmit on its channel but are
prevented from doing so via firmware. As Globalstar wrote in its initial petition to the FCC
(p. 3),

802.11 compliant hardware is already capable of utilizing 802.11 Channel 14 with a
device firmware modification. This means that TLPS will benefit from a substantial
existing ecosystem, which can be utilized almost immediately.


Though "[m]ost if not all TLPS access points," in Globalstar's words (p. 42, footnote 105),
"will be newly manufactured equipment" under the control of a hypothetical "network
operating system" that will supposedly prevent interference to the company's satellite
customers, no one envisions TLPS-specific user devices. Instead, the dream put forth in,
for example, Globalstar's October 9 attempt to rebut our arguments, is that it will only take
"several months" following the finalization of the TLPS rule to enable the service in
popular devices like the iPhone.


Globalstar has neither the means nor the right to create, let alone disseminate, these
firmware updates, which would be specific to individual manufacturers and device models.
The manufacturers, likely in collaboration with chipset vendors, would have to choose to
undertake this work, for no apparent reward. Though this practical hurdle to deployment is
indeed serious, here we focus on a different concern: Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters.
Assume that an iPhone 6, Samsung Galaxy S5, or other popular user device did indeed
receive a firmware update that freed it to transmit on Channel 14. The problem is that
hardware filters inside many of these devices would severely impair the resulting signals.
In some cases, like the Avago filter shown above, a filter would attenuate the signal by a
factor of >200x before it even left the phone. Needless to say, this would degrade the
performance of TLPS, especially relative to Globalstar's ludicrous hype, and in some
scenarios could render it unusable. The entire point of these filters is to suppress
transmissions that lie outside of their "passbands," meaning the range of frequencies that
pass through the filter largely unscathed; since much of Channel 14 does lie outside of
their passbands, it's no surprise that the results could be disastrous.

Why has Globalstar never discussed (or perhaps even noticed) this problem? One likely
reason is that it has never actually tested TLPS using real user devices, at least according
to its experimental-license applications to the FCC, which have only mentioned access
points, not user devices like phones or tablets. In its recent ex parte letter responding to
some of our concerns, Globalstar did not even claim to have tested user devices,
speaking only of "access point transmissions" (p. 2). Without even attempting to connect
real devices to TLPS APs - perhaps because it has been unable to properly modify third-
party firmware for which it lacks the source code - Globalstar would be unlikely to come
across this problem. But it would obviously loom large in the mind of any potential partner.
After all, why pay billions for TLPS if the most popular mobile devices in the world can
barely use it?


Nor is there any easy fix. While we believe that similar coexistence filters would also
impair Channel 14 transmissions from many access points - indeed, even on the Ruckus
access points that Globalstar purportedly used for some of its testing - the impact is
potentially mitigated by Globalstar's intention to deploy custom APs (albeit at higher cost).
For user devices, however, the story is different. The filters used to prevent Wi-Fi signals
from interfering with nearby LTE bands are already high-performance, state-of-the-art
devices, yet it's already difficult for them to achieve the required signal rejection given how
narrow of a window they have to work with. (A very informative presentation submitted to
the FCC by a filter industry group characterized the 2.4GHZ Wi-Fi band as "very hard" to
handle given the tight spacing between it and the LTE bands on either side.) Channel 14
effectively is the guard band between the 2.4GHz ISM band used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth
and the neighboring higher-frequency LTE bands, like the Sprint-dominated Band 41
(2496-2690 MHz) - just as Globalstar's 1.6GHz uplink spectrum acts as a guard band
between GPS and other navigation frequencies and LightSquared's uplink band. In both
cases, Globalstar's bands have highly unattractive neighbors from the perspective of a
terrestrial deployment - a logical outcome since they were never originally intended to
serve that purpose. With so many shortcomings and technical challenges, TLPS has no
hope of warranting the $3 billion valuation that the equity market has given it. Globalstar
remains dramatically overvalued.


I. What Is Wi-Fi/LTE Coexistence?

The Japanese electronics manufacturer TDK provided a good summary of Wi-Fi/LTE
coexistence problems in a recent press release announcing its new "high-performance
WLAN-Bluetooth filter for smartphones":


RF spectrum is a limited resource and with the continuously growing number of
communication services it is becoming ever more densely populated. In particular,
the WLAN and Bluetooth band between 2400 MHz and 2483 MHz is separated by
just ≤20 MHz from the new band 7, 40 and 41 that are used for LTE cellular service.
Thanks to the new filter's excellent insertion loss and high out-of-band selectivity, the
B8831 is able to prevent the signals in the adjacent WLAN/Bluetooth and highband
cellular bands from interfering with each other.


But TDK is far from the first entrant into this market. For years, Avago (NASDAQ:AVGO)
and TriQuint (TQNT), which is on the eve of combining with RF Micro Devices (RFMD) to
form a new firm called Qorvo, have dominated the world of high-performance RF filters,
including Wi-Fi coexistence filters - and their stocks have delivered excellent returns along
the way. As early as its February 2011 investor day, TriQuint flagged Wi-Fi coexistence as
a key opportunity:

And the final piece, 4G wireless LAN coexistence. Sprint came out with basically 4G
WiMAX, but then wireless LAN capability in terms of personal hot spots, and then
was also looking to do it in phones. And what we're seeing is any type of application,
whether it be a mobile application or a fixed network application, that puts those two
together creates opportunity because the frequency spectrum is so close to each
other, you need very, very tight filtering requirements now at very high frequencies to
be able to handle that. And that's created an opportunity with our BAW filtering
technology and leveraged a lot of our growth here this past year. (Source:
Bloomberg transcript of TriQuint 2011 Investor Day, February 23, 2011)


These comments echoed those of other organizations. In March 2010, the Bluetooth
Special Interest Group released Filter Recommendations for Coexistence with LTE and
WiMAX, noting that "based on information from the filter manufacturers shown in Appendix
B: Available Filter Performance, a reasonable bandwidth of such a guard band [between
the 2.4GHz band used by Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and neighboring LTE bands] is 20 MHz,"
though it noted that "some WiMAX deployments" - now undergoing conversion to LTE -
"start at 2496 MHz which reduces the guard band to 16 MHz" (p. 9). As this language
shows, filter-makers disregarded the barely used, vestigial Channel 14 (centered on 2484
MHz), characterizing it as part of the guard band and making no effort to preserve its
functionality. In December 2011, the global telecom consortium 3GPP, which develops the
rules for LTE, released a technical report on "in-device coexistence," drawing in part on a
prior study by Motorola that assumed the use of a high-performance, Channel 14-
impairing Avago ACPF-7024 filter. IWPC, a telecom industry group, published a study in
April 2013 examining RF Front-End Architectures for 2.3-2.7 GHz 4G Global Roaming
Devices; the study concluded in part that "LTE bands can be adequately protected from an
in-device Wi-Fi radio by a single post-[power amplifier] filter on the Wi-Fi device with 40-45
dB rejection" (p. 85). 40-45 dB equates to a factor of 10,000x to ~32,000x signal
attenuation - an enormous degree of "rejection." Given that Channel 14 lies right between
the Wi-Fi band that these filters are designed to let through and the LTE bands they are
designed to protect with massive amounts of rejection, Channel 14 is firmly and
unavoidably in the cross-hairs.


Though different device models contain different filters, it's clear that the high-performance
filters that do the greatest damage to Channel 14 are widespread. For example, in 2013,
TriQuint announced that its LTE/Wi-Fi coexistence filter was included in Broadcom's
reference designs for 802.11ac mobile devices. In 2014, it announced yet more wins:

TriQuint also launched a family of three high-performance filters to solve challenging
Wi-Fi / LTE interference issues. Utilizing TriQuint's bulk acoustic wave (BAW)
technology, these advanced filters enable customers to extend Wi-Fi ranges while
meeting stringent spectrum regulations worldwide. TriQuint has already secured
multiple design wins for these filters in Wi-Fi access points, home media gateways
and automotive infotainment markets.


TriQuint specifically touted one of its new models, the 885070, as the "first BAW filter to
provide guaranteed band-edge rejection in restricted FCC bands at 2390MHz &
2483.5MHz." In other words, this filter is guaranteed to wipe out the entire upper half of
Channel 14.


Because filters are small (e.g. the ACPF is 1.6x2.0x0.95 millimeters) and sometimes
unlabeled, "teardown" analyses in which engineers take apart new mobile devices to
examine their components sometimes overlook them (see footnote 1 below). Nonetheless,
semiconductor analysts have identified high-performance Wi-Fi coexistence filters in many
popular devices. For example, in April Barclays identified an Avago "WLAN coexist FBAR"
(a specific type of filter) in the Samsung Galaxy S5:

In September, Barclays also identified TriQuint "WLAN co-exist" filters in the
US/Canada/Europe and China/Other versions of the iPhone 6, an increase over the
iPhone 5S/5C, where it identified such filters in only a subset of models.

These much-scrutinized, best-selling devices are not unique in their reliance on strict
filtering of the 2.4GHz Wi-Fi band. During TriQuint's April 2014 earnings call, its CEO
noted that "the Wi-LAN business associated with co-existence filters, that's our fastest-
growing product line right now." Not just user devices but access points now boast more
selective filters. Aruba, for example, advertises "advanced cellular coexistence," while
Ruckus notes that it too employs a "2.4 GHz ISM filter" (slide 11).


In short, Wi-Fi/LTE coexistence filters are pervasive in mobile devices as well as access
points. They're needed in order to prevent Wi-Fi and LTE interfering with one another.
Because Channel 14 is effectively unused, filter-makers have not attempted to protect it in
their efforts to keep the 2.4GHz ISM band and neighboring LTE bands from harming one
another. As a result, any device that contains such filters will perform poorly and
unpredictably when set to Channel 14 - even if a firmware modification allows it.
Depending on the filter in place, the impact could be drastic.

To estimate the impact of coexistence filtering on Channel 14, we have used data sheets
from the filter vendors TriQuint and Avago, drawing on the performance graphs that they
provide in order to zero in on the expected level of attenuation within the bounds of the
channel. Since filter performance varies based on temperature and other factors - and
even varies from one tiny unit to the next based on small fluctuations in the manufacturing
process - these are only estimates. But they highlight yet another enormous practical
headache for any TLPS deployment - one that, as usual, Globalstar has never publicly
acknowledged.

passband only, while the reduction in out-of-band emissions is called "rejection.") Since
measurements in decibels can be unintuitive to those without RF experience, we also
express the insertion loss as a straightforward ratio.


In most cases, at the center of Channel 14, the attenuation is ~3 dB, equivalent to a
halving in signal strength. By the edge of the channel at 2494 MHz, however, the
attenuation in all cases becomes extremely severe, ranging from ~12.5 dB (18x reduction
in signal strength) to ~26.9 dB (491x reduction in signal strength). The effects of
attenuating some of the subcarriers within the channel by large amounts and others by
less are difficult to predict without conducting extensive real-world tests, but at a minimum
these reductions in signal strength would greatly limit propagation - ironic given
Globalstar's insistence that TLPS would boast superior range over conventional Wi-Fi.


Below we show the performance graphs for each device, highlighting the relevant zone for
Channel 14. (The ACFF-1024 was already illustrated on the first page.)
