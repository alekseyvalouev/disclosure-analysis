THE SIMILARITIES
BETWEEN MADOFF AND
HARBIN ELECTRIC


This past week, a new film documentary premiered
entitled “Chasing Madoff”.

It chronicles now famed whistleblower Harry
Markopolos, whose longstanding battle to get the
SEC to take action against the massive Ponzi
scheme perpetrated by Madoff & Co. had been
documented for years. 


To this day, Markopolos’s letter to the SEC in 2005
(which wasn’t his first, his first formal complaint to
the SEC was made in early 2000), remains a
classic in common sense insight for investors. 
Citron believes it should be required reading for
every market participant, legislator and regulator.

After recently re-reading “No One Would Listen”,
this writer couldn’t help but see the similarities
between Madoff and Harbin Electric.  Before you
dismiss this as a stretch … consider a few points.


   Similarities between Madoff and
Harbin:

5/18/2018 The Similarities Between Madoff and Harbin Electric – Citron Research

1)  Off-the-charts financial results that defy
independent verification


Madoff reported earning 12% or more almost
every year, while never disclosing how he did it.


Harbin has doubled revenue each of the last
two years, to a run rate of over $500 million
per year, meanwhile claiming net margins
besting peer competitors by orders of
magnitude.  Yet it does not disclose a single
verifiable large customer or large scale order
with a verifiable counterparty. Its major
customers from prior years’ filings state little or
no business conducted with Harbin.


2)  Investors who know something fishy is
going on, but stay involved


Many of Madoff’s investors suspected he was
doing something “wrong” (i.e. frontrunning
orders), but invested anyway, because they
figured he was on their side — as long as they
could profit from his cheating, then cheating
was OK.


Harbin investors have submitted hundreds of
emails to Citron.  But not a single one has ever
credibly defended the company’s business. 
Instead, they all assert the theme of “who
cares if there is a business or not….we are
getting taken over.”


3)  Investors focus on credentials and not
business


Madoff derived credibility because he was
Chairman of the Board of Directors and a
member of Board of Governors
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_of_Governors]
of the NASD.


Harbin’s Chairman Tianfu Yang derives
credibility because he is a Deputy in the
National People’s Congress.


4)  Professional Industry counterparties keep
their distance

Many qualified market participants concluded
Madoff was a fraud.  But while Madoff's wealth
management business grew into a multi-billion-
dollar operation, none of the major derivatives
firms would trade with him because they
concluded his numbers and his strategy were
fictional.


Even though Harbin Electric has engaged
numerous experts in its going-private process,
the major firm analysts are all mute, large firm
arb desks aren’t taking the “easy money” bait,
and short-sellers can’t even short the stock
because the borrow is so tight, all while the
stock trades at 2/3rds of the takeout price. 


5)  Family members in key positions of trust


Madoff’s right hand man was his brother Peter
Madoff who served as Chief Compliance Officer
for 20 years.


Tianfu Yang’s right hand man is his brother
Tianli Yang, who is Vice President of Harbin
Electric and a director of subsidiaries.


6)  The low credibility auditor


Despite being surrounded by white shoe
pedigree peers, Madoff’s auditor was
Friehling & Horowitz, a little known accounting
firm that has since been sued and put out of
business.


Despite its going private documents festooned
with pedigree white shoe names (every one of
which explicitly disclaims any actual due
diligence), Harbin’s auditors are Frazer Frost,
a now disbanded and disgraced auditing firm
which has been sued by the SEC and whose
client list is the poster child for China stock
fraud.


7)  Constantly raising expensive money
despite claiming wildly profitable operations


Madoff continued to pay large acquisition fees
to feeder funds, despite a business that
purported to be massively profitable.

Harbin’s Chairman Yang had to pledge the
majority of his stock for an expensive $50
million loan.  The company also is indebted to a
patchwork of banks, pledging various assets,
while the company claims nearly $100 million
in cash on the balance sheet, and hugely
profitable operations, that never relieves its
insatiable needs for cash.


   …But … One Major Difference


 


When Madoff’s fraud was finally exposed,
there were consequences … serious
consequences, as in a 150 year jail term, and
asset seizure.


Citron believes the Harbin Electric deal is likely
to “fall apart” at the last minute due to
unexplained circumstances, which will likely be
conveniently blamed on “regulators” and “short
sellers”. 


But when it goes south, nobody at Harbin
will be accountable, either legally or
financially.  The utter lack of civil or criminal
jurisdiction over the principals in China assures
that shareholders will have zero recourse. 


Although there have been dozens of China RTO
frauds exposed, not one penny has been
recovered for shareholders by legal action, and
not a single indictment of a culpable party has
been executed.


    Conclusion


Citron alerts investors that, as currently
structured, and absent regulatory intervention,
this purported buyout can proceed all the way
to the altar with not a single dollar escrowed to
protect investors from being jilted at the last
minute. 


The impressive-sounding white shoe names on
the documents have all indemnified themselves
with broad disclaimers.

For those following the case of CHBT, a China
RTO fraud stock tracked by Citron for nearly a
year, the real liquidity only poured into the
stock in the final weeks immediately prior to
the deadline for its audited annual report.


The entire Harbin take-private transaction
depends on massive bank financing from one of
China’s state financing agencies, an entity
which customarily underwrites massive
infrastructure development projects for
widespread social benefit, not leveraged private
equity deals to profit selected Hong Kong fund
operators.  It remains utterly unclear how far
this bank will deviate from their clearly stated
policies of state and social interest to
underwrite this dubious transaction.


Investors need look no further than the recent
cases of Sino Forest and Longtop, whose stocks
had no floor when the music stopped.  Billions
in investor assets simply disappeared into the
mists.


 


Cautious investing to all.
