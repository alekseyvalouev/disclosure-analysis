Aurelius’ research.  Aurelius will not update any report or information
on this website to re�ect such positions or changes in such
positions.


Please note that Aurelius, the author of this report, and the “Aurelius

Management, LP, a private investment �rm based in New York, and
any a�liates of or funds managed by the latter company.


—–


Up until now, an online pet pharmacy named PetMed Express
(NASDAQ: PETS) has been able to conceal its efforts to exploit
America’s Opioid Epidemic.


In 2015, Opioids killed 33,091 people, equivalent to one overdose
death every 15 minutes.  Within the past several months, many
government agencies have announced Opioid task forces while
Attorney Generals have expanded investigations into the “pill mills”
feeding the epidemic. This month, President Trump formally
designated the opioid crisis a national emergency.


PetMed’s origins trace to convicted felons named Yali Golan and
Engin Yesil, who were imprisoned in the early 1990s for conspiracy
to distribute Cocaine. Mr. Golan’s status as PetMed’s co-founder was
hidden from investors through shell entities at the time of the
company’s IPO.  PetMed’s CEO, Menderes Akdag worked for almost
a decade at Lens Express, a company that Golan and Yesil founded.


Faced with increasing competition, PetMed’s business had
stagnated for most of the past seven years before sales and
earnings suddenly began to surge.  Having posted the best �nancial
results in the company’s history over the past two quarters, PETS
shares have skyrocketed.


Yet PetMed operates as a distributor without proprietary products in
a mature industry–not exactly the dynamics that lead to sudden
windfall pro�ts. Cryptically, Mr. Akdag has repeatedly credited the
company’s change in fortunes to a purported “shift to new
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 3/35


generation medications”, a narrative that has enticed unsuspecting
investors.


But Mr. Akdag must have thought no one would scrutinize his claims.


It is our belief that the actual “secret sauce” lies in PetMed’s efforts
to aggressively market dangerous painkillers to human opiate
addicts and drug users.


Mr. Akdag and his team sell painkillers coveted by human opiate
addicts.  Chief among these is a dangerous and addicting synthetic
opiate named Tramadol, unique in that it is prescribed by vets to
animals as well as by doctors to human cancer patients. The
demand for Tramadol, a class IV substance, is now so high that
addicts are even maiming their pets to get prescriptions.


PetMed is exploiting this crisis through a broad marketing blitz that
features Tramadol in ads that speci�cally target human opiate users.


Using Google, which drives over 55% of the tra�c to
1800petmeds.com, PetMed has deployed a vast predatory campaign
that dangles ads featuring pictures of Tramadol to drug users
searching for how to get high or quickly score a variety of different
opiates, narcotics, and street drugs without a prescription.
Egregiously, PetMed’s ads even speci�cally bait opiate addicts
searching for remedies for their withdrawal symptoms.


Online advertising is the lifeblood of PetMed’s business and,
according to data cited in this report, Tramadol ads are estimated to
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 4/35


drive at least 25% of PetMed’s paid search tra�c. It is no
coincidence, in our view, that PetMed has reported record �nancial
results over the same period that its opiate ad campaign has
expanded.


We believe that PetMed’s marketing of dangerous drugs to human
opiate addicts is likely to capture the attention of regulators. Both the
FDA and DEA have taken a dim view of direct to consumer
advertisements of controlled substances and we can �nd no
precedent of a pet pharmacy advertising to humans.


More immediately, Google can bring a sudden halt to PetMed’s
activities. Google has recently been on “a rampage” against
predatory ads and we have noti�ed Google of PetMed’s advertising
tactics. Google has strict policies for advertisers and, in our opinion,
Google could choose to suspend or ban PetMed altogether.


PETS trades at over 30x earnings and 3x sales, a valuation that
suggests the party will continue inde�nitely.  But for most of the last
decade, PETS shares were valued at substantially lower multiples.
 As the true nature of PetMed’s activities come to light, at minimum,
we see shares reverting to below their average historical valuation,
which would imply a sub $20 stock and 50%+ downside.


Petmed’s “New Generation Medications”


PetMed Express is an online veterinary pharmacy that sells pet
medications through www.1800petmeds.com. Faced with increased
competition, the business had stagnated for most of the past seven
years.  PetMed’s revenues and pro�ts were actually lower in FY 2016
than they were in FY 2010.


But then suddenly PetMed’s business began to boom.


Over the past two quarters, PetMed has posted the best �nancial
results in the company’s history. During the March 2017 quarter (FY
Q4), PETS sales grew by a full 14%, the company’s best growth rate
in roughly 8 years.  EPS surged to 37 cents, PetMed’s single most
pro�table quarter ever.



http://www.1800petmeds.com/
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 5/35


The most recent June 2017 quarter (FY Q1) was similarly
spectacular with sales growing by 10% and EPS growing by 39% to a
windfall 46 cents per share.


As �nancial results have taken off, PETS shares more than doubled
to all-time highs.


So, what is really behind the sudden improvement in PetMed’s
fortunes?


PetMed is merely a veterinary medicine distributor with no
proprietary products of its own.  This is a mature and highly
competitive industry with a host of other online pet pharmacies that
now include PetSmart.


These are not exactly the industry dynamics that lead to record
growth and pro�tability. Yet PetMed appears to have found a “secret
sauce”. When questioned on recent conference calls about the
drivers of PETS recent success, Mr. Akdag has repeatedly referred to
supposed “new generation medications”.


After the blockbuster results in the March 2017 quarter, an analyst
from Craig Hallum, a sell-side research �rm who currently has a hold
rating on the stock, asked Mr. Akdag to give more speci�cs.  Akdag
replied “all I’m going to say is there is a shift to new generation
medications”, later highlighting that PETS spent 17% more on
advertising as part of the company’s online ad shift.

7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 6/35


An almost identical exchange occurred during the most recent
earnings call.  Mr. Akdag highlighted an increase in online ad spend
before again referencing a “shift to new generation medications”
without elaborating.


Petmed’s Covert Campaign to Target Opiate Addicts and Drug Users


It’s important to understand that online marketing is the lifeblood of
PetMed’s business. To sell its products, PetMed must drive a
constant stream of potential customers to its website.  This requires
spending a signi�cant amount of money to advertise on Google, the
world’s dominant digital ad platform. According to data from SEM
Rush (an online marketing intelligence service that we describe later)
Google referred roughly 55% of the total visitors to
1800petmeds.com.


Bulls view PetMed’s online marketing skills as a competitive
advantage.  PetMed’s board includes two Directors from comScore,
a leading digital marketing analytics company, including comScore’s
founder and CEO, Gian Fulgoni.  After PETS discontinued TV-based
advertising in favor of more online ads last year, Craig Hallum even
anointed PetMed as “the poster child for the e�ciency of online
versus TV, just very impressive”.  


But what makes PetMed such an effective online advertiser? And
what are Mr. Akdag’s “new generation medications”?


In a report issued earlier this year, Craig Hallum postulated that the
�nancial results are being driven by “greater adoption of oral



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ComScore

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3991190-petmed-express-pets-ceo-menderes-akdag-q1-2016-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 7/35


medications, such as �ea & tick products NexGard, Bravecto, and
Simparica”.


But if these products were driving the results, then we should expect
to see them featured prominently in PetMed’s online marketing
campaign.


Yet they aren’t


Instead, our research demonstrates that the centerpiece of PetMed’s
marketing efforts are human crossover painkillers.


Mr. Akdag and his team sell painkillers coveted by human opiate
addicts.  Chief among these is a dangerous and addictive synthetic
opiate named Tramadol, unique in that it is prescribed by vets to
animals as well as by doctors to human cancer patients.


Tramadol is Class IV controlled substance that is at the center of the
Opioid Crisis in many foreign countries and increasingly fueling a
wave of addiction and abuse in the United States. Tramadol can have
a stronger impact on users than Morphine and produces opioid
effects similar to Oxycontin, even producing seizures within the
recommended dosage range.


For years, PetMed did not sell controlled substances because, as an
old SEC �ling explained, “we believe dispensing these drugs carries
with it increased risks, including fraud, illegal resale of prescription
drugs, as well as the special storage, shipping and handling
requirements.”


After Tramadol was made a Class IV Substance by the DEA in
August 2014, competitors stopped selling it.  PetMed, by contrast,
obtained federal and state registrations in FY 2015 allowing it to
dispense class IV substances.


As a result, PetMed appears to be the only major online Pet
Pharmacy currently selling Tramadol.

(Source: Internal Research Checks. Includes PetMed’s major online
competitors measured by advertising activity we analyzed in SEM
Rush)


As the Opioid epidemic has expanded, Mr. Akdag and his team have
deployed an aggressive ad campaign featuring Tramadol to prey on
opioid addicts.


PetMed ads now dangle pictures of Tramadol to drug users
searching for how to get high or quickly purchase a variety of
different opiates, narcotics, and street drugs without a prescription.
Egregiously, these ads speci�cally target opiate addicts by marketing
Tramadol to people searching to detox or for remedies for their
withdrawal symptoms.


This vast predatory campaign includes ads that can generally be
categorized into three primary categories (Below).


Note:  We captured and archived a considerable number of PetMed’s
Google ads that were live this month along with search keywords
archived by SEM Rush as having been used by PetMed at some point
in the past (displayed in red).  Please see the appendix for a more
expansive archive of PetMed’s ads.

1. PetMed Baits Human Opiate Users and Addicts


PetMed displays ads that target people looking to get high or
purchase a wide variety of dangerous drugs. Petmed’s Tramadol pills
are �ashed alongside searches for drugs including Oxycontin,
Oxycodone, Vicodin, Hydrocodone, Conzepam, and even “Pink Pills”
(Synthetic Heroin).


Ads have also been displayed on searches for Ultram (Human
Tramadol), “Trammies” (the street name) and Tramadol formulations
not recommended for pets. PetMed also targets non-recreational
users by marketing its drugs to people merely searching for
remedies for their back pain, tooth ache, joint paint, or arthritis.

PetMed Goes “All In” On Its Opiate Campaign
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 15/35


It is our opinion that the actual “secret sauce” lies in PetMed’s efforts
to aggressively market dangerous painkillers to human opiate
addicts and drug users.  Two of the strongest �nancial reports in the
company’s history have coincided with the expansion of the Opiate
advertising campaign.  In our view, this isn’t a coincidence.


We gathered intelligence on the scope of PetMed’s Opiate campaign
using SEM Rush, an analytics platform that tracks and archives
Google advertisements on 120 million search keywords (Read more
about SEM’s data here). SEM Rush provides insight into what
keywords PetMed emphasizes, how its advertising dollars are being
allocated, and estimates how much web tra�c its ads on various
keywords are driving.


Prior to 2017, data from SEM rush shows that PetMed’s online
advertising was centered around predictable keywords related to
PetMed’s brand and common pet drugs.  For example, as of
December 2016, 22% of the website tra�c was being driven by ads
on searches for “1800petmeds” with another 8% coming from
“comfortis”, a popular �ea medicine.


December 2016:


That changed earlier this year. Suddenly in February, SEM Rush
shows that “gabapentin high” became a top 10 tra�c generator.


Gabapentin is a psychoactive drug prescribed for humans to treat
nerve damage and to alleviate pain in animals.  The drug is
increasingly being abused nationwide and is often used in
conjunction with opioids to both increase the high and decrease the
withdrawal symptoms.  As a result, the opioid epidemic has sent
human demand for Gabapentin surging.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 16/35


February 2017:


By April, the data indicates that PetMed went full throttle with its
ongoing Tramadol ad blitz.


According to data from SEM Rush, Tramadol is PetMed’s single
most effective advertising term, driving roughly 25% of the total
paid search tra�c to 1800Petmeds.com.   This includes search
terms like “Tramadol High” where we have continued to see PetMed
ads.


August, 2017:


We also engaged an online marketing expert to complete an analysis
of PetMed’s Tramadol ad campaign.  The expert found that PetMed
often ranks number one in Tramadol search terms, meaning that the
company is paying more to advertise on these terms and also
getting high click through rates on its ads. The expert also noted that
7/10/2019 PetMed: Exploiting America's Opioid Epidemic - Aurelius Value


www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 17/35


PetMed’s ads offer discounts for Tramadol (below) and, notably, fail
to explicitly state the medication is for Pets.


Backdoor Opiate Dispensary?


PetMed’s origins trace to convicted felons named Yali Golan and
Engin Yesil who were imprisoned in the early 1990s for conspiracy to
distribute Cocaine.


As described in a 2006 Barron’s article, Mr. Golan’s status as co-
founder was hidden from investors by using shell entities to conceal
his holdings at the time of PETS IPO.


Mr. Golan and Engin Yesil were business partners and founded a
different company named Lens Express together. Prior to its IPO,
PetMed received a cash infusion from a Gibraltar trust tied to Mr.
Yesil’s family.  The Gibraltrar trust became PetMed’s largest
shareholder, owning over 10% of the �oat, until a 2006 SEC �ling
reported that it no longer was the bene�cial owner of more than 5%.


Neither Golan or Yesil have any current role at the company that
we’re aware of, but prior to joining Petmeds in 2001, Mr. Akdag
worked for almost a decade at Lens Express.


In 2002, PetMed was charged by the Florida Pharmacy Board for
allegedly creating a program involving contracts with veterinarians to
write prescriptions for animals they never actually examined.  As
described by the prosecutor,


“essentially, Petmed was engaged in an enterprise whereby a
customer could log onto their website, �ll out a questionnaire
regarding their animal’s health complaints, and that information would
then be forwarded to a veterinarian who was either employed by, or
under contract with, Petmed”

The company went on to settle the charges in Florida, without
admitting guilt, along with similar charges in Ohio and Texas. A
signi�cant amount of time has passed since these regulatory
settlements and, as far as we can tell, the company has kept out of
regulatory trouble since.


However, this brings up a fundamental question of why PetMed
spends money to speci�cally target opiate users and addicts who
have no prescriptions?


Addicts without prescriptions, by de�nition, should be impossible for
PetMed to convert into paying customers.  But PetMed is too savvy
of an online marketer to be spending ad dollars without getting a
�nancial return.


The most likely explanation for the company’s expansion of its
opiate marketing campaign, in our opinion, is that Mr. Akdag and his
team must know that opiate addicts are getting drugs from PetMed.


Approximately 56% of Americans own either a cat or dog and these
animals are now increasingly being used to score drugs for their
owners. Shockingly, the demand for Tramadol has become so high
that opiate addicts have resorted to maiming their pets to procure
prescriptions.


Other reports suggest that “Vet Shopping” has increased, whereby
drug users take their pet to numerous vets to get drug prescriptions,
primarily Tramadol.

www.aureliusvalue.com/research/petmed-exploiting-americas-opioid-epidemic/ 19/35


A grisly post we found in an online forum (below), of parents
intercepting 200 Tramadol pills shipped by Petmeds to their addicted
daughter for a dead dog, was posted six years ago and suggests
addicts have been using PetMed for a while.


PetMed’s Opiate marketing campaign may have simply fanned these
existing �ames.


Orders for Tramadol and other painkillers are approved through
PetMed’s in-house prescription authorization system that Craig
Hallum has touted as being “overlooked and under-appreciated” due
to its “high order �ll rate for prescription medications, over 80%”.


In an April 2017 report, Craig Hallum explained that PetMed
customers “often do not have to talk to anyone to get a prescription
�lled…86% of customers go to 1800petmeds.com and �ll out an
order for prescription pet medication, then PETS’ in-house
procurement staff will contact the appropriate veterinarian”.  We
con�rmed this with PetMeds support who explained that customers
can submit orders before they have prescriptions and PetMeds then
contacts the vet to obtain a prescription for the customer. Craig
Hallum also noted that vets rarely “make it di�cult and require

Stories of human “pill mill” closures abound, whereby corrupt
doctors have been caught churning out massive quantities of
prescriptions for painkillers in return for cash under the table. 
However, media reports documenting the existence of veterinary pill
mills are sparse.


The controls for veterinary prescription controls are looser than for
physicians.  Doctor shopping can be thwarted through Prescription
Drug Monitoring Programs, active in 49 states and the District of
Columbia, which track prescriptions made by physicians to patients
(logging social security numbers). However, most states don’t
require vets to report their prescription activity.


Now vets are still bound by state prescription laws, many of which
require a Veterinarian-Client-Patient Relationship, and we doubt
many vets are knowingly writing bogus prescriptions.  However,
PetMed’s authorization system could be so easy and seamless that
it is easier for drug addicts to game.


We invite whistleblowers to contact us (here) to help us better
understand how Tramadol and other painkillers are being procured
from PetMed.  Anyone with relevant information or stories is
encouraged to come forward.

Our thesis is that PetMed’s earnings surge is being driven by the
company’s opiate marketing campaign.  As such, we view PetMed’s
record pro�ts as being inherently unsustainable and likely to end.


Yet at present, PETS shares appear to be valued as if the party will
go on forever. The stock trades at over 30x times earnings and 3x
sales which represent multiples far above the company’s respective
10 year average of 17x and 1.5x (below).


As the true nature of PetMed’s activities come to light, at minimum,
we see shares reverting to below their average historical valuation,
which would imply a sub $20 stock and 50%+ downside.


Earning windfall pro�ts amidst a national opioid emergency, we
believe PetMed’s activities will likely capture the attention of
regulators.  Both the FDA and DEA have historically taken a dim view
of direct to consumer advertisements of controlled substances and
we could �nd no precedent of a pet pharmacy advertising drugs to
humans.


Importantly, Google can bring an immediate end to PetMed’s opiate
ad campaign.


We have noti�ed Google of PetMed’s advertising tactics. Google has
a strict “zero tolerance” policy for bad advertisers and, in our opinion,
could choose to ban PetMed as an advertiser.


In 2011, Google agreed to pay $500 million to avoid Justice
Department charges that it knowingly accepted illegal

advertisements from Canadian online pharmacies for years.  Google
has recently been on “a rampage” against bad ads, taking down over
1.7 billion ads that violated its policies in 2016 and has banned
hundreds of thousands of advertisers since 2014.


As quoted in a Wired pro�le from earlier this year, Google’s Director
of Product management explained that “In the past year, what’s really
changed is that we’ve expanded our policies so we can better protect
consumers against issues like misleading ads and predatory offers”. 
Last year, for example, Google banned all payday loan ads from its
website.


We believe PetMeds has been able to abuse Google’s ad platform
because it technically sells a legal product, at least when its
prescribed for pets with legitimate prescriptions.  But the
fundamental problem is that PetMeds is using Google to �ash ads of
dangerous drugs to entice human drug users and addicts—people
who PetMeds should not legally be able to sell to.


We are con�dent that Google will do the right thing.
