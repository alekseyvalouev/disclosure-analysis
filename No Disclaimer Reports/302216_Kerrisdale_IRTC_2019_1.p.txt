We are short shares of iRhythm Technologies, a $2.3bn medical device company trading at 


over 15x sales despite facing multiple factors that will dramatically cut its revenue growth in the 


coming years. iRhythm’s Zio, developed over a decade ago and accounting for nearly all the 
company’s $150m in sales, is a one-lead heart rate monitor in patch form. This “extended Holter 


monitor” is worn by patients for up to 14 days, during which the device continuously records 
heart rhythm data. Each application of a Zio patch costs payors about two to four times what it 


would cost to use legacy monitoring modalities, but iRhythm claims that the Zio reduces costs 


for the healthcare system through increased effectiveness and better patient compliance. 
 


A closer look at the circumstances surrounding the reimbursement treatment of the Zio Patch 
reveals that at the core of iRhythm’s revenue base is an exceedingly generous, but increasingly 


fragile, reimbursement regime. The Zio patch’s success in achieving unit-level revenues greater 


than any other cardiac monitoring method is a function of iRhythm’s subtle and skillful 
maneuvering around the arcane technicalities at the center of the American Medical 


Association’s reimbursement coding process. This has allowed iRhythm to essentially “name its 
own price” in the Medicare negotiation process, leading to unduly favorable reimbursement from 


commercial payors as well. 


 
But the price gouging will inevitably be short-lived. The rapid increase in Zio patch utilization has 


now put a bullseye on its back, increasing the odds that both Medicare and commercial payors 
will both cut back on reimbursement levels and throttle utilization. In addition, the Zio patch is 


currently reimbursed under a temporary CPT tracking code that we expect will be transitioned 


into a permanent code for calendar year 2021. In the process, we anticipate reimbursement 
levels for the Zio patch will fall by over a third, and potentially more than 50%. 


 
Reimbursement cuts are not iRhythm’s only problem. Until recently, the Zio patch was the only 


product available in a category that it was responsible for creating. But the simplicity of the Zio 


and its commercial success have attracted competition, and new entrants have both superior 
devices and more diversified device portfolios. Up to now, iRhythm has successfully used 


favorable clinical studies and enterprise integration capabilities to win business. But competitors 


are now promoting the superiority of their own devices, backed by more recently published data 
that reflects much less favorably on iRhythm. They’re also offering more flexible solutions that 


appeal to a broader array of customers, such as larger enterprises. As a result, iRhythm will find 
it increasingly difficult to win business with large hospital systems and physician groups. In 


addition to market share losses, the specter of price competition from these peers looms large. 


 
iRhythm has recently tried to diversify by extending its Zio patch into the real-time cardiac 


monitoring space with its Zio AT device. But the attempt appears to be too little, too late. 
Extensive discussions with industry participants and new disclosures in the company’s filings 


indicate that, contrary to iRhythm’s attestations in its most recent earnings call, iRhythm has 


pulled back on the AT. In fact, the product can no longer even be found on the company’s 
website. That leaves iRhythm as a one-hit wonder with a shrinking reimbursement revenue pool 


and a slew of superior competition. As the only single product company in the cardiac 
monitoring space, iRhythm has already missed the beat. The results could be fatal.

I. Investment Highlights 
 


iRhythm faces reimbursement cuts of 30-60% in the near future. Close to all of iRhythm’s 


revenue is derived from its Zio XT Extended Holter patch, and the vast majority of that is not 


through the sale of the device to physicians and hospitals, but by billing third party payors for 


the scanning analysis and report, which are performed at an iRhythm Independent Diagnostic 


and Testing Facility (IDTF). The level of reimbursement for that step of the process, like any 


medical procedure, is dependent upon the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes under 


which the procedure is reimbursed. CPT codes are overseen by the American Medical 


Association (AMA) and medical procedures can be associated with a few different types of CPT 


codes, depending on the level of recognition they receive from the AMA and the relevant 


specialty societies.  





iRhythm generates almost all its revenue through billing third party payors for CPT code 0297T, 


the letter “T” indicating that the reimbursement code is a Category III tracking code. The AMA 


describes Category III codes as “temporary alphanumeric codes for new and developing 


technology, procedures and services,” a description that certainly fit the Zio patch when its 


temporary CPT code was first approved in July of 2011. But that was 8 years ago. The CPT 


system provides for automatic sunset of Category III reimbursement codes 5 years after 


implementation, whereupon they can expire, be renewed for a further five years if they are still 


“developing,” or be transitioned to Category I “permanent” codes if the underlying procedure has 


become more widespread and supported by literature.  





Notwithstanding at least some success on both the utilization and literature fronts in the 2013 to 


2015 period, the temporary CPT codes associated with the Zio patch were renewed in February 


of 2016 and are currently slated to be reconsidered by the CPT Editorial Panel in early 2021. 


Given the recent explosion in the utilization of extended Holter monitors and the literature 


supporting their use, the relevant CPT codes will almost certainly be transitioned to Category I 


codes for use in the 2023 calendar year. Because Category I codes receive special scrutiny 


from the AMA’s Relative Value Scale Update Committee (RUC), reimbursement rates for 


procedures typically drop by about a third when they move from Category III to Category I, 


according to several former RUC members we’ve spoken with. 





In the case of the 0297T code, we expect that the reimbursement rate cut will be even more 


draconian than average, and is closer at hand than 2023. With respect to the magnitude of the 


reimbursement cut, we expect that the current $311 rate that CMS Contractor Novitas Solutions 


pays for 0297T in Houston (where iRhythm’s IDTF is not coincidentally located) will decline to 


the $150-200 range in a best case scenario, on par with the Category I reimbursement rate 


CMS confers upon cardiac Event Monitoring. Novitas accounts for the vast majority of iRhythm’s 


CMS revenue (in a classic case of contractor shopping, iRhythm originally located its diagnostic
Kerrisdale Capital Management, LLC | 1212 Avenue of the Americas, 3rd Floor | New York, NY 10036 | Tel: 212.792.7999 | Fax: 212.531.6153 4 





and testing facility in the region where it negotiated the most favorable reimbursement). In a 


worst case scenario, iRhythm could see the reimbursement rate for 0297T fall to $45-50, similar 


to a Holter monitor reimbursement rate, which is what the vast majority of CMS contractors 


reimburse for the code at the current time. Commercial payor reimbursement rates, which are 


typically more generous than Medicare reimbursement rates, tend to use the CMS fee schedule 


as a reference, and a drop in Medicare reimbursement generally presages a similar magnitude 


decline in commercial payor reimbursement. 





Regarding the timing of the transition to a Category I code, iRhythm competitor BioTelemetry 


Inc (BEAT) has stated that it wants the extended Holter procedures transitioned to a permanent 


Category I code as soon as practicable. While there is some specialty society politics that 


BioTel has to navigate in the course of getting its application to the CPT Editorial Panel, we 


would expect a 2019 application to be easily approved by the Panel in the current year, implying 


a 2021 implementation of the newly transitioned code and the inevitable reimbursement 


reduction. BioTelemetry’s extended Holter accounts for less than 5% of its total revenue, and 


based on conversations with industry participants, management is pushing for a Category I 


code to exert pressure on iRhythm, its newest competitor. BioTel has also been on the receiving 


end of a massive reimbursement cut on its MCT monitoring in the past and would like to clarify 


the long-term pricing for the product in order to assess its own strategic direction in the new 


vertical. 





Finally, even with no action from the AMA on CPT code changes, we expect that iRhythm’s 


extraordinary success in attaining coverage and favorable reimbursement rates from payors is 


in the process of backfiring. It’s worth noting that Category III codes are “contractor priced.” In 


other words, CMS does not set the price in its physician fee schedule, but each Medicare 


Administrative Contractor (MAC) sets or negotiates a price with the provider. iRhythm, with its 


IDTF in Houston performing all the scanning and reporting procedures, has benefited from the 


regional MAC – Novitas Solutions – generously reimbursing the Zio codes. No other MAC in the 


country reimburses for the procedure as generously, and most MACs have taken the view that 


not much differentiates the Zio from a traditional Holter monitor beyond the presence of some 


solid-state memory that can hold 14 days’ worth of heart rhythm data (~500MB). As such, in 39 


of 50 states, 0297T would be reimbursed at rates 33-89% lower than $311. 





While MACs don’t fiddle with pricing very much, we’ve found that large price changes tend to 


occur following abnormally large changes in procedure utilization. Our discussion with a former 


Novitas medical director who was involved in the original Zio reimbursement discussions 


confirmed that the MACs have analytics-based screens meant to flag procedures with 


abnormally large increases in utilization. Given the 300% cumulative increase in iRhythm’s 


revenues from CMS for the 3 years ending 2018 (3 year utilization changes being one of CMS’s 


primary triggers for review), we would expect that the alarm has already sounded at CMS or 


Novitas (or both) on a code that is being reimbursed disproportionately well compared to very 


similar procedures.

Any review of the code at the institutional level is likely to result in reimbursement coming down 


to a level closer to where the other MACs are. Additionally, Novitas’ contract for Jurisdiction H 


ends in June of this year. If any other contractor wins that contract, iRhythm is almost certain to 


lose its lush Medicare deal. And of course, commercial payors will follow. 





The competition is already beating iRhythm at its own game. The Zio XT is actually a fairly 


simple device: a sensor that detects cardiac rhythm, some memory, and a patch. As a former 


iRhythm regional sales manager told us, “you could literally go and find the building blocks in 


your garage and build it yourself if you’re a bit handy.” Until the last twelve months, though, 


there was no real competition for the device, as it had yet to gain traction with physicians until 


two years ago. But recently, a slew of competitors have launched extended Holters that 


compete with the Zio, and for the most part, they’re making improvements around the Zio’s 


weaknesses, including patch placement, number of sensors, time-to-reporting and rhythm-


recording clarity. 





To investors, iRhythm has defended its competitive position as unassailable given that the Zio is 


“better, proven, and complete.” But the literature it uses to show that the Zio is better than other 


monitoring modalities has now been replaced by literature employing the same testing 


methodologies but showing that competitors such as Bardy Diagnostics’ CAM patch are 


superior to the Zio on the same endpoints. And though iRhythm claims that its underlying AI 


tools perform better than expert cardiologists, a careful read of the clinical studies it promotes 


shows that the Zio’s diagnostic capabilities are in certain ways inferior to even the “low-tech” 


traditional Holter monitor that has been around since 1962.  





Finally, discussions with doctors at large hospital networks suggest that iRhythm’s one-size-fits-


all “complete” enterprise solution can be a competitive disadvantage. Zio customers are forced 


to use iRhythm’s IDTF for scanning and reporting, but many hospitals already employ their own 


ECG technicians, which makes paying for iRhythm’s scanning and analysis service inefficient 


and costly. New entrants such as Bardy have exploited this weakness by offering more 


accommodating software tools that allow larger institutions to have their already-employed 


technicians read and analyze the rhythm recordings. This has the added advantage much faster 


turnaround time, which aids both physician and hospital workflow.  





The Zio AT is a failure, leaving iRhythm as a single-product company with a TAM much 


smaller than it describes to investors. iRhythm’s portrayal of its current addressable market 


is a cardiac monitoring market encompassing approximately 4.5 million monitoring procedures 


annually, all of which can be addressed by either the Zio XT or the newer Zio AT. iRhythm, with 


just a “low double digit” percentage of that market at recent year-end, has a long way to go 


before its penetration will start to slow, or so iRhythm claims.

This narrative is misleading. The market for cardiac monitoring, excluding iRhythm, is trifurcated 


along approximately the following lines: 





Market Share, by volume, of Cardiac Monitoring Modalities 2018 
 








Source: CMS Provider Utilization and Payment Data, BioTelemetry Inc. Filings 


and Conference Call Commentary, Kerrisdale analysis 
 





Traditional Holter monitors occupy the low end of pricing but almost two thirds of volumes. 


Event Monitors are in the middle with ~20-25% of the volume. Meanwhile, mobile cardiac 


telemetry (MCT), the most expensive monitoring procedure, makes up ~10-15% of volumes. As 


we heard from several electrophysiologists, the Zio XT cannot reasonably compete with most 


Event Monitoring procedures and MCT, which make up about a third of the market. These 


procedures are typically prescribed by electrophysiologists who require real-time attended 


monitoring, high levels of rhythm-recording clarity, and/or minimal time-to-diagnosis. The Zio XT 


has no real-time capabilities and takes 3-4 weeks from the start of monitoring to get its report to 


the doctor. Due to its miniaturized design, it also necessarily skimps on recording clarity. As a 


result, we believe that at least a third, and potentially up to a half, of iRhythm’s claimed TAM is 


actually off-limits to the Zio XT. 





To address the inability of the XT to perform real-time monitoring, iRhythm introduced the Zio 


AT in mid-2017. The AT was originally billed by iRhythm as “our version of Mobile Cardiac 


Telemetry” meant to “serve patients who have more critical symptoms such as syncope, pre-


syncope and ventricular tachycardia.”1 But the AT has not lived up to iRhythm’s initial 


expectations, which foresaw a timeline of “3 to 4 quarters in order to get full AT contracts.” We 


were unable to find any physicians, at large hospital groups or otherwise, that were using the
