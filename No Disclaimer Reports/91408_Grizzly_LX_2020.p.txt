LX FXI(i-Share China Large Cap ETF)


R E P O R T S


We Believe LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: LX) 
is a Leverage Time Bomb About to Explode


• LX operates a high-interest rate online consumer lending
platform in China. We believe LX’s business model is deeply
�awed and set to collapse. Our target price is ZERO.


• The structure utilized by LX exposes its shareholders to
enormous losses by guaranteeing payment of loans while
putting Chinese lenders �rst. This strikes us as a quintessential
“Heads I win, tails you lose” situation for current shareholders.


• LX reports unfathomably low delinquency rates that
we simply do not trust. We believe LX is reporting
arti�cially low delinquency rates by essentially giving borrowers
who are already in default new funds to make payments. This has
led to a rapidly deteriorating credit quality.


• LX has historically charged Chinese consumers enormous
interest rates, often above the legal 36% usury rate. New regula-
tion in China will signi�cantly limit how much LX can charge to
15.4%, therefore putting the entire business model at risk.


• LX seems to be still actively engaged in direct peer-to-peer
lending, which the company supposedly already halted per
regulatory pressure. Other companies that have broken p2p
restrictions have mostly been shut down and executives were
even jailed.  We think LX could face similar regulatory pressure.


• The Corona Virus pandemic added insult to injury and the
consequent shut down of the economy has put a massive
number of consumers and consumer loans in default or delin-
quency.


• Several employees run businesses that are not disclosed by LX
as related parties. We identi�ed these businesses as service
providers or in the same �eld as LX. The opportunity to maneuver
costs and siphon o� money unbeknownst to investors and
auditors is troublesome to us.


• We also suspect that LX sold one business unbeknownst to
investors to the Chairman's relative.


• Giant misstatements in the past and weakness in �nancial
reporting we uncover in this report paint the picture of a compa-
ny whose �nancials can simply not be trusted.


• Our review of basic web tra�c analysis leads us to question if
the purported volume by LX is even real in the �rst place.


• Despite LX management touting its Tencent background, major
shareholders including JD.com are selling o�, showing a lack of
con�dence in LX’s future.


• Our valuation prices in the severe risks hidden from investors.
Upon adjustments, we believe the company should have seen an
equity decrease of RMB 1.85B. Ultimately, we believe the compa-
ny is not viable under new Chinese regulations.

Research report on LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: LX)


Background


Shenzhen Fenqile Network Technology Co., Ltd. 
(“Shenzhen Fenqile”), was established in China in 
August 2013 and began to operate Fenqile, an online 
consumer �nance platform, in October 2013. On 
Fenqile consumers can borrow money. In October 
2013, Beijing Lejiaxin Network Technology Co., Ltd. 
(“Beijing Lejiaxin”), was incorporated as an invest-
ment holding company in China and established its 
wholly-owned subsidiary Shenzhen Qianhai Juzi 
Information Technology Co., Ltd. (“Qianhai Juzi”) in 
June 2014, which operates the company’s online 
investment platform Juzi Licai. Juzi Licai is targeted at 
attracting institutional investors that want to invest in 
consumer loans. 


August 25th 2020


• Individual Investors on its Juzi Licai platform
• Institutional Funding Partners through Juzi Licai 
platform and direct lending program
• Investors of asset-backed securities


Source:  Company prospectus


The company’s online consumer �nance platform, 
Fenqile, o�ers customers personal installment loans, 
installment purchase loans, and other loan products. 
The platform also o�ers a wide range of products on 
its e-commerce channel and allows customers to 
utilize their credit lines to �nance their purchases. It 
matches customer loans with three main funding 
sources:


At �rst glance, investors might be impressed by the 
company’s growth in its loan origination (from 22.2 
Billion RMB in 2016 to 126.0 Billion RMB in 2019) and 
its top and bottom-line growth (revenues grew from 
4.3 Billion RMB in 2016 to 10.6 Billion RMB in 2019, 
with earnings per ADS of loss of 4.03 RMB in 2016 to 
pro�t of 12.29 RMB (~US$1.76) in 2019. However, 
upon a closer look, it becomes apparent why we 
believe LX is a ticking time bomb about to explode.

Civil Lending/Borrowing Interest Hurdle Rate Reform 
Means the End of LX’s Business Model
On July 22, 2020, China’s Supreme People’s Court 
(SPC) and National Development and Reform Com-
mission (NDRC) jointly issued a guideline on legal 
protection for the economy. Article 13 talks about the 
civil lending-borrowing interest rate and the govern-


ment’s intention to dramatically decrease the current 
up-limit interest rate that can be charged by the 
lenders. 


“统筹兼顾利率市场化改革与维护正常金融秩序的关系，对于借贷合同中一方主张的利息、复
利、罚息、违约金和其他费用总和超出司法保护上限的，不予支持。……抓紧修改完善关于审
理民间借贷案件适用法律问题的司法解释，大幅度降低民间借贷利率的司法保护上限，坚决否
定高利转贷行为、违法放贷行为的效力，维护金融市场秩序，服务实体经济发展。”


“Coordinate the relationship between interest rate market reform and normal �nancial order protec-
tion, do not support the counterparty in a lending-borrowing contract whose aggregate interest 
rate including interest payment, compounding interest, penalty, default fees, and other fees that 
exceeds the law-protected up-limit interest rate……Amend the justice explanation of lawsuits 
involving lending-borrowing civil cases, to dramatically decrease the legal protection of the up-limit 
of civil lending-borrowing interest rate, decisively denying the high-interest rate loan transfer 
activity and illegal lending activity, to protect the �nancial market’s order and service the real 
economy’s development.”


The Supreme People’s Court set 24% as the legally 
protected up-limit of the interest rate in the civil 
lending-borrowing cases, meaning if the agreed 
interest rate is lower than 24%, the court should 
support the lender when the lender requests borrower 


to pay interest under the contract. It was also report-
ed that the up-limit protected interest rate could be 4 
times of the one year LPR (Loan Prime Rate). 


“有知情人士向21世纪经济报道记者表示，今年春节前后最高法就在酝酿修改民间借贷的司法
解释，相对于之前的24%、36%划分两道“红线”的做法，主流的意见是设定一个民间借贷利率
保护上限，这个上限有专家建议参考之前一年期利率的4倍，现在可以参考央行LPR报价的四倍
。”


“Certain personnel familiar with this matter told the reporter from 21st Century Business Herald that 
around this year’s Spring Festival the Supreme People’s Court has already been under consideration 
of amending the justice explanation of civil lending-borrowing, in contrast to the previous 24% and 
36% two red lines for the interest rate, the mainstream opinion is to set an up-limit protected civil 
lending-borrowing interest rate, and some expert suggest this up-limit rate should be 4 times of the 
previous one-year base interest rate, now people can refer the 4 times of Central Bank’s LPR pricing. ”

R E P O R T S


Civil Lending/Borrowing Interest Hurdle Rate Reform 
Means the End of LX’s Business Model (Cont’d)
On August 2020, China’s Supreme People’s Court 
(SPC) issued a press release confirming the imple-
mentation of the 4x LPR upper limit. According  to 
July 2020 data, this would indicate an uppler limit of 
15.4%. As of Q2 2020, LX averages 26.5%. 
SPC further stipulates that fees charged in forms 
other than interest need also be less than 4x LPR. In 


essence, the summation of all fees charged related to 
a loan will need to conform to the 4x LPR limit. This 
means LX will not be able to work around this issue by 
recategorizing interest payments as other forms of 
fees.


The upper limit of judicial protection for private lending rates is determined based on the 
standard of 4 times the one-year Loan Prime Rate (LPR) issued by the National Interbank 
Funding Center authorized by the National Interbank Funding Center of the People's Bank of 
China on the 20th of each month, replacing the original regulations of 24% and 36% two 
rates and three-zone regulations greatly reduce the upper limit of judicial protection for 
private lending rates, and promote private lending rates to gradually adapt to the actual 
level of China's economic and social development.


That is, the lender and the borrower have agreed not only on the overdue interest rate, but 
also liquidated damages or other costs. The lender can choose to claim overdue interest, 
liquidated damages or other costs, or both. However, the people’s court will not support the 
portion that exceeds the 4 times LPR limit.

R E P O R T S


Civil Lending/Borrowing Interest Hurdle Rate Reform 
Means the End of LX’s Business Model (Cont’d)
What Does This Mean For LX?
LX currently averages an APR of 26.5%, which is 
already higher than the previously supported rate. 
However, new regulations would further decrease the 
upper limit to 15.4%. 


If LX were to apply this 15.4% as its APR, we do 
not believe LX is viable anymore. According to our 
model, LX would have negative net income and 
negative book value of equity.    


Therefore, we believe this jointly issued Guideline is 
an existential risk for consumer lending/P2P platforms 
such as LX. LX’s business model would simply cease to 
make sense once the upper-limit interest rate change 
is implemented. We therefore give LX a target price 
of ZERO.

R E P O R T S


Civil Lending/Borrowing Interest Hurdle Rate Reform 
Means the End of LX’s Business Model (Cont’d)
But Sell-Side Said This Could Be Good?
On August 20th, the day when the o�cial decrease of usury rate to 15.4% was announced, headlines and 
sell-side commentary were quick to conclude that the announcement would actually have positive implications 
for Chinese Fintech companies and licensed lenders such as LX. We believe these statements to be categorically 
false and hugely misleading.


First of all, we did not �nd any indications that �ntech platforms are exempt from this regulation. We also believe 
LX does not fall under the licensed lender category, as those are typically reserved for banks. 


“...no impact on major �ntech platforms or licensed consumer credit providers, in our view. ” 
--- Jacky Zuo, China Renaissance Securities 


Secondly, the goal of the new rule is to lower credit cost for the whole society. Contrary to what Sell-side claims, 
it is widely acknowledged that following the reduction of unlicensed lenders’ interest rates will have a profound 
e�ect on the whole credit industry. We have seen this back in 2015 and again today in 2020. An article on Xinhua 
Net helps explain the full-on e�ect of the decision. 


Thirdly, we compared word by word the 2015 and 2020 rules, and note that the exact same words were used to 
describe the scope of the e�ect. The 2015 interest rate changes which set the upper limit to be 36% had a wide 
e�ect on all �nancial institutions. We also see LX complying to the 2015 rules. There is no reason why the 2015 
iteration would apply to LX where the 2020 version would not. 


In any case, we don’t see a scenario where Chinese regulators ignore and allow LX to continue charging predato-
ry lending rates.


2015 Iteration 2020 Iteration


Translation:
These Provisions are not applicable to �nancial institutions and their branches established 
with the approval of the �nancial regulatory authorities to engage in loan business and 
disputes arising from the issuance of loans and other related �nancial businesses


Although the "Regulations" make it clear that the scope of private lending does not include "�nancial 
institutions whose loan business is a business", industry insiders said that taking into account actual 
operating conditions, this "Regulations" may still have a large impact on �nancial institutions.


"The general consensus is that licensed �nancial institutions cannot charge surpass usury rates. There-
fore, we see that nominal lending rates for bank credit cards, consumer �nance companies, etc. are also 
set just below the upper limit of judicial protection of private lending rates." 


---Chen Wen, director of the Digital Economy Research Center of the School of 
Finance of the University of Finance and Economics

Stock Price and Earnings Q&A Signals Negative E�ects


The stock price performance on the heels of earnings report was dumbfounding to say the least. With revenue beat and only slight earnings miss, the 
stock was down almost 15% in the following two days. We suspect people familiar with the hurdle rate reform already began selling-o� on rumors of 
decision being reached. Had the decision been truly bene�cial to LX, the opposite likely would have happened. 


Contrary to consensus, we believe the decision to reform the hurdle rates was actually reached on August 18th, 2 
days before the o�cial announcement. In fact, it is not unreasonable to assume the decision was already

Civil Lending/Borrowing Interest Hurdle Rate Reform 
Means the End of LX’s Business Model (Cont’d)
Stock Price and Earnings Q&A Signals Negative E�ects
We assume the following two scenarios. 


Scenario 1: LX Management Knew the Outcome of the Decision
Assuming management knew the outcome of the decision, their response to the analyst would seem dodgy at 
best, and pessimistic about its e�ect on LX’s current services. If the ruling were in favor of LX, we believe man-
agement would have been much more con�dent and o�ered a much stronger response. 


Scenario 2: LX Management Unaware of the Outcome of the Decision
Assuming management did not know the outcome of the decision, their response would still indicate that they 
will su�er as opposed to thrive under the new regulations. Even they acknowledge that they will likely see at 
least 10% reduction in service fees or revenues. Although we believe the ultimate e�ect is much more devastat-
ing, we side with management in that this is all-together bad news for them.


Therefore, we strongly disagree with the prevailing sell-side commentary and believe that the Hurdle Rate 
Reform will be a hurdle LX cannot pass.

LX Accumulated a Giant O�-Balance Sheet Loan Book 
that Looks Highly Toxic to Us 


August 25th 2020


Since 2018, LX has been shifting to o�-balance sheet loans by facilitating loans between its customers and 
institutional funding partners. This is the main driver of the company’s revenue growth in the past two years.


(in RMB’000, except for number of users) 2016 2017 2018 2019 


Outstanding principal balance (in millions) 9,899 19,272 32,397 60,567 


 Outstanding principal balance by accoun�ng treatment: 


Outstanding principal balance of on-balance sheet loans (in millions) 7,712 12,012 6,808 4,785 


Outstanding principal balance of off-balance sheet loans (in millions) 2,187 7,260 25,589 55,782 


Outstanding principal balance by type of loan product: 


Outstanding principal balance of installment purchase loans (in millions) 2,106 1,677 1,570 2,365 


Outstanding principal balance of personal installment loans (in millions) 7,793 17,595 30,827 58,202 


This is due to overall regulatory pressure on peer to 
peer (p2p) lending. Since 2015, the Chinese govern-
ment has been adjusting regulations and enforcing 
more stringent oversight over p2p lending due to the 
high-risk nature of the business. By the end of 2018 
and early 2019, a document called “Opinions on the 
correct Classified Disposal and Risk Prevention of 
Online Lending Institutions关于做好网贷机构分类
处置和风险防范工作的意见”, more commonly 
known as document 175, outlined the general trend 
of companies exiting the entire p2p industry. We 
believe LX made the recent structural changes to 
comply with regulatory changes.


1. O�-balance sheet loans demonstrate high risk pro�le
2. Despite what the name suggests, equity investors are
ultimately liable for the performance of these loans


While we applaud the company for taking measures 
to seem more compliant with relevant regulations, 
two issues deem scrutiny:


We believe the increase in the o�-balance sheet loans 
outstanding makes it hard for investors to gauge what 
kind of risks are associated with these loans. Although 
the risk pro�le of the on-balance-sheet loans might 
not be the same for the o�-balance sheet loans, we 
believe it is a good proxy for investors to get a general 
idea of how the risk pro�le has shifted in the last two 
years.


2016 2017 2,018 2,019 2016 2017 2,018 2,019 


Risk level: 


A 2,575,784 3,078,483 1,544,637 996,524 33.4% 25.6% 22.7% 20.8% 


B 1,296,013 2,235,552 1,502,681 1,023,490 16.8% 18.6% 22.1% 21.4% 


C 2,455,076 2,890,202 1,447,785 661,688 31.8% 24.1% 21.3% 13.8% 


D 892,322 2,714,510 1,359,982 856,633 11.6% 22.6% 20.0% 17.9% 


E 206,164 807,290 308,528 625,700 2.7% 6.7% 4.5% 13.1% 


F 67,973 170,335 318,276 399,073 0.9% 1.4% 4.7% 8.3% 


N and others 218,540 116,078 325,817 221,925 2.8% 1.0% 4.8% 4.6% 


Total 7,711,872 12,012,450 6,807,706 4,785,033 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 100.0% 


Above is the table that summarizes the company’s 
net record investment of the �nancing receivables, by 
credit quality indicator, from 2016 to 2019. 


It is evident that the percentage of loans from risk 
levels D and below increased dramatically from 2016 
to 2019. To put into perspective, the total percentage 
of loans from risk levels D, E, F and N and others 


increased from 18.0% in 2016 to 44.0% in 2019. 


Typically, it would make sense for the company to put 
relatively better loans in terms of risk on its own 
balance sheet and put the loans that are riskier o� its 
balance sheet. Thus, it is reasonable to assume the risk 
pro�le of the loans that are o�-balance sheet is as least 
as bad as what is shown on its balance sheet. 


note: per company’s �ling, the key factors we consider in determining the credit risk level of each customer include: 1) Geographic location, for example, 
whether the customer is located in a �rst-tier, second-tier or third-tier city, and the level of economic development of the relevant city; 2) Education 
background, i.e., the customer's academic degree and past or current education institutions; 3) Level of income; 4) Outstanding loans from other external 
sources, such as credit card issuers and other consumer �nance platforms; and 5) External credit references. Risk Level A has the highest credit rank.

Worse Yet, LX Shareholders Are Guaranteeing the Performance of These Toxic Loans.


August 25th 2020


LX Accumulated a Giant O�-Balance Sheet Loan Book 
that Looks Highly Toxic to Us (Cont’d) 


We believe LX’s business model is widely misunderstood. Investors seem to be largely unaware that, even if the 
majority of the company’s loans outstanding are o�-balance sheet, it still needs to provide protection for a lot of 
these loans. 


• For the o�-balance sheet loans funded by the individual investors on Juzi Licai, LX provides a risk safeguard
scheme to the individual investors and records the obligations associated with the RSS in accordance with ASC 460,
Guarantees.
• For the o�-balance sheet loans funded by certain Institutional Funding Partners, LX provides deposits and
replenishes such deposits from time to time to the institutional funding partners by directly compensating them
for principal and interest payment in the event of the borrowers’ defaults, which are accounted for as guarantee
liabilities under ASC 460, Guarantees, provided that the scope exception under ASC 815-10-15-58 is met.


Accounting Standards Codi�cation (ASC) 460, Guarantees, 
requires that the fair value of guarantees be recognized as a 
liability, and establishes the notion that a guarantee actually 
consists of two distinct components. These two obligations 
have quite di�erent accounting implications: noncontingent 
obligation; and contingent obligation. The �rst of these 
components is a noncontingent obligation, namely, the 
obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the 
guarantee in the event that the speci�ed triggering events or 
conditions occur. This stand-ready obligation is unconditional 
and thus is not considered a contingent obligation. The second 
component, which is a contingent obligation, is the obligation 
to make future payments if those triggering events or 
conditions occur.


For a �nancial guarantee contract to meet the scope exception 
of ASC 815-10-15-58, the contract must:
1. Provide for payments to be made solely to reimburse the 
guaranteed party for failure of the debtor to satisfy its required 
payment obligations
2. Provide payment only if the debtor’s obligation is past due
3. Provide payment only if the guaranteed party is exposed 
to the risk of nonpayment at inception of the guarantee 
arrangement and throughout its life


O�-Balance Sheet Loans Funded by Individual Investors
O�-balance sheet loans on the Juzi Licai platform 
went through a structural change in late April 2018. 
The previous model was referred to as the Old Model. 
The New Model positions LX as the intermediary 
between Borrower and Individual Investors. In terms 
of protection for loans:


Under the New Model, the Group entered into a coopera-
tion agreement with an independent third-party guaran-
tee company (the “Guarantee Company”), to set up a new 
investor protection program called the Risk Safeguard 
Scheme (“RSS”). The purpose of the RSS is to provide 
make-up payments to the Individual Investors on Juzi 
Licai when the Borrowers default. The RSS only applies 
to loans newly funded under the New Model and 
requires the Borrowers to contribute to the RSS to protect 
the Individual Investors. By default, all Borrowers enroll in 
the RSS when the Underlying Loan Agreements are 
entered into.


However, the Juzi Licai’s old model is not covered by 
such RSS. Rather they are protected by the quality 
assurance program that ceased operation in April 
2018.  


As of �scal year end of 2019, there are still over RMB 
821.4M are still outstanding from the old model. This 
is disturbing in two aspects:


1. Since the old model halted on April 24th, 2018,
why is there such a large balance by the end of
2019?


2. Who o�ers protection for the default of such
loans? They should be largely overdue right?
According to company disclosure, loans delinquent
for over 90 days are 1.56%, amounting to around
945M. We have reason to believe RMB 821.4M
belongs to the old model that is unprotected.  This
is a huge red �ag

O�-Balance Sheet Loans Funded by Institutional Funding Partners
LX sources the majority of its funds through institu-
tional funding partners. Wall Street and investors have 
applauded the company for this structural funding 
change and have allocated a higher valuation to the 
company. However, we believe the general perception 


Starting from 2019, the Group started to cooperate with third-party insurance companies and guarantee companies that 
directly provide guarantee services to certain Institutional Funding Partners, and no longer replenished the deposits 
made to these Institutional Funding Partners. According to relevant �nancial guarantee arrangements, third-party 
insurance companies and guarantee companies will provide the principal and interest payment to these Institutional 
Funding Partners, in case of Borrowers' defaults. However, the Group is required to provide deposits and replenish such 
deposits from time to time to the bank accounts of these insurance companies and guarantee companies, in the event 
that such insurance companies and guarantee companies perform their guarantee obligations upon the Borrowers' 
defaults. E�ectively, the Group provides back-to-back guarantee to the insurance companies and guarantee 
companies and takes on all of the credit risk of the Borrowers.


Sophisticated verbiage aside, their RSS program is a 
limited liability account that only pays out investors the 
maximum amount in the RSS program, whereas 
guarantees for institutional investors take on all credit 
risks of borrowers. Essentially, under mass default, all 
company assets and shareholder equity are fair game 
as repayment measures. As of December 2019, the 
company has close to $8 billion in outstanding princi-
pal from o�-balance sheet loans. However, the compa-
ny only holds $179 million in deposits to insurance 
companies and guarantee companies, which is merely 
2.2% of the total outstanding balance. This is even 
insu�cient to cover the ~3% default rate disclosed by 
the company, not to mention the undisclosed, or 
hidden portion of the defaults. 


In essence, LX is under-reserving for a liability that they 
are 100% responsible for. 


of the potential riskiness of the loans is largely 
misguided. We believe these loans are even riskier 
than individual investor loans. Per 2019 20F, the 
company discusses that they have guarantees for 
institutional funding partners:


To give you an idea how fragile LX’s balance sheet is, 
consider the restatement that occurred in Q1 2020. 
The FASB issued amended guidance related to impair-
ment of �nancial instruments as part of ASU No. 
2016-13, Financial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 
326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial 
Instruments, which became e�ective January 1, 2020.
The implementation of this new accounting guidance 
wiped out 0.3B RMB, or 5% of LX’s shareholder equity 
on its balance sheet. Shareholder equity is a common 
metric to value subprime lenders, and we are surprised 
the signi�cant development has gone seemingly 
unnoticed.


Worse Yet, LX Shareholders Are Guaranteeing the Performance of These Toxic Loans.


E�ectively, the Group provides back-to-back guarantee to the insurance 
companies and guarantee companies and takes on all of the credit risk of the 
Borrowers.

LX Accumulated a Giant O�-Balance Sheet Loan Book 
that Looks Highly Toxic to Us  (Cont’d)
Timeliness: Why we believe the Scheme is about to Fall Apart
We believe that LX’s structure has exposed shareholders to giant o�-balance sheet liabilities while protecting 
Chinese institutional investors. While in good times big leverage might work in your favor, it also exposes you to 
greater risk when the going gets rough. We believe the time has come for LX’s scheme to unfold and it is only a 
question of time until the company must restructure or wipe out shareholders. Our belief is based on four key 
insights:


1. Recent guidelines issued by SPC and NDRC put signi�cant downward pressure on the future usury hurdle. Under the
newly proposed interest rate, LX’s business will see a signi�cant decrease in pro�ts, if not a complete wipeout of
business.
2. LX is essentially targeting low credit quality consumers in China. Even under current interest hurdle rates, LX’s
consumer lending platform seems to be predatory. There are countless complaints about usurious interest rates (36% apr
is usury hurdle in China) and predatory collection practices. These consumers are likely unable to obtain credit from
traditional �nancing methods.
3. The Corona Virus has forced many Chinese borrowers into delinquency. We believe the recent delinquency rates LX
reports seem way too low and are utterly untrustworthy. This e�ect should disproportionally a�ect low-quality borrow-
ers who are willing to pay the excessive interest rates LX charges.
4. We observed that LX seems to extend and restructure loans to give the appearance of performance and
current-ness of old loans where the borrower is actually delinquent or in default.


Additionally, we have evidence that makes us strongly doubt the integrity of the �nancial statements in general 
and the legality of certain business practices in particular:


- LX seems to be still facilitating direct peer to peer lending, which is generally
outlawed as illegal in China.
- Several employees of LX operate companies in the similar business as LX. We
suspect these undisclosed related parties are used to in�ate �nancials and conduct
borderline illegal activities such as direct peer-to-peer lending and aggressive debt
collections.
- Big restatements of past �nancials cast doubt on the integrity of �nancial
statements.
- Insiders are selling shares, and pocketing unordinary high compensations.

LX Continues to Sell P2P Products Despite Publicly 
Stating Otherwise 


R E P O R T S


“Given the increasingly tightening trend of restrictions on online consumer �nancing, we have gradually shifted our 
business model away from individual funding and further diversi�ed our funding sources in 2019 in line with regulatory 
guidance. We have ceased facilitating new loans with funding from individual investors on Juzi Licai platform 
since November 2019. “ --- LX 20F


Despite what the company claimed, we discovered 
that LX is blatantly lying to the government and 
investors, and are continuing to o�er P2P products 
on its Juzi Licai app (LX’s P2P Mobile App). We are 
also quite amazed at how auditors neglected a red 
�ag that was so easy to identify. All they had to do
was to download the application and look at the
product o�erings. As of the date of this report, LX’s
Juzi Licai is still o�ering 8 products with interests
ranging from 5% to over 10%.  The products are
sold daily at 10am every day.


A variety of products are o�ered everyday at 10:00 Beijing 
Time. 


Each product has a detailed breakdown of the related 
transaction personnel involved, including whose loan 
was matched with whose money. 


For example, in this case, on July 8th, a person 
Surnamed Rong borrowed RMB 90,000 and received 
loans from over 2818 lenders. 


Even as of today, we still see cases where peer loans 
are matched with peer lenders on the Juzi Licai 
platform, in the typical P2P �nance fashion. 


It is mind-boggling that LX continues to sell P2P 
products under the current stringent regulatory 
environment. We believe this could cause a big back-
lash once the regulator determines to take action on 
this activity.

LX Continues to Sell P2P Products Despite Publicly 
Stating Otherwise (Cont’d)


R E P O R T S


It seems LX is in clear violation of the current regula-
tion from the city of Shenzhen, Guangdong Prov-
ince. According to a media report, on December 7, 
2018, the Shenzhen Internet Finance Association (a 


self-regulating body backed by the local government) 
issued a notice that put additional strict rules on the 
P2P sector.


It was reported that as of January 2020 already 203 P2P platforms have phased out of this peer-to-peer lending 
business. It seems the trend is continuing. As recently as April and May, two big-scale P2P platforms have 
announced a gradual phase-out of the P2P business. These two companies located in the city of Shenzhen, 
where LX’s P2P platform Juzi Licai is also headquartered. 


• In Feb 2019, the Chinese government confirmed it had frozen $1.5billion in assets from unscrupu-
lous P2P lenders and around 100 executives are under investigation. Thousands of platforms have 
gone bust or just disappeared over the past two years.
• In April 2020, a P2P platform called Suishouji (随手记) issued a notice stating that it will gradually 
conduct business closure and get out of the P2P business. It is reported that the balance of outstand-
ing loans on its platform was RMB 2.6 Billion as of March 31, 2020, with 80,793 individual lenders.
• In May 2020, a P2P platform called Xiaoniu Zaixian (小牛在线), one of the biggest P2P platforms in 
Guangdong Province, announced the gradual phase-out of the P2P business. According to its website, 
the balance of outstanding loans on its platform was RMB 10.4 Billion with 115,790 individual inves-
tors.


In the past few years, countless P2P platforms have been busted which resulted in manage-
ment arrest/civil lawsuits/regulatory shut-down. LX is danger of facing the same fate.

Fenqile Lending Platform Seems Highly Predatory 


August 25th 2020


We looked into Fenqile and found that it targets very 
low credit consumers and often charges interest rates 
over the legal usury rate in China, which is 36% p.a. 
Additionally, the company seems to bully lenders on 
the platform with harassing phone calls, and sudden 
increases in principal. These practices are more 
reminiscent of loan sharks than a credible lending 
operation. 


Example 1: https://ts.21cn.com/tousu/show/id/2305472


“……而欠款额度到达三万多的时候是2018年到2020年期间，就算这两年借满三万五，一年利
息按24%算，一年7200，两年也才14400，加上2018年以前的年利息算6000，总的也才两万左右
利息啊，现在还要我还出四万五，也就是这几年的本金还清了，借款三万多，这两年的利息就
是四万五，其利息高出法律红线，是高利贷中的高利贷，期间多次跟分期乐客服沟通，都说后
期联系我，但是一直没联系，现在也逾期了，如果本人征信受到影响，必将拿起法律逾期保护
自身权益……”


“The borrowing amount reached RMB 30,000 plus between 2018 and 2020, and even if [I] borrowed 
RMB 35,000, and based on an annual interest rate of 24%, 1 year [I will have to pay] RMB 7,200, and it 
will be RMB 14,400 for two years. Adding the total annual interest payable of RMB 6,000 before 2018, 
the total interest [for me to pay] should only be about RMB 20,000. Now [Fenqile] is asking me to pay 
RMB 45,000, which means even if the principal of RMB 30,000 plus is paid o� during these years, but 
the interest [on this principle] is RMB 45,000. This interest rate is much higher than the law-al-
lowed red line, and it is usury of the usuries. During this period [I have] communicated with 
Fenqile’s customer service and then they told me they would contact me, but they didn’t. Now I am 
in delinquency, and if my credit is negatively a�ected, I will rely on the law to protect my rights…”


In this case, the person complained that he/she is receiving over 60% annualized interest rate on his/her princi-
pal. 


Example 2: https://ts.21cn.com/tousu/show/id/2306531


“……16年中旬亲戚用我的名义借款30000元，实际到账30000元，期间亲戚承诺还款，但一直
分期或者最低还款，现还款金额达到15000元，期间催收电话进行通讯爆破，本人才得知真相，
直至今日需还账单涨到50000元，我认为分期乐属于高利贷，以分期手续费名义进行乱收费，利
滚利，现本人需要和分期乐协商退还手续费，重新规划债务……”


“In the middle of 2016, one relative used my name to borrow RMB 30,000, and the actual borrowing 
[from Fenqile] is RMB 30,000. During this period my relative promised to pay it back, but he/she only 
paid in installments or minimum payback, and until now the total payback reached RMB 15,000. 
During this period, the debt collection parties phoned many of the contacts on my phone, and then 
I realized that the current balance payable increased to RMB 50,000. I believe Fenqile belongs to 
usury, and it collects fees and uses the interest to grow interest under the name of installment 
fees. Now I need to negotiate with Fenqile to give me back the fees and reorganize the debt.”


There are many complaints online that allege Fenqile’s 
APR is over 36%. For example, on one of the main 
consumer complaining site, https://ts.21cn.com/ (聚
投诉), numerous complaints are alleging Fenqile has 
been charging higher than 36% on the loans the 
company lends out.

“……外包催收直接打爆通讯录，打到公司，导致我现在被公司准备辞退，协商分期付款，不
同意，一直不停的爆通讯录。……”


“The outsourced loan collection company called many people in my contact list, even to my compa-
ny. I have now been laid o� due to this. I tried to negotiate an installment but they didn’t agree 
and continued to aggressively call everyone on my contact list.…”


Example 4: https://ts.21cn.com/tousu/show/id/2305293


“分期乐平台再4月24日给我发送一封律师函件，当时我加了联系人微信。告知对方款项已经还
清，并且我征信报告和支付宝上面也没有记录。对方让我登陆分期乐账户，但是我登陆不了。
由于上班原因要晚上8点才下班。客服电话我也联系不了。在这期间联系家人告知有欠款事情，
老母亲已经马上60岁了，身体一直不好，听其消息整个人由于雷劈，身体受到严重伤害。其父
亲也一同受到伤害，并且打的是我父亲新的手机号码，不知道对方在何地用何种方法窃取到的
。现要求分期乐致电家人道歉并提供录音，对家人造成的影响做出赔偿”


“Fenqile sent me a lawyer letter on April 24th, I immediately added their WeChat account. I told 
them I repaid the money already. In addition, my credit report and Alipay account both do not have 
a record of loans outstanding. The other party asked me to log into Fenqile, but I couldn’t. Due to 
work, I couldn’t get o� until 8 pm and couldn’t reach out to customer service as well. During this 
period, they contacted my family and told them about the loan issue. My mother is almost 60 
years old and has always been in poor health. Upon hearing the news, she was shocked and su�ered 
health injuries. My father was injured as well. They also managed to call my father’s new number. I 
don’t know how they got that in the �rst place. I now demand Fenqile record an apology to my 
family and compensate my family accordingly.  ”


Additionally, we also saw countless complaints regarding the collection policy. These malpractices are borderline 
reckless, harassments, and illegal. Many of these malpractices include contacting the borrower’s friends and 
family to pressure repayment. Note that in China it is illegal to disclose personal loan information to third party 
without consent of the debtor.

Employees of LX Has Been Holding Equity Interest in Companies that Are Undis-
closed by LX as Subsidiaries


Source:  Qichacha


During the research, we identi�ed at least �ve 
companies that are owned by individuals who we 
believe are related to LX. 


We obtained SAIC �ling on the above companies 
and discovered that only Beihai Jiguang had 
meaningful �nancials. The company generated 
52m RMB in revenue in 2018, of which close to 
20M RMB were from loan collection services 
provided most likely to LX. (Note that there were 
no costs associated with the additional 20M 
revenue.) It’s as if the company gave this money to 
Beihai Jiguang for free. 


The parent company Beihai Caidan lists www.my-
caidan.com as their official website. The website is no 
longer functional as of the date of this report. Howev-
er, wayback archive suggests that the website previ-
ously hosted MMM Finance (MMM互助金融平台). In 
2016, Chinese Central Bank warned investors to not 
participate in MMM Finance. Due to the website’s 
previous involvement in MMM Finance, we do not 
believe this related party to be a credible company. We 
suspect this is one of the reasons why the company 
was not disclosed as a related party.

With the employee being legal representative and combined 75% equity interest of Beihai Caidan (along with its

We Suspect LX Sold a Business Unbeknownst to Investors to the Chairman’s Relative 


According to the SAIC information, Ji’an Microcre-
dit was established on December 2, 2016, and it
was 100% owned by one of LX’s subsidiaries until
 May 8, 2019, when a company called Jiangxi
Leyu Technology Co., Ltd. (江西乐誉融科技有
限公司, “Jiangxi Leyu”) became a 34% shareholder.
There is limited information on Jiangxi Leyu, but
we also found that there is another company 
called吉安奥聚讯信息咨询服务有限公司 (Ji’an 
Aojuxun Information Consulting Services Co., Ltd. 
“Ji’an Aojuxun”), which shares the same phone 
number (15079604902), email address
(1913425305@qq.com), and both of the compa-
nies are on the 7th �oor of the same building. 


Ji’an Aojuxun is 80% owned by an individual 
named XIAO Wenjuan, whose name is very similar 
to LX’s Chairman and CEO, XIAO Wenjie. We 
strongly suspect this individual to be in fact the 
chairman's sister, and act as a proxy on his behalf. 


If true, this constitutes a clear violation of SEC 
disclosure guideline. 


We suspect the reason why XIAO Wenjuan (relat-
ed to XIAO Wenjie) wants to control Ji’an Micro-
credit  is that the microcredit lending business 
has a much lower regulatory risk. In November 
2019, the National Fintech Risk Regulators issued 
a notice that guides P2P companies to transforms 
to become microcredit lending companies. That 
means microcredit lending business, in regulator’s 
views, is a lower risk sector than the P2P sector, 
and it appears to us that XIAO Wenjuan’s move in 
May 2019 is to take advantage of this regulatory 
trend in advance.


We question why the management failed to 
disclose this transaction at the time. Was it due to 
favorable prices? Was it due to the family connec-
tion? We suspect both!

Terrible Macro Trends: The Chinese Low Credit Consumer 
has had a Tough Period During The Quarantine
The overall banking sector in China has taken a 
heavy blow due to COVID, and the vast economic 
e�ects continue to show. 


"Consumer default rates at some banks have already increased to as high as 4% from about 
1% before the outbreak, according to Zhao Jian, head of Atlantis Financial Research, who cited a 
survey of lenders. An executive at one major Chinese bank said his �rm is taking steps to tighten 
credit card loans or even drop some clients after seeing a rapid increase in overdue payments." 
---The Economic Times


“Meanwhile, multiple local banks told the FT their overdue personal loan ratio had surged by as 
much as 60 percent from January, when the disease broke out….China Merchants Bank Co., paused 
on its credit-card business in March after a signi�cant increase in past-due loans.” ---Financial Times


“The lending campaign, however, has raised concerns about credit risks because defaults have also 
taken o�. Zhou Lifeng, chief risk o�cer at Hangzhou-based Sunyard Fintech, a consultancy that 
advises banks on risk management, said his clients had seen an increase of between 20 percent 
and 50 percent in non-performing consumer loans since the disease emerged.”  ---Financial Times


The situation unfortunately prolonged even when Covid in China was steadily put under control. The borrowers 
are still fundamentally in a bad place. 


“As of June 2020, Chinese bank’s delinquent loan rate is 2.1%, even higher than during the �rst 
quarter. Regulators are even more worried that the current numbers do not fully re�ect the 
underlying risks due to a number of policies put out such as extending loans, borrowing new ones 
to repay old etc.”  ---Sina Finance


Similarly, in the online �nancing sector, which is 
typically considered to be targeting subprime 
borrowers who could not secure �nancing from 
lower interest rate channels such as banks and 
other traditional �nancial institution, the situation 
has been consistently dire. 
Qudian Inc., (NYSE: QD) has seen its delinquency 
ratio jump to 20% in February from 13% at the end 
of last year. 


Multiple media outlets have touched upon the massive 
headwind to the credit industry in China during the 
coronavirus. 


Notice that borrowers and users under LX are typical-
ly considered sub-prime and high-risk borrowers by 
any traditional bank standards. Most probably turned 
to LX services after failing to acquire the desired loan 
from a bank. If the situation banks present is this dire, 
we worry the risks LX is facing is even a lot worse.

We Believe the Company is Masquerading Deteriorating 
Credit Quality


22


We believe LX has arti�cially de�ated its default and 
delinquency ratio to give the appearance of a more 
healthy �nancial position. 


We believe the LX has been arti�cially increasing 
the maturity of the loans upon default through a 
feature called “再分期”, installment on installment 
and “最低还款服务”, minimum payment. To put this 
into perspective, this is equivalent to when your 
minimum credit card payment comes due this 


month, the company gives another extension to your 
minimum payment and treat it as a new credit loan. 
According to LX users, LX has recently been extending 
the maturity of their loans on the second day after they 
become delinquent. We believe the company has been 
secretly doing so for a long time.


One user applied for this extension on the third day of 
becoming delinquent. His loan balance suddenly spread 
out over 12 months. 


This feature has been implemented by LX since 
2016. However, it was only used on loans that 
weren’t delinquent. Now, most likely due to 
e�ects of COVID-19, the company has deployed 
this tactic on delinquent loans to generate a 
seemingly healthy loan portfolio. The users don’t 
have to pay back the amount immediately and the 
company no longer has to book delinquencies. 


In reality, we believe what is happening under the 
black box that no investors, no lenders can see is 
the following. 


Suppose $1M of loans issued in Jan 2019 becomes 
due 12 months later on Jan 2020 and only very few 
borrowers are able to make payment. Instead of 


directly charging the entire balance of 1M+ delinquent 
loans, LX “vets” its borrowers and chooses to either 
o�er them “installment on installment” or “minimum
payment”. Those who do not receive such services are
accounted for as delinquent borrowers, but the
company wants to keep this number to a minimum.
However, those who receive such options, their delin-
quent loans are essentially packaged into another
product that is sold to lenders (investors). The
proceeds are then used by the borrowers to pay back
delinquent loans, thus reducing delinquency rates. We
believe the black box is so elaborately set up that even
institutional investors and insurance companies are
not fully aware. As long as the company can solicit
more funding from investors the Ponzi scheme keeps
rolling.


Three days overdue, delinquent fee ￥7.51
Loan Installment suceeded, generating payment
schedule, please pay on time


Source: https://m.wdzj.com/intelligence/70422.html


We spoke to numerous sell-side analysts who also casted doubt on how LX was able to maintain such low default and 
delinquency data. They suspected loan extensions but weren’t able to obtain evidence. We now provide proof that 


delinquent loans were in fact extended/renewed.

We Believe the Company is Masquerading Deteriorating 
Credit Quality (Cont’d)
However, there are some symptoms we can expect 
from this scheme. 


Source:  Company �lings


We can expect an overall increase in APR due to higher interest expenses 
charged on supposedly delinquent loans


Note that in China, the legal upper limit of interest 
rate is separated into two tranches, 24% and 36%. For 
borrowers who have not repaid interest, the lender 
must not ask for an APR higher than 24%. The 
amount exceeding 24% will not be protected by law. 
For borrowers who have already paid interest, 
borrowers can request the amount of interest 
exceeding APR of 36% to be returned.


LX’s APR has been consistently over 24% in 2018Q4  
and will likely continue to rise due lower asset credit 
qualities and the installment on installment scheme. 
This has been above the legal interest rate. Borrowers 
can refuse to pay such amounts. In other words, the 
increase of APR cannot go on. 


Furthermore, the recent regulation in China will likely 
further limit the company’s ability to charge exces-
sive APR.


Overall High APR


Deteriorating Credit Performance
Another symptom we can expect is the deterioration 
of credit performance measured by many factors, 
including vintage rate, charge-o� rate, delinquency 
rate, and default rates. While some are more reliable 
than others, in the case of LX, we see deterioration in 
all metrics. 


Vintage Rate
Vintage rate is de�ned as the amount of net delin-
quent loans during a period (vintage) to the total 
amount of loans originated during that same period. 
The metric is more reliable than the delinquency rate 
since delinquency rates can easily be manipulated by 
growth.  


Below is the chart of LX’s vintage rate up to Q2 
2020. As we can see, the lines that are to the 
upper-left tend to be shorter than those to the 
lower left. The length of the line corresponds to 
the period of origination. Shorter lines indicate 
that less time has passed, thus corresponds to 
more recent periods, and longer lines correspond 
to more distant periods. We see that newer vintag-
es are having higher delinquency rates, indicating 
lower credit quality.  


Source:  Company �lings


Vintage Rate Curve of LX from 2015Q1 to 2020Q2.


We see a taller vintage curve due to lower quality 
loans being packaged together into newer loans.
As discussed below, a tall vintage curve indicates a 
recent deterioration of asset quality. We believe as 
LX repackages delinquent loans and selling them 
to investors, they are postponing the inevitable 
delinquency into later periods. This can already be 
seen in the changes in the vintage curve. We 
believe this trend will continue and that LX’s loans 
will become even riskier.

We Believe the Company is Masquerading Deteriorating 
Credit Quality (Cont’d)
In comparison, LX’s competitor QFIN demonstrates 
higher stability in their products’ creditworthiness. 


Source:  QFIN Company �lings


QFIN’s vintage curve appears to be much �atter.


Vintage Charge-o� Rate
Vintage Charge-o� rate, more commonly known as 
default rate is the amount of loan that was 
charged-o� (due to default) during a speci�c period 
(vintage) to the total loan amount originated during 
the same period. 


Source:  Company �lings


LX’s charge-o� rates appear to be consistently around 3%, however we 
believe this is just an illusion. 


Delinquency Rate


Delinquency rates can be fairly misleading. It is de�ned by the delinquent amount over the total outstanding 
loan balance of a given period. It can be easily manipulated to portray a better risk pro�le by simply issuing more 
loans.


We see that apart from the latest quarter Q2 2020, 
charge-o� rates have been consistantly around 3%. 
However, as we’ve previously shown, this datapoint is 
not to be relied upon. 


As we can see, each decrease in delinquency rate was accompanied by much higher growth in outstanding 
principal relative to delinquent amount. By expanding the denominator at a faster speed, LX can arti�cially keep 
their delinquency rate lower and portray healthy loan performance. 


When we consider the total e�ect of charge-o�s (default) and the highly uncollectable M3+ Delinquent loans, we 
see that as of Q1 2020, total potential downfall can be between 6.1% to 7.1%. This is equivalent to around 4.4B 
RMB, or roughly $630M. 


According to the latest 20-F, LX has an allowance for credit loss for �nancial receivables of RMB 374 million, way 
short of covering the potential risks.

Valuation


August 25th 2020


We believe there are severe risks that have not been 
correctly modeled into the current valuation, 
including the hidden portion of delinquency and 
default risks and the existential risk incurred by the 
recent policies regarding civil-lending hurdle 
interest rates. We further consider hidden liabilities 
brought by the old P2P model and the real e�ect of 
back-to-back guarantees. 


E�ect of Hidden Portion of Delinquency and Default Risks


According to our model the income statement is 
a�ected by one-time charges of RMB 372M due to 
delinquency and default risk adjustments, and an 
annual decrease of RMB 4.082B in 2020 due to hurdle 
interest rate changes. As a result, shareholder equity is 
decreased to RMB 1.85B in 2020Q1, and to negative 
value by the third quarter of 2020. We believe the 
company is essentially insolvent. 


We compared delinquency data and default data of 
many publicly traded peers with LX to project the 
estimated potential e�ect on its income statement. 
The e�ect from delinquency data amounts to RMB 
95M in one-time charges. The e�ect from defaults on 
costs amounts to over RMB 400M in one-time 
charges. We give the company the bene�t of the 
doubt by applying a 25% discount to default charges 
due to LX’s superior “Eagle Eye” risk management 


system. The cumulative dollar e�ect amounts to RMB 
372.35M. 


As of Q1 2020, LX incurred RMB 678M in losses. To be 
fair, over RMB 1B in costs was due to provision for 
credit losses of contingent liabilities of guarantees due 
to the adoption of CECL. Nonetheless, even when we 
remove CECL e�ects, LX would still be unable to 
break-even in our model.

E�ect of Existential Risk due to Hurdle Interest Rate Changes


The e�ect of the hurdle interest rate changes is 
devastating. Simply put, if the new policies came 
into e�ect LX’s business model would be rendered 
uneconomical. 


Currently, LX averages an overall 27% APR and 
spends around 8.1% on funding costs. Were the 
hurdle rate to decrease to 4x LPR rate, which 
currently stabilizes around 15.4%, LX should see an 
immediate decrease of 12% in credit spread. Note 
that funding costs are unlikely to decrease due to 
institutional investors demanding a risk premium 
when investing money in risky assets on LX’s 
platform. 


We removed any e�ect of the adoption of CECL. 
However, despite our courtesy, after considering the 
e�ect of hurdle rate changes, LX’s still looks like it is 
facing a fundamentally broken business model. We 
forecast a whopping RMB 4B decrease in 2020’s Net 
Income or approximately RMB 1B per quarter. 


To be fair, we do believe this is an industry-wide 
headwind and will likely cause a similar impact on 
other companies. However, we believe LX will be hit 
harder than most, due to its higher loan origination 
volume and higher total outstanding loan balance.

E�ect of Legacy P2P Model Liabilities


As previously noted, Juzi Licai’s old model is not covered by the newly implemented RSS. Rather they are protect-
ed by a quality assurance program that ceased operation in April 2018. Currently, there are still RMB 821.4M 
liabilities outstanding. We believe this is a direct impact on shareholder equity. 


Valuation Summary


After considering the full e�ect of all adjustments, we believe LX’s share price will only continue to trend down. 
We conclude that LX will soon be worthless.    


Source:  Grizzly Analysis, Company �lings


Some industry analysts consider LX a better player in an overall bad subprime lending industry, but we think LX is among 
the worst companies because:


- Under-reported delinquency rate and default rate, in our opinion, exaggerated the company’s net income and share-
holder equity to a large extent


-  The company is still in the loan origination expansion mode, and also has a larger outstanding loan balance, which 
puts it in greater risk under the new hurdle rate policy. The issues are only exacerbated by the borderline fraudulent 
practices of LX masking its deteriorating loan quality


- Stock performed relatively well compared to competitors in the past year, yet but still faces the existential risk that the 
proposed new hurdle rate policy might just put every company in this sector out of business, which means LX might 
have further downside from here


-  Weakness in corporate governance that make us question the integrity of LX's financials such as undisclosed related 
parties and large financial restatements in the past

Outrageous Financial Restatement in Q1 2019


August 25th 2020


The reason why LX entered into our radar was the 
outrageous Q1 2019 restatement that happened 
in the company’s Q2 2019 earnings release. This 
restatement also serves as a red �ag that investors 
should have recognized. 


What really caught our eye is the big restatement of its 
previously reported Q1 2019 results. The table below 
illustrates the magnitude of the restatement. 


US$'000 As Reported As Restated in $ in % 
Interest and financial services income and other revenues 56,508 45,021 (11,487) -20.3%
Loan facilita�on and servicing fees 135,678 114,470 (21,208) -15.6%
Financial services income 192,186 159,491 (32,695) -17.0%


Net income 86,866 61,811 (25,055) -28.8%
Adjusted net income 92,738 67,551 (25,187) -27.2%
Non-GAAP EBIT 110,617 80,369 (30,248) -27.3%


Earnings per ADS $0.48 $0.34 ($0.14) -29.2%
Adjusted Earnings per ADS $0.51 $0.37 ($0.14) -27.2%


Retained earnings 324,067 293,694 (30,373) -9.4%


The reason for the restatement given by the 
company was mainly due to the “error” that was 
identi�ed about the revenue from �nancial 
services income. The revenue from �nancial 
services income for the �rst quarter of 2019 was 
overstated by RMB 129 million, due to “certain 
discounts and interests waived were not appropri-
ately recorded due to unintentional use of incor-
rect system reports in connection with the prepa-
ration of the �nancial statement adjustments for 
such discounts and waived interest.” In addition, 
the company also recorded an out-of-period 


adjustment of RMB 66.1 million to �nancial services 
income for the �rst quarter of 2019 “to correct the 
cumulative e�ect of errors in recording discounts and 
interests waived in the periods prior to December 31, 
2018. The out-of-period adjustment primarily resulted 
in a decrease of RMB63.6 million of interest and �nan-
cial services income and other revenues, and �nancing 
receivables, respectively.”


The fact that LX overstated results and had to adjust 
previously reported �nancials does not give the 
impression of great internal controls.

Other Red Flags


August 25th 2020


LX’s auditor has been PricewaterhouseCoopers 
Zhong Tian LLP since 2016. One thing we like to 
check is the audit fees trend along with the 


reported business development. Below is the table that 
summarizes the overall audit fees and operating metrics 
from 2016 to 2019. 


LX went public in 2017, which might be the reason 
for the audit fee jump from 2016 to 2017. Howev-
er, from 2017 to 2019, the annual total audit fees 
and audit-related fees together only increased 
from $2.46 million to $2.53 million, a 2.6% 
increase, yet the company’s reported revenue 
increased 77.5%, the outstanding principal 
balance of loans increased 193.7% and loan 


originations increased 146.8%, respectively. We are not 
saying that audit fees should increase at the same rate 
as compared to these operating metrics’ rate, however, 
the fact that the audit fees, in general, remained almost 
�at with the soared business development is some-
thing investors should pay attention to. In our opinion, 
this could be a red �ag for weak auditing/supervision 
process and warrants investors’ caution. 


 2016 2017 2018 2019 
% change from 
2017 to 2019 


Audit fees (US$) $691,637 $2,462,867 $2,268,926 $2,528,082

We are also cautious when it comes to manage-
ment overpaying themselves, especially when 
growth in management compensation outpaces 
revenue growth by a large margin. In the case of 


LX, while revenue has only doubled, management 
compensation has 6 folded. We see this as another 
red �ag.


Insider Selling


What’s perhaps more disturbing is the magnitude 
to which insiders have sold o� their shares in the 
�rm. Insider selling, typically regarded as a nega-
tive signal, is not an uncommon phenomenon. 
However, insider selling of this degree is clear sign 


of lack of con�dence in the company in our opinion.


We see that over the course of three years, insider 
position has decreased by half from 81.7% to just under 
40%.

Research report on LexinFintech Holdings Ltd. (NASDAQ: LX)


August 25th 2020


Conclusion


We have laid out in detail in this report why we are 
troubled by almost all aspects of LX. The company’s 
fundamental set up is a “Heads I win, tails you lose” 
situation. US investors are essentially guaranteeing 
payment of what we believe to be predatory consum-
er loans. Beyond that, we believe LX is making a 
conscious e�ort to misrepresent the viability of its 
business and the credit quality of its platforms. 


Recent reform on upper limit of interest rate essential-
ly renders LX’s business model non-feasible. Accord-
ing to our valuation model, LX’s will be unable to be 
pro�table. Moreover, we believe the income state-
ment is a�ected by one-time charges of RMB 372M 
due to delinquency and default risk adjustments, and 
an annual decrease of RMB 4.082B in 2020 due to 
hurdle interest rate changes. As a result, shareholder 
equity is decreased to RMB 1.85B in 2020Q1, and to 
negative value by the third quarter of 2020. We 
believe the company is essentially insolvent. 


The Coronavirus crisis and related quarantine mea-
sures have certainly had a profound impact on the 
global economy and China in particular. LX had run a 
low quality and potentially fraudulent credit business 


in China, and we believe the crisis has had a 
profound impact. Currently, LX is trying to stay alive 
by arti�cially extending extra credit to delinquent 
borrowers, but the Ponzi type nature of this activity 
will soon come to light. Make no mistake about it: 
We believe the Corona crisis has already put LX in a 
position where the public company is on the hook 
for a lot more liabilities than it purports– LX is just 
trying to masquerade that fact. 


Management seems to agree with our negative 
assessment of the company: Insiders and early 
investors sold shares aggressively and manage-
ment resorts to pocketing big cash compensations. 
The China hustle continues. 


In conclusion, we give LX a target price of ZERO.
