SS Central America Comes Up Short: Bankruptcy Countdown

Summary


SS Central America recovery coming up short: “only a few small containers”
recovered over the last month: We now believe the project will be clearly unprofitable
overall.


We model cash balance hitting zero, with likely corresponding required bankruptcy
filing July 16th after mid-month payroll & bills are paid.


Oceanica EIA still not filed, local environmental opposition appears to be building
strength.


Creditors and vendors likely to be impaired at this point given high liabilities and little
bill-paying cash liquid assets, will get worse with time and continued cash burn.


Odyssey Marine Exploration (NASDAQ:OMEX)'s fate appears to be coming down to the
wire with their two key projects, SS Central America and Oceanica entering their "show
me" phase in typical OMEX over-promise, under-deliver fashion. Just filed yesterday
afternoon, the court has lifted the seal on the inventory of the treasure and… It's about
time to tear up those lottery tickets and move on, the numbers have been called.


July 9, 2014 Letter To Court overseeing SS Central America: (emphasis ours)


Dear Judge Smith:


Pursuant to the Court's June 12, 2014 Order, we are writing regarding the upcoming
arrival of the vessel [Odyssey Explorer] in Charleston on July 14. It is anticipated
that there will be only a small number of artifacts available for offload and transport
to the substitute custodian, likely comprising only a few small containers. All of
these containers would easily fit into the trunk of a small vehicle.

Treasure is Not A Renewable Resource

Announced and inferred recoveries have been on a decline curve, which makes sense as
the best treasure would surely be recovered first. Things have declined from 1,000oz of
treasure in the first 3 hours to only 5,000oz in the first 6 weeks and now just "a few small
containers" after last month's work.


SS Central America Likely To Be An Unprofitable Project


We now believe there is strong evidence that the SS Central America, like every other
treasure hunting project, ever (Treasure Hunting Is the World's Worst Investment), will
ultimately be unprofitable at a project level given the high expenses and extremely
unprofitable when overhead costs are included:

Creditors and Vendors Likely to be Impaired At this Point


Based on our estimates (below) and in more detail here of the cash and liability balances,
we believe a bankruptcy filing on July 16th is highly probable. We certainly hope at a
minimum that OMEX does not bounce the paychecks of the men who have been working
out in the stormy seas and puts their interests ahead of executive paychecks. It does
seem likely at this point that there is no way that trade creditors will come out whole and
likely that Fifth Third will be impaired on their "secured" loan on the SS Central America
find, given that monetization is a long way away and there will likely be additional
expenses incurred between now and ultimate realization.


This Certainly Contrasts to CEO Greg Stemm's statements at the AGM just recently:

We've already recovered over $100,000 in 1857 face value of ingots and other gold


As for the site itself, there is one thing that I can tell you without any qualification -
and that is that anyone who thought that the previous operations twenty years ago
recovered all the gold and valuables from the site was clearly mistaken. Nearly every
day of seafloor operations produces new discoveries and recoveries of gold in a
dazzling array of different forms.


Now that we've completed recovery of most of the gold and valuable artifacts on
the surface outside the hull structure, we're starting on the excavation inside the hull
itself.


Our estimates of cash and liabilities indicate best case OMEX has cash to last until
August without a dilutive equity raise


Recall - the Fifth Third $10mm credit line is available for up to 50% of the appraised value
of ingots or $2,000 per coin for the first $5mm borrowed and half of this for the second.


So with generous assumptions that all the gold was coins (it was stated as less valuable
ingots…) at $100,000 face value = 5,000 oz * $20/oz. This would provide collateral for up
to $7.5mm on this credit line ($5mm/$2,000/coin + $2.5mm/$1,000/coin = 5,000 oz), or
$7mm unrestricted cash (there is a $500k restricted cash required as collateral that cannot
be touched). In this "best case" cash may last another 2-3 weeks given the rapid
$3mm/month cash burn.


Oceanica Monetization Appears Unlikely Given EIA Still Not Filed and Local
Environmental Opposition Appears to be Strengthening


6-4-2014 AGM Presentation: CEO, Greg Stemm: I am pleased to report that this [EIA]
filing - all 1,200 pages of it - is completed and ready to be filed shortly


See our other article for more details on this but it now appears there is substantial local
pushback from environmental groups and the projects is facing challenges that have not
been disclosed to shareholders.
