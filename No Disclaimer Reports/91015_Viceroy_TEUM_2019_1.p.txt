Pareteum  -  The Wild West of Telecoms 
Breach of Iran sanctions, related party and non-operational customers, anemic cash flows, 


uncollectable revenues.  


June 25, 2019 – Pareteum (NASDAQ:TEUM) provides services to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs), 


who sell data/minutes to users and purchase data/minutes from telecom network operators. Recently Pareteum 


has been subject to criticism from other short sellers. Given the discourse, Viceroy believe it is prudent that we 


also share our findings. 


▪ Further to recent research reports, Pareteum has a history of promotional press releases of customer wins. 


A deeper investigation into these customers show much larger number are insignificant, and the companies 


behind them appear in no way capable of fulfilling the contract values advertised by Pareteum. 


▪ Two of Pareteum’s customer wins appear to be undisclosed related parties tied to Pareteum consultant 


Dinesh “Danny” Patel. 


▪ One of Pareteum’s announced customer wins is a company under a historic investigation and charged with 


significant VAT evasion fraud. Information on this is easily available, leading us to believe that Pareteum 


was aware of the company’s issues while announcing the customer win. 


▪ Pareteum appears to be in breach of US sanctions against Iran through its provision of services to Iranian 


MVNO Amin SMC. Amin SMC appears to be chaired by Hamid Reza Amirinia, an individual suspected of 


breaching sanctions with an Iranian government mandate to launder money for the regime. 


▪ Several entities on the pareteum.cloud domain are small companies or have no web presence whatsoever, 


leading us to believe that they are Pareteum customers who are unable to pay or have no operations. 


▪ Pareteum’s 36-month contractual backlog measurement is not an accurate predictor of future profits. An 


analysis of the company’s backlog and management comments shows it should have reported 73.10% 


more revenue in Q1 2019 than it did. Management appears to be inflating this figure to hype up the share 


price and reassure investors. 


▪ Pareteum’s management has a history of dishonest reporting. Notably, CFO Ted O’Donnell who was sued 


by former employer AudioEye for fabricating US$8.1m worth of revenue over 3 quarters which was found 


to have no supporting documentation. This was an overstatement of revenues in the period of more than 


3,000%. 


▪ Pareteum’s rapid-fire announcement of customer wins mirrors its announcements regarding 


cryptocurrency in 2017, which were put to an abrupt halt when a response to an SEC letter revealed TEUM 


had made no revenue, nor planned to do so, from cryptocurrency. 


▪ Pareteum has made an US$3.7m loan to Yonder Media Mobile, an early stage MVNO operated by serial 


failure entrepreneur Adam Kidron. Kidron has burned at least US$100m in his enterprises, having already 


cratered the Yonder brand with a music streaming service which collapsed in 2017. 


▪ A breakdown of Pareteum’s revenues, cash flows and receivables show the majority of its revenue from 


sources other than Vodafone and acquired businesses iPass and Artilium appears to be uncollectable. 


Accordingly, we believe total revenue is overstated by 42%, corroborating our findings regarding Pareteum’s 


customers. 


We are as yet unable to quantify the impact of the company’s apparent breach of sanctions against Iran and 


have not assigned a discount. We have reported this apparent breach to the relevant federal authorities. 


A token valuation on an EV/Revenue basis presents a 44% - 76% downside for Pareteum’s share price (State 


Current Price), with the more severe scenario more probable. However, based on the numerous subjective 


issues highlighted in this report and the dependence of the valuation on our already-conservative revenue 


adjustment, we cannot fully quantify the downside, which we believe to be significant.

Attention: Whistleblowers 


Viceroy encourage any parties with information pertaining to misconduct within Pareteum or any other entity to file a report 


with the appropriate regulatory body.  


We also understand first-hand the retaliation whistleblowers sometimes face for championing these issues. Where possible, 


Viceroy is happy act as intermediaries in providing information to regulators and reporting information in the public interest 


in order to protect the identities of whistleblowers.

1. Background  


Pareteum provides services to Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) who sell data/minutes to users and 


purchase data/minutes from telecom network operators. Pareteum was formerly Elephant Talk 


Communications Corporation (NYSE:ETCC). The company’s largest historical customer is Vodafone Enabler S.L., 


an MVNO operating on Vodafone Spain’s network.  


Pareteum acquired 2 companies in the past year: Artilium, an organic-growth-challenged roll-up of telco service-


related assets, and iPass, a rapidly shrinking, negative free cash flow Wi-Fi hotspot provider. 


2. Customers: fakes, related parties, non-operational entities  


Several of Pareteum’s customers are either related parties, small companies incapable of accounting for the 


revenue reported by Pareteum or have no discernible web presence. The most egregious examples are some of 


the customers in Pareteum’s press releases detailing large contract wins.  


We have further reviewed Pareteum’s customers by searching the pareteum.cloud domain, together with 


Pareteum’s press releases.  


Since the release of Aurelius Value’s report, Pareteum has retracted and modified slide decks, specifically their 


customer lists. 


2.1. Possibly non-existent customers 


A search of Pareteum’s sub-domains for pareteum.cloud turns up customers  which we detail below. Some 


customers have very little information or web presence other than their Pareteum cloud login.  


Iboconnect.com 


Iboconnect has not been announced by Pareteum as a customer but uses a Pareteum sub-domain, 


ibo.pareteum.cloud. 


 
Figure 1 ibo.pareteum.cloud/account/login1 


The website is operated by ibo connect Limited incorporated by Isaac Blankson and Christina Danquah on July 


25, 20182. The largely incomplete website lists pre-paid SIM cards for purchase and many of the pages are 


unfinished with broken links.

Note : ecrosspay.pareteum.cloud is no longer operational at the time of publication. 


Voiptrade.pareteum.cloud & BigAppleMarketing.pareteum.cloud 


No online presence for either of these companies could be found. There are potential connections to the barely-


operational website voip-trade.com operated by VOIP-TRADE LTD, a UK entity incorporated on May 4, 2018.

Exaccta.pareteum.cloud 


This domain displays the logo of newweb.tuttogroup.com, a website purporting to sell SIM cards and associated 


services but has no way of online ordering. Newweb.tuttogroup.com6 also looks extremely similar to 


exactta.com (the Pareteum URL appears to be a typo), both of which are operated by Voiceserve Limited 


according to Tutto’s privacy policy.

Voiceserve Limited is a UK subsidiary of Voiceserve Inc8, a Delaware company formerly listed on the NASDAQ as 


VSRV9. Considering neither tuttogroup nor exactta have any method of selling their products we doubt Pareteum 


derives any revenue from these entities.

2.2. Pareteum’s Breach Party: Iran Sanctions Violation 


Pareteum appears to be in breach of US sanctions against Iran by providing hosting services, and potentially 


extending mobile virtual network services, to Amin S.M.C. (Amin), an Iranian MVNO established in 2017. Amin 


is chaired by Hamid Reza Amirinia, an individual suspected of skirting sanctions with an Iranian government 


mandate and money laundering for the regime through an entity specifically sanctioned by the Office of Foreign 


Asset Controls. 


Amin’s website is either managed or created by Pareteum judging by the 2017 Pareteum copyright in the lower 


left hand corner of the page and the use of the amin.pareteum.cloud domain13. 


 
Figure 8 amin.pareteum.cloud14 


There are several inconsistencies on the Amin website: prices are quoted in Euros, the website itself is in English 


by default and does not appear to redirect to Amin’s local Iranian website. One would expect the website to be 


in Farsi and the currency to be denominated in Rials. The photos on the site still have watermarks.

Validsoft UK filed for bankruptcy and restructured, largely due to a defaulted receipt from Pareteum

Beyond that the website appears to be either broken or incomplete; most links redirect back to the homepage 


or don’t work at all. While checkout functionality appears to work, no details on any of its plans are available; 


there is also no list for countries when entering customer details. We are unsure who is processing these 


payments.

The assets of these entities are blocked, and U.S. persons are prohibited from dealing with them without 


exemption from OFAC. The Center of Innovation and Technology Cooperation is specifically listed under the 


Iranian Financial Sanctions program AND the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferators Sanctions 


Regulations program. Amirinia’s position as chairman of Amin SMC and director of the Center for Innovation 


and Technology Cooperation certainly makes him “involved” with Pareteum’s Amin SMC dealings. 


More recent evidence is the listing of jobs in Iran by Elephant Communications, Pareteum’s former name on 


LinkedIn and recruitment agency hamiijobs, the latter bearing the company’s logo. Google’s snippets show the 


listings are fairly recent; July and December 2018. The hamiijobs listing appears to be the only listing on the 


website for jobs in Iran. 


This further complicates matters as it appears Pareteum might still be operating in the country, not just 


rendering services to Iranian entities. We have not been able to find a Pareteum subsidiary in Iran so far.

Figure 20 COUNCIL DECISION amending Decision 2010/413/CFSP concerning restrictive measures against Iran 


The SEC have previously questioned Pareteum regarding their Zain business in 2017 regarding exposure to Syria 


and Sudan, which the company asserted did not exist24. In light of the newly imposed sanctions against Iran and 


its officials we do not believe this will be taken lightly by the relevant authorities25. 


At best, Pareteum is likely in ongoing violation of US sanctions, at worst they are facilitating a money 


laundering scheme. Note the People’s Mojahedin Organization of Iran report was released in 2012, and the 


api.dowjones site has the story published in September 2018. For Pareteum be so negligent would be a major 


failure of due diligence. We have informed the relevant authorities including the Treasury’s Office of Foreign 


Assets  


2.3. October 2, 2018: Pareteum Adds $15 Million in New Contracts 


 
Figure 21 Pareteum Press Release26 


On October 2, 2018 Pareteum announced US$15m in new contracts with Parallax Sciences, oneCentral and 


Naledi. Our investigation showed none of these entities can be expected to generate this level of revenue. 


Parallax Health Sciences 


Parallax Health Sciences (OTCPK:PRLX) is a penny stock public company with no discernable asset base, 


~US$12,000 in sales for 2018 sales and 7 employees on LinkedIn27 at the time of writing.  


As noted by Aurelius Value, Parallax’s executives include the Pareteum CFO, Edward O’Donnell and former 


business associates from AudioEye including AudioEye’s former CEO who was named alongside O’Donnell in a 


case alleging fraud.

Naledi 


Naledi Telecoms is a South African startup MVNO that appears to still not have launched. A Google South Africa

Million Contract 


 
Figure 23 Pareteum Press Release29 


On October 2, 2018 Pareteum announced a 3-year US$50m contract with One Development. Our investigation 


shows that One-Development has no way of fulfilling this contract. We question whether One Development 


even signed such a contract given how far beyond its scale it is.

One Development 


One Development was incorporated in 2014 and awarded an MVNO license in July 201830. The company has 7 


employees on LinkedIn31 and has had no meaningful business in the 4 years since its incorporation. None of its 


founders have a particularly impressive background.  


 
Figure 24 One Development – We Connect Thailand LinkedIn profile32 


One Development does business through weconnectthailand.com but is actually called “The One Development 


(Thailand) Company Limited”. Financials of Thai companies are publicly available through the Department of 


Business Development’s DBDWarehouse33. Filings for One Development shows a small loss-making company 


with no capacity to fulfil a US$50m, 3-year contract. The entity made a 2018 gross profit of US$5,685.54.

2.5. October 17, 2018: Pareteum Announces $8 Million in New Agreements 


 
Figure 26 Pareteum Press Release35 


Paretuem did not disclose the “international water technologies company handling smart metering” nor the 


“pet device monitoring company” but the other two entities, Monogoto and Nextelle are both either inactive or 


small scale enterprises. 


Monogoto 


Monogoto was incorporated in 2014 and lists 8 employees on Linkedin.  


 
Figure 27 monogoto LinkedIn profile36 


The company’s website does not have any way to order online or by phone and has no payment mechanism 


available37. The sign-in link is inactive at the time of writing38.  


Nextelle 


Nextelle39 is something of a curiosity: the company claims to be a US company but appears to be solely owned 


by Dave Sharma and operated out of a mail box in Queensland, Australia. Nextelle.com does have a functioning 


website and appears to sell SIM cards and other internet services. The company also advertises its services on 


classified sites.

SJ Global Investments London and Global Connect. 


Global Connect and SJ Global appear to be undisclosed Pareteum related parties and customers. Neither of these 


companies appear large enough to account for the value assigned to their contracts by Pareteum.  


While only Global Connect was announced by the company SJ Global is also a customer and more clearly 


illustrates the connections between Pareteum and some of its customers. 


SJ Global Investments London Limited – Introducing the Patels 


SJ Global is a customer of Pareteum as shown by the sjglobal.pareteum.cloud domain, a login page. 


 
Figure 31 sjglobal.pareteum.cloud/account/login47 


Dinesh “Danny” Patel, a Pareteum consultant, is also the Director of SJ Global Worldwide Investment Limited. 


 
Figures 32 & 33 Dinesh “Danny” Patel LinkedIn profile48 


We do not believe the SJ Global on the Pareteum site is SJ Global Investments Worldwide, but SJ Global 


Investments London, a separate company wholly owned by Rahul Patel incorporated on January 8, 2018. Rahul 


is the business associate and possible relative (likely son, based on his date of birth) of Dinesh “Danny” Patel.

SJ Global Investments Worldwide does list its address as Suite 16, 107 Cheapside London and Danny Patel does 


work for SJ Global Investments Worldwide as he appears in a UK team photo on the company’s website. 


 
Figure 35 SJ Global Investment Worldwide UK Team photo (Patel second from right)50 


It appears Pareteum’s global consultant Danny Patel has been used to create related party contracts of 


questionable integrity. Given the minor size of many of these companies we suspect these parties are being used 


to generate false revenue. 


Global Connect 


Global Connect is described in the release as “a communication services internet of things company with 


multinational clients focused on home automated solutions.” 


Rahul Patel acquired 50% of Global Connect Solutions51 from Andrew Kemp on May 1, 2018, six months prior to 


the contract announcement.

WorldSim 


WorldSim’s is operated by Synectiv Limited, currently run by Asif Chandoo. Synectiv and its operators were part 


of a fraud case in the UK regarding VAT evasion. The former directors of the company, including Asif’s brother, 


Arif, were arrested in 2001 over this evasion. 





 
Figure 38  Appeal number: TC/2010/0669956 


While the appeals are ongoing, this effectively means that Synectiv T/A Worldsim is likely barred from trading. 


 
Figure 39 worldsim.com cookie policy57 


Note that information on the VAT fraud case is easily found through internet search and the former directors of 


Synectiv are all listed on the companieshouse database, implying Pareteum knows full well they were dealing 


with an entity under investigation for fraud at the time of their announcement. 


Moby 


The link in Pareteum’s press release, mobywireless.com redirects to a different company, Hawaiian MVNO Mobi, 


Inc.

Moby Wireless also has a facebook.com page58 on which it posts advertising and more links that redirect to Mobi 


web pages including a mobywireless.com/imei.php link that results in a 404 error on Mobi’s servers. 


The company’s manta.com59 profile lists its website as wirelesslinkgroup.com, which redirects to 


wlgwholesale.com an electronics wholesaler headquartered at an electronics store in Long Island City, New York 


operated by Bo Guo. 


 
Figure 41 wlgwholesale.com60 


We have as yet found no other connection between the WirelessLink Group mentioned above and the entity 


mentioned in Pareteum’s press release that is operating the Facebook pages selling SIM cards. Strangely the 


shares on the Facebook page are highly concentrated in the Jamestown, NY area. 


We do not believe Moby Wireless will be generating any significant revenue for Pareteum. 


2.7. September 17: Pareteum Secures $50 Million in New Contracts During August

ACN Europe and Wing Tel Communications appear to be able to pay Pareteum: Secure Watch is a security

Viceroy Research Group 24 viceroyresearch.org 


The company was incorporated in July 2018 in Delaware and has 9 employees on LinkedIn and a boilerplate 


website. Yonder Media Mobile describes its plans to launch a “Mobile Virtual Experience Platform” but its profile 


on Kidron’s website Adam+co claims the company plans to launch in Latin America in fall 201972.  


Yonder Media Mobile’s founder and CEO Adam Kidron’s history of failed entrepreneurship:  


- Urban Box Office Network 


A web portal linking several sites for urban music, entertainment and information. A 2001 New York Times article 


claims a total of US$34m has thus far been invested and presumably lost: the company did not deny allegations 


it had a “burn rate” of US$1m a day73. 


- Beyond Oblivion 


Beyond Oblivion was the subject of an Evolver.FM investigative article describing the company’s wild promises 


and subsequent implosion74. The article paints a picture of Kidron as an irresponsible and erratic CEO; Beyond 


Oblivion failed spectacularly before launch, taking US$87m of investors’ money with it75. 


- 4food 


A “build your own burger” chain founded in New York in 2010. While investment was planned to launch 3 


locations76, only one ever opened on September 7, 201077 and closed its doors on April 25, 201478. 4food’s 


website is still operational though parts of it are broken. 


- Yonder Music 


The “Yonder” brand has already crashed; Kidron launched Yonder Music in parts of Asia (Nepal, Malaysia and 


Indonesia that we could ascertain) from 2016 through 2017. The platform was discontinued effective June 15, 


2018 with a facebook update claiming it was unable to secure investments for the platform.   


Investors should be asking: why is Pareteum lending to Kidron? 


Yonder Media Mobile’s instances on the Pareteum.cloud have no content associated with them.

4. Financial Issues 


4.1. Revenue Collection Analysis 


Pareteum’s filings state they bill monthly, and that “the term between invoicing and payment is due is not 


significant”. Realistically, this would imply a days receivable figure of between 30-45 days, allowing for some 


delinquent customers.  


Pareteum has 4 months accounts receivable sitting on its balance sheet. When combined with the drastic 


increase in receivable days since the end of 2017, it appears that Pareteum’s new customers are not paying their 


bills. Despite this Pareteum’s management continues to recognize this apparent uncollectable revenue from 


customers. 


The analysis below breaks down revenue, cash and receivables from: 


1. Artilium and iPass, the acquired entities; 


2. Vodafone, the anchor customer; and 


3. Pareteum’s other customers 


 
Figure 52 Viceroy Cash Collection Analysis 


We assume that: 


▪ The significant customer accounting for 40% of revenue in the 2018 10-K and 20.1% of revenue in Q1 2019 


is Vodafone.  


▪ Pareteum is getting paid by Vodafone on regular billing terms; Vodafone has historical days receivable 


between 7 and 30 days from 2016 onward. We assume a consistent 20 days outstanding through 2018 and 


Q1 2019.

40%
Viceroy Research Group 26 viceroyresearch.org 


▪ Pareteum’s acquired businesses iPass and Artilium are getting paid on “typical” billing terms of 30 days, per 


management assertion. It is noteworthy that this is not strictly true:  


o Artilium’s last publicly available financials show 77.473 receivable days and claim that the average 


credit period on sales to be 87 days as of June 30, 2018.  


o iPass’s Q3 2018 10-Q  revenue and receivables figures show 78.155 receivable days with standard 


credit terms of 30 days. 


▪ iPass’ purchase price accounting allocated US$4.344m in accounts receivable to Pareteum’s balance sheet.  


▪ Artilium’s purchase price accounting allocated a negligible amount of accounts receivable to Pareteum’s 


balance sheet: it appears Pareteum wrote a significant balance off. We have not accounted for this 


negligible balance. 


According to our model Pareteum has collected only 4% of the revenue recognized from these customers in the 


12 months trailing Q1 2019. While this figure is probably lower than Pretium’s actual collections, it creates a 


Catch-22 situation where receivables from Artilium and iPass are also growing exponentially.  


4.2. Cash Flow Irregularities 


As a sign of reality beginning to kick in, Pareteum has taken to paying its suppliers in equity as seen in Q1 2019’s 


US$1.5m figure of “Services settled by issuance of shares”.

5. Management  


5.1. History of fraud, collapsing stocks 


Several of Pareteum’s senior management have a history of involvement with collapsing stocks and poor 


governance. In particular: 


- Robert Harold “Hal” Turner – Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Officer 


- Edward “Ted” O’Donnell – Chief Financial Officer 


- Victor “Vic” Bozzo – Chief Executive Officer 


- Denis McCarthy – President    


Robert Harold “Hal” Turner 


Pareteum’s Executive Chairman and Principal Executive Hal Turner has a history of collapsed business and 


misleading shareholders. Turner joined Pareteum as Executive Chairman on November 17, 201579 


Turner has previously: 


▪ Served as CEO of Davnet, an Australian-listed company which collapsed with the dotcom bubble due to 


massive liquidity issues. A full account of the Davnet fraud is detailed in the book “Dot. Bomb Australia” by 


Kate Askew: 


“It turned out that Hal Turner, the American who took over at the helm of Davnet from Stephen 


Moignard in February 2001, had excellent money-dissipating skills. He did a great job of regularly 


racking up monthly expenses bills of $50,000.” 


“In hindsight, there was little doubt that when Turner had been in charge in 2000–01 there was much 


going on in the company—and in its financials. Davnet’s asset position fell by $100 million to not much 


more than $21 million. At the same time, its cash reserves shrank by $72 million, leaving about $11 


million in the once-bursting company coffers. And Turner was anything if not generous. He parted 


company with Davnet after writing himself a $200,000 cheque for services rendered, and made sure to 


include a $16,000 expenses bill.” 


“Turner’s next stop was back in the USA. In February 2007 he was bought in to run a company called 


Catcher Holdings. By December, only 10 months later, Turner had again resigned. When Turner 


departed, the company had about $US100,000 to keep it going. “ 


“Turner was last seen in 2010 at a company called Pac-West Telecomm. He was brought in to run the 


company in January 2008 after it had emerged as a private company following filing for Chapter 11 


bankruptcy in May 2007 as a publicly listed company” 


▪ Director of LastMile Communications from December 14, 2005 to June 6, 200680  a UK telecoms company 


liquidated in 2007. 


▪ CEO of Pac-West Telecomm, Inc. from January 2008 to May 2011. Pac-West Telecomm had previously 


reorganized from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 200781. On March 28, 2013, Pac-West filed again for Chapter 11 


protection82.

Viceroy Research Group 28 viceroyresearch.org 


▪ CEO of Catcher Holdings from February 21, 2007 through December 18, 2007 whose share price fell from 


US$1.40 to US$0.73 amid going concern issues. Turner made enthusiastic quotes similar to those now being 


issued at Pareteum regarding large customer wins. The revenues never materialized and Catcher Holdings’ 


stock price fell to US$0 and was suspended from trading by the SEC in January 2012 for lack of filings since 


September 200783. 


 
Figure 55 Catcher Holdings Share Price chart 


Along for the “Hal Turner ride” were Denis McCarthy and Vic Bozzo; McCarthy served as CFO at Catcher Holdings 


from December 6, 2006 to January 29, 2008 and Bozzo served as Chief Sales and Marketing Officer and President 


and GM of Telastic services at Pac-West Telecomm from July 2010 to August 2011. 


Edward “Ted” O’Donnell 


If Hal Turner is the architect of the Pareteum current predicament, then Edward O’Donnell is the chief foreman 


it its construction. O’Donnell has a history of poor financial management, involvement with fraud and dishonest 


disclosure to investors. 


▪ CFO of Radbourne Property Group which was charged with fraud. The Radbourne Property Group was run 


by John Van Clief about whom there is a surprising amount of information online showing the group was 


engaged in small-time fraud and failure to pay several liens84. O’Donnell’s Bloomberg profile states: 


“[O’Donnell’s] primary responsibilities included raising capital, external reporting, outlining capital structure 


and budgeting.”.  


▪ CFO of AMERI Holdings, Inc (AMRH) from January 2016 through December 2016. which sank from US$6.50 


to US$0.44. Trading in this time was largely dominated by Lone Star Value Management, the vehicle 


managed by Jeff Eberwein, who was later the subject of a cease-and-desist order by the SEC for beneficial 


ownership reporting breaches85. We believe it is telling that AMERI Holdings is the only company at which 


O’Donnell was the CFO whose share price did not deteriorate during his tenure.

▪ CFO of spinoff AudioEye (NASDAQCM:AEYE) from December 2010 through January 2013 which sank from 


US$28.00 to US$12.13 during his tenure. 


▪ VP of Finance at Augme Technologies which sank from US$2.94 to US$0.45 during his tenure. 


▪ CFO of Carlyle Capital Group LLC, a company aping the name of The Carlyle Group to make VC and PE 


investments. As far as we have found the only mentions of the Carlyle Capital Group LLC are on Pareteum 


releases and as the employer of William C. Samuels, a New York progressive Democrat. Samuels also 


founded ACTV, at which O’Donnell worked. We are still unsure of the purpose, existence and scale of the 


Carlyle Capital Group. 


▪ President at construction firm Aloysius Lyons which declared chapter 7 bankruptcy in 2007 after petitioning 


for chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2007 as well. The company’s website was non-functioning from at least March 


2004 to February 200586. 


 
Figure 56 Troubled Company Reporter March 19, 2007 Vol. 11, No. 6687 


It is O’Donnell’s actions at AudioEye that first caught our attention. Action was later taken against O’Donnell 


for his actions at Audioeye, which include fabrication of revenue and contract value, allegedly overstating the 


company’s revenues by more than 3,000% with no supporting documentation. We believe this has parallels to 


the situation at Pareteum with non-operating customers.

5.2. Misleading and promotional behavior 


Pareteum management has made misleadingly promotional statements, more regularly in the past 2 years. 


Backlog promotion and backlog spreadsheet 


Pareteum management often discusses and promotes the company in the context of its 36-month contract 


revenue backlog. While the company’s financial performance has been less than stellar this internal metric has 


skyrocketed since Q1 2017 when it was first discussed.  


While this would appear to be a proxy for future profitability there are several inconsistencies in both the 


company’s disclosure of this figure and of its past performance. 


Hal Turner defined the backlog in the Q1 2019 earnings call as: 


“We do review these sales and their revenue under contract on a snapshot basis at any given point in time, 


and we look at it for the following 36 months and that gives us a view of revenues under contract. We call 


this our 36 month contract revenue backlog.” [emphasis added] 


1. Pareteum’s revenue should be far higher based on its past disclosure regarding backlog. 


2. There are periods in which net backlog increases by the amount of additions in the quarter implying no 


backlog revenue was converted, contrary to management comments.  


Backlog does not predict revenue 


An analysis of Pareteum’s backlog shows the company is not converting its revenue at the rate it claims to be. 


We conducted two analyses: 


1. Backlog conversion occurs at the rate management claimed in the Q1 2018 earnings call: 15% of 


contract value in the first year, 30% in the second and 55% in the third. 


2. Backlog conversion occurs at the rate management claimed in the Q3 2018 earnings call: 20% of 


contract value in the first year, 43% in the second and 89% in the third. If you’re thinking “wait, that’s 


more than 100%!”, you have not considered, as Pareteum management have, that customers can 


arbitrarily exceed their backlog quote. Management have worked this into their forecast. In true 


Spinal-Tap fashion, couldn’t you just make 10 louder? 


 
Figure 58 Pareteum Conference Call transcript, Q1 2018
Viceroy Research Group 31 viceroyresearch.org 


Our analysis was performed by finding the difference in backlog between periods, multiplying it by the 


percentage collected in the relevant year of the contract’s life, then dividing it into quarters equally. By doing 


this for every quarter’s “generation” of new backlog, we can build a picture of expected revenue from backlog.

The following assumptions were made in the analysis: 


▪ The net change in backlog is equal to the value of new contracts signed in that period. Note that 


customers dropping off contracts is irrelevant as we use net change in backlog for our calculations.  


▪ While Pareteum does disclose the new contract backlog added in the quarter in some disclosures, this 


is not consistent enough to build a useful picture of the backlog conversion. 


▪ Contracts signed within the quarter are treated as being effective as of the last day of the quarter. For 


example, the change in backlog between Q3 & Q4 2016 would start to generate revenue in Q1 2017. 


▪ Backlog is evenly billed throughout the year. For example, if 15% of contract value is converted in a 


year then 3.75% of that contract revenue would be recognized each quarter.  


▪ We have used backlog data from Q3 2016 onward, as a result our analysis underrepresents the 


backlog revenue in earlier periods for this reason. Were we to include earlier figures the discrepancy 


would be larger, not smaller, as the backlog has never shrunk. Further as backlog has increased 


exponentially the significance in future periods of excluding earlier periods is reduced. 


Based on the Q1 2018 earnings call estimates, Pareteum should have made at least US$3.833m (16.85%) 


more in revenue in Q1 2019 than it reported in revenue.  


Based on the more recent Q3 2018 earnings call estimates Pareteum should have made 


US$13.824m (73.10%) more in Q1 2019 than it reported in revenue. 


In conclusion, we believe backlog has been significantly overstated, either in its conversion rate or its value. Its 


exponential increase has made it an inaccurate tool for modelling Pareteum’s future revenue and management 


should revise its backlog figures or retire the measurement altogether. Investors should be wary of using it as 


any sign of the company’s performance. 


Pareteum not collecting on Backlog 


For example, in Q2 2018 Pareteum’s backlog was stated as US$276m with US$21m incremental from existing 


contracts, and the increase in the quarter was stated as US$55m based on newly awarded contracts. The 


company’s Q1 2018 backlog was US$200m implying that the US$76m difference was only newly awarded 


contracts and incremental revenue leaving no net reduction in backlog.  


The math leaves no space for Pareteum to have collected any backlog in this period.

Viceroy Research Group 33 viceroyresearch.org 


It was a similar story in Q3 2018 when Pareteum’s backlog was stated as US$403m with US$72m in incremental 


from existing contracts, and the increase in the quarter from newly awarded contracts was US$127m. 


 
Figure 62 Pareteum Announces Record Third Quarter 2018 Results89 


Considering the difference between the Q3 and Q2 backlogs is equal to the newly awarded contracts we 


question where the US$72m from existing contracts is accounted for. The only reason the backlog addition in 


Q2 reconciled was the incremental backlog. 


Pareteum bills monthly so its backlog additions should exceed the net increase of the backlog. This is not the 


case. 


Perhaps unsurprisingly the backlog is not kept by CFO Ted O’Donnell but President Denis McCarthy in a 


spreadsheet according to the Q4 2018 earnings call Q&A (given O’Donnell’s history, we doubt this makes much 


a difference).  


 
Figure 63 2018 Q4 Earnings Call Transcript 


Since McCarthy joined the company in January 2018 the backlog has skyrocketed. Note that McCarthy does not 


sign off on the company’s SEC filings. 


Blockchain promotion 


Through 2017 and 2018 Pareteum management heavily promoted their blockchain business in several press 


releases. Readers will remember 2017 as the year that blockchain went berserk and it appears Pareteum 


management wanted to cash in on the craze.

Figure 64 Various Pareteum Press Releases 


On November 19, 2018 Pareteum received a comment letter from the SEC questioning, amongst other things, 


the company’s actual involvement in cryptocurrency. 


Regarding claims to be a blockchain-enabler platform, its status and the existence of any revenue from that 


platform: 


 
Figure 65 Pareteum response letter 90 


“To date, blockchain in this example is only used to allow for the deployment of a payment gateway to 


mobile phone subscribers, allowing customers to extend into a dual purpose payment gateway and 


deploy their own or existing blockchain functionality. We are not involved in any blockchain 


transactions, we merely facilitate the mechanism by which a mobile phone subscriber can use any form 


of payment their service provider will accept. 


To date presumably due to the fluctuation of crypto currency we don’t believe any services have been 


launched as of yet that will accept crypto currency for payment. We currently generate no revenue from 


customers utilizing this platform for blockchain-related services and do not plan to do so in the future. 


We do not believe this previously-proposed offering is material to our business at this time.” 


Regarding their claims of a cryptocurrency payment system and the deployment of new or existing digital tokens: 


 
Figure 66 Pareteum response letter 


“We have no plans to engage in any crypto currency mining, have no plans to create our own digital 


currency and have no plans to act as a verification service for digital currency only to provide access to 


existing functionality for our customers using the power of blockchain.” 


Regarding their relationship with cryptocurrency provider AirFox:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1084384/000114420418062787/filename1.htm
Viceroy Research Group 35 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 67 Pareteum response letter 


“AirFox asked us to act as a referral to our customers for their service. 


Though we continue to maintain a professional relationship with AirFox and have not terminated our 


partnership arrangement with AirFox at this time, AirFox has not deployed any mobile-phone related 


services and has discontinued this portion of their business for the time being. We have not and do not 


plan in the near future to generate any revenue from our relationship with AirFox.” 


This response was after a year’s worth of heavy promotion of blockchain on Pareteum’s platform in the form of 


press releases and white papers. The facts of the case are that Pareteum never had, nor were there real plans 


for, any blockchain related business or revenue. 


6. Valuation 


Pareteum management have made a point of claiming that EBITDA and free cash flow will be positive through 


2019. Our adjustment shows that to be incorrect returning negative EBITDA and free cash flow. We believe our 


adjustments are fairly conservative due to the assumptions made regarding iPass and Artilium operating on 


regular billing terms.  


We do not believe EBITDA and free cash flow will be positive in 2019 or beyond unless the company significantly 


changes its customer base, billing practices and sales operations (likely in a scaled down manner). 


Additionally there is the governance issue of sanctions breaches, possible disclosure breaches, related party 


issues and the very real possibility of financial restatements. 


In light of this, a valuation using only the adjusted revenue figure is something of a moot point – we believe the 


business, in its current form, is terminally unprofitable. We have included one for the sake of completeness. 


Finding accurate comparisons is tricky, as many MVNOs are privately held, and listed MVNO’s are much larger 


and profitable.

Figure 68 Viceroy Valuation 


Pareteum is also an outlier with 8x8, Inc regarding EV/Revenue. Using only 8x8, Inc’s EV/Revenue results in a 


downside of 44%. 


A token valuation on an EV/Revenue basis presents a 44% - 76% downside for Pareteum’s share price. Further 


risks highlighted in this report are difficult to quantify. Together with a conservative revenue adjustment, we 


believe the downside risk is much greater. 


7. Conclusion 


At a glance Pareteum’s growth story could be described as suspicious. After our investigation we believe this 


growth story is completely broken and may not have ever existed at all. Investors should take a look at the 


damage inflicted on Catcher Holdings, Davnet and AudioEye as a sign of things to come if management is 


investigated or held accountable for its actions. 


We advise investors to call for a fully independent investigation of management, in particular: Hal Turner and 


Ted O’Donnell and for an investigation of the company’s revenue recognition practices and internal controls.
