Corrections & Commentary on Asanko’s “Response to K2” 


Asanko published a rebuttal to our report on their website.  The full version can be found at 


https://www.asanko.com/investors/response-to-k2, and the full version of our report can be 


found at www.asankoreport.com.  


Asanko’s rebuttal mischaracterises numerous aspects of our report and fails to address the 


majority of our technical criticisms. 


Before addressing their rebuttal, we feel it is important to remind investors that much of our 


thesis is data-driven, and the Company should, in our view, be in current possession of the 


requisite data to disprove/discredit it. For example: 


1. We contend their current reconciliation is likely below their resource/reserve model by 


around 50%.  Asanko has mined 2.5Mt of ore, 1.3Mt of which has been processed and 1.2Mt 


is on stockpile with grades reported.  Asanko should know what benches the ore has come 


from and the associated resource blocks, they can disprove this claim easily.  We do not view 


this quantity as immaterial or premature: 2.5Mt matches the total ore tonnage Asanko was 


scheduled to process in their DPP to produce ~190koz of gold in 2016. 





2. We have shown 11 cross sections in our report and interpret that the Company’s resource 


shell volume is too large to be able to contain an average grade of ~2.3g/t.  The Company 


should be able to produce cross sections along strike from their resource model showing their 


resource blocks with drill assays overlain. In doing so, they can demonstrate that there are 


not an unusual amount of NSR/marginal grade intercepts surrounded by high grade blocks as 


we perceive there likely are. 





3. We claim the additional drilling performed by PMI does not justify the >4x increase in gold 


that occurred from PMI’s initial 2010 resource estimate to the current one.  It is our 


understanding that PMI previously published their dataset to www.corebox.net allowing 


investors to evaluate the drilling model.  Asanko can do the same and allow investors to 


independently evaluate this. 





4. In our report, we estimate that the company is likely mining ore faster and deeper than the 


DPP planned for in 2016, suggesting they should be outperforming their DPP mine plan rather 


than underperforming it in accordance with their guidance.  The Company can easily refute 


this by comparing the ore tonnage and grade that their reserve model estimates for the 


benches they have mined to date, and plan to mine for 2016, to their DPP mine schedule.

Asanko’s Rebuttal of K2 Report (Our responses below in red) 


1. Asanko Rebuttal: K2 omits to mention that in comparing Asanko’s 2014 MRE 


with an estimate developed 17 years ago by a former owner, Resolute, there has 


been a substantial increase in information gathered from subsequent drilling at 


depth.  


1. K2 Reply: We do not omit mention of this.  In fact, on the first page of section 1 in our report 


we mention 3 times the number of additional PMI drill holes used to produce 3 incremental 


resource estimates post-Resolute. 


2. Asanko Rebuttal: This information, which wasn’t available to Resolute, clearly 


contradicts prior assumptions that the Nkran deposit was becoming thinner and 


more discontinuous at depth. 


2. K2 Reply: This was not an assumption; it was a statement of actual mining experience by the 


previous operator (Resolute). Furthermore, our thesis is not that ore zones will worsen below the 


Resolute pit; our main point is that Asanko’s mineral reserve estimates imply that they expand 


dramatically in terms of ore tonnage per vertical meter beneath the old pit, which we do not 


believe to be the case. 


We explain this further in response to the Company’s mistaken rebuttal of our strip ratio analysis 


later on (see K2 Reply #9). 


If Asanko believes that the drilling clearly supports the over 4x gold increase that occurred 


between PMI’s initial 2010 resource estimate and their current one, then they should make it 


clear to investors by providing them with cross sections and full drill assay data.  In the 821 pages 


between Asanko’s 2014 CJM resource and their DPP NI 43-101 Technical Reports, we found only 


2 cross sections, and neither appeared to be properly oriented perpendicular to strike.  In 


comparison, PMI included 10 proper cross sections along strike in their 2010 Nkran resource 


estimate and, to our knowledge, put their project on www.corebox.net for investors to 


independently evaluate.  We encourage Asanko to match the level of transparency afforded to 


investors by their predecessor. 


3. Asanko Rebuttal: In fact, Asanko’s 2014 MRE has the benefit of an additional 


37,452 metres of drilling, which K2 has ignored, and which informed the MRE and 


Plan.  



http://www.corebox.net/
3 | P a g e  
 


3. K2 Reply: The suggestion that we ignore additional PMI drilling is not true. To make this clear, 


we stated the following in the opening sentences of Section 2 of our report:  


“We plotted all the Resolute and PMI drill data we could locate into 11 cross sections” 


We further include 2 source files of drill data on our webpage (www.asankoreport.com) which 


include 75 PMI holes used in our analysis. PMI holes are clearly represented in cross sections 


within our report.  


4. Asanko Rebuttal (Cont’d from above): The additional drilling, conducted 


between 2007 and 2012 by PMI(2), represents an approximate 50% increase in total 


drilling and a 97% increase in the diamond drilling within the Nkran deposit over 


that which Resolute had available. 


4. K2 Reply: We included this drilling and fully considered all reported PMI holes on Sedar from 


this period. 


5. Asanko Rebuttal: Of the additional drilling, 34,059 metres (91%) was drilled 


below Resolute’s old floor for the Nkran open pit to verify the grades and continuity 


of mineralization at depth. In contrast, of Resolute’s total drilling, only 16,235 


metres (22%) was completed below the old pit floor. 


5. K2 Reply: PMI previously released a dataset of drill holes containing “Significant Composite 


Drill Intersections Under the Nkran Pit” on February 4th, 2010. The link in the release is no longer 


active, but we have posted the file on our website for download. This included 25.6km of drilling 


in 96 holes by Resolute, as opposed to the 16.2km of drilling cited by Asanko.  


Regardless, total meterage is a near-meaningless statistic to observe in isolation without 


providing proper context.  Large quantities of both Resolute and PMI’s drilling were performed 


in areas outside Asanko’s current mineral reserves.  Furthermore, a large quantity of the drilling 


PMI did in mineral reserve areas appears to have been confirmation and infill drilling of previous 


Resolute holes.  For investors to evaluate the impact of drilling, they need to see cross sections 


to gauge the incremental impact of additional drilling, which is why we assembled our own and 


performed this analysis. 


6. Asanko Rebuttal: Moreover, PMI’s data is superior to Resolute’s because PMI 


has relied exclusively on diamond drilling, whereas only 52% of Resolute’s data was 



http://www.asankoreport.com/
4 | P a g e  
 


from diamond drilling. The balance of Resolute’s data was from reverse circulation 


drilling, which provides less useful results. 


6. K2 Reply:  The drilling that Asanko should be comparing is the drilling that took place beneath 


the old Resolute pit where their mineral reserves predominantly exist.  Of the Resolute holes 


released by PMI that encountered “Significant Composite Drill Intersections Under the Nkran 


Pit”, 23.7km of the 25.6km total drilling was classified as diamond drilling (93%), as opposed to 


reverse circulation. 


7. Asanko Rebuttal: K2 also omits proper context in describing Resolute’s decision 


in 2000 to reduce its global mineral inventory for the mine to 749,000oz of gold. K2 


incorrectly implies that the gold was removed from the resource because it was not 


actually present. In fact, the gold was present, but it was made temporarily 


uneconomic by factors that are no longer relevant, such as increasing ore hardness 


(which vastly reduced the throughput of Resolute’s mill) and the then prevailing 


weak gold prices. Asanko’s newly constructed process plant has been designed for 


the hardness of the ore that Resolute encountered towards the end of its 


operations. Moreover, the gold price assumed for Asanko’s 2014 MRE was 


US$1,300/oz, up 400% from US$260/oz around the time of Resolute’s mineral 


inventory reduction. (3) 


7. K2 Reply: This may be true.  Admittedly we were only able to assume what led to the decline 


as we could not find an explanation in the filings available to us. 


However, there is a more recent and relevant reference point, and one that Asanko excludes 


mention of.  PMI re-estimated the Nkran Resources using Resolute’s dataset as well as 10 PMI 


holes in 2010, and came up with only 832koz @ 2.53g/t.  Months after publication of the related 


NI-43-101 the Company changed CEO’s and changed to engineering firm SRK and, using 51 


additional holes that our analysis suggests are mostly infill, they produced a re-estimate within 


~1 year containing over 4x the gold (3.4moz) @ 2.26g/t. 


We evaluated associated differences in grade cut-offs, depth, and drill intersections and, in our 


opinion, they do not account for the scale of the increase. 


8. Asanko Rebuttal: K2’s short report is seriously flawed because its anonymous 


authors have purported to develop an alternative resource estimate without
5 | P a g e  
 


having access to the necessary and extensive analytical, geological and structural 


databases that Asanko’s Qualified Persons used. No K2 personnel have visited the 


Asanko Gold Mine or had discussions with the Asanko technical team. 


8. K2 Reply:  We requested multiple times to speak with Asanko’s technical team.  It was not 


facilitated by management; we remain open to a discussion with their technical team. 


9. Asanko Rebuttal: K2 criticizes Asanko on the grounds that its estimated Nkran 


pit strip ratio is too low but K2 has misstated that ratio as being 3.88:1 when in fact, 


Asanko’s life of mine strip ratio for the Nkran pit is a much more conservative 


5.24:1, as disclosed in the Plan. 


9. K2 Reply: We do not misstate Asanko’s strip ratio as 3.88:1.  Instead we point out how Asanko’s 


DPP models potential Whittle pit designs up to 114Mt in size (which is 3x the tonnage that 


Resolute reportedly mined from Nkran) while maintaining lower strip ratios than Resolute 


achieved (3.88:1). This suggests that Asanko’s mineral resource/reserve estimate sees the ore 


body becoming significantly wider/more continuous directly beneath the old Resolute pit 


without compromising grade. 


This is one of the most important points that we make, and we will therefore clarify it below: 


 Whittle pits model increasingly larger pit design options, testing the contents and 


associated economics of each one searching for the optimal pit size 


 Each Whittle pit design is a representation of what the Company’s mineral reserve 


estimate suggests are possible for them to achieve at different pit sizes, providing a very 


useful window into their mineral reserve estimate 


 Asanko modelled 40 Whittle pit shells in their DPP, they selected Shell #34 which implied 


a strip ratio of ~5.2:1; we are well aware of this 


 We are not concerned with the specific shell they selected, but the implications all of their 


shells make on the underlying reserves 


Below we show what Asano’s Whittle pit shells look like on a scatterplot, comparing total pit 


tonnage (pit size) and the resulting strip ratio (ratio of Waste:Ore within the pit design):
6 | P a g e  
 


Data Source: Asanko Gold Mine – Phase 1 Definitive Project Plan; Graph created by author 


 Asanko’s Whittle pits model a virtually linear rate of increase in strip ratios as a 


consequence of choosing larger pit designs that access more ore at the expense of 


requiring more waste to be mined 


 Asanko is continuing where Resolute left off previously, expanding their already mined-


out pit to mine deeper down the same ore body.  If that same orebody yields ~linear rates 


of strip ratio increases as larger and larger pits are designed, then Asanko’s strip ratio 


should continue on from what Resolute left off at in similarly linear fashion 


 Asanko’s Whittle pit strip ratios curiously do not continue from where Resolute left off. 


Instead, they take a dramatic step function from Resolute’s 3.88:1 average, down to 


roughly 2.07:1 in shell #1, and trend up from there. They do not reach Resolute’s 3.88:1 


average strip ratio until shell #21, at 114Mt of total material. 


 Cut off grades don’t explain this phenomenon, as the grades of Asanko’s estimated 


Whittle shell designs actually commence at higher grades than what Resolute achieved 


 The only explanation we can conceive is that Asanko’s mineral reserve estimate assumes 


the orebody expands dramatically beneath the old Resolute pit, with significantly more 


ore per vertical meter at reserve grades than what Resolute encountered directly above 


We can test our logic by applying our contained gold estimate to Asanko’s Whittle shells. If 


adjusting Asanko’s Whittle shells for the implications of our contained gold estimate results in
7 | P a g e  
 


Whittle shells more consistent with Resolute’s strip ratio, it is evidence that Asanko is assuming 


significant additional ore continuity and/or volume that conveniently begins immediately below 


the old Resolute pit.  


In our report, we estimated that there is roughly only half the gold present compared to Asanko’s 


mineral reserve estimate.  We know Resolute was able to mine at reserve grades above 2g/t, so 


our work predominantly suggests that half the tonnage is present at the grades Asanko’s mineral 


reserve estimate predicts. 


So, what if we remove half the tonnage classified as ore from each Whittle pit and transfer it 


to waste within each pit design, and add Resolute’s mined tonnage to each Whittle shell?  


 Data Source: Asanko Gold Mine – Phase 1 Definitive Project Plan; Graph created by author 


When we remove half of the ore tonnage in each of Asanko’s estimated Whittle shells, the step 


function vanishes and the trend line snaps back to approximately linear from beginning to end in 


accordance with what we would expect – suggesting that Asanko is assuming significantly 


increased ore per vertical meter, which conflicts with Resolute’s actual mining experience. 


10. Asanko Rebuttal: Investors should ignore K2’s reconciliation attempts of actual 


mining results compared to estimated Mineral Reserves because K2 uses limited
8 | P a g e  
 


pre-production data. The purported reconciliation is premature and not technically 


feasible since K2 has no knowledge of where Asanko actually mined ore within the 


pit or what the corresponding Mineral Reserves data for that mined area was 


projected to be.  


10. K2 Reply: According to Asanko’s disclosures, the Company has now: 


 Mined 2.5Mt of ore from the pit as of June 30, 2016 


o Processed 1.3Mt of that material 


o Assigned stockpile grades to the remaining 1.2Mt 


 Grade control drilled an additional 1.2 – 1.3Mt of ore 


This brings the total to at least ~3.7Mt of ore for which the Company, in our view, has substantial 


data to reconcile against their mineral resource/reserve estimates for corresponding benches.  


That amounts to substantially more than a full year of ore processing requirements. We are 


curious as to how Asanko considers this insufficient for reconciliation purposes.   


We encourage investors to contact independent experts who perform resource reconciliations 


for gold miners, as we have done, and ask them how much tonnage they would need to have 


mined/processed/grade control drilled to feel confident in reconciliation to 


resources/reserves. 


11. Asanko Rebuttal: Investors should also ignore K2’s prediction of production 


shortfalls, which is based on the same badly flawed reconciliation analysis. 


11. K2 Reply: Asanko already guided a production shortfall when they lowered their 2016 annual 


production guidance to 140-155koz from the DPP schedule of 187koz despite stating in their 


January 27, 2016 news release: 


“The grade control based mine plan for 2016 is expected to be in-line with the 


Definitive Project Plan” 


The fact that this is taking place while at the same time Asanko pushes their mill to process 


substantially more ore than mine plan in 2016 should, in our view, concern investors. 


12. Asanko Rebuttal: Asanko has provided a preliminary mineral resource 


reconciliation in its Q2 2016 Production Results which shows the mine is on course.
9 | P a g e  
 


12. K2 Reply: Asanko’s preliminary mineral resource reconciliation covers only ~257kt of ore, less 


than 7% of the total quantity of ore mined/processed/grade control drilled that they should have 


the data for.  We think the Company should be showing investors the full reconciliation of all 


their grade control and processing data to their mineral reserve blocks if they are to suggest that 


reconciliation is on course. 


13. Asanko Rebuttal: Asanko expects to provide actual mining results and 


estimated Mineral Reserves in Q1 2017 after an appropriate period of normalized 


mining of the main ore zones under the historic Nkran pit. 


13. K2 Reply: There are two main items we wish to point out in response: 


1. Asanko made it clear in their Dec 21, 2015 News Release that they were entering what they 


deemed the “main ore zones” over 6 months ago, and their DPP suggested these were 


supposed to yield significant ore tonnages at reserve grade immediately thereafter. 


Quotes from Asanko’s Dec 21, 2015 News Release: 


 “Mining main ore zones in the Nkran pit” 


 “The main Nkran Mineral Reserves are now being opened up” 


 “we are starting to mine the main Nkran orebody” 


 “During the past few weeks, further mineralized zones of the main Nkran orebody 


have been exposed in places along the western flank of the pit and are available 


to support the ore production levels” 





This corresponded with the Company’s DPP monthly schedule which we have converted to 


graphical form below. It is clear they were supposed to be entering into an ore mining ramp up 


phase at reserve grade in January 2016.
10 | P a g e  
 


 
Data Source: Asanko Gold Mine – Phase 1 Definitive Project Plan; Graph created by author 





Note that in the DPP, the Company was supposed to be producing ~200kt – 400kt per month 


starting in January 2016, and mined grades were supposed to remain approximately at or above 


~2g/t from August 2015 onward. 





Further note that this ramp up was supposed to occur immediately after the Stage 1 and Stage 2 


pre-strip completed, suggesting that these ore tonnage quantities at reserve grade were 


supposed to occur well before the Company ever reached the base of the old Resolute pit, which 


they appear to now reference as the “main ore zones”. 





Less than 3% of the ore mined through June 2016 was supposed to be mined at monthly average 


grades below 1.9g/t.  In contrast, less than 2% of the Company’s reported Q2 stockpiles are 


reported at grades above 1.6g/t.  





This differential is staggering in our view. We believe that Asanko has been mining what they 


initially deemed the “main ore zones” for over 6 months, and reconciliation has been very poor. 





2. We believe that Asanko is now planning to mine below the deepest portion of the old 


Resolute pit in 2016.  It is our understanding based on Company diagrams that this pit floor 


occurs at roughly 32mRL and, furthermore, that they are not actually supposed to be mining 


beyond these depths this year in accordance with the DPP (see the Company image below).

Source: Asanko Gold Investor Presentation; Annotations by author 


If they are indeed mining deeper than the DPP depths, we view this is highly significant.  Company 


imagery from their May 11 Technical presentation suggests they estimate over 100kt of ore and 


over 7koz of contained gold per vertical meter immediately below the deepest portion of the old 


Resolute pit (below ~32mRL).  Every meter they mine into these areas should, therefore, be 


pushing their mined gold performance meaningfully in excess of their mine plan for 2016. 


14. Asanko Rebuttal: While K2 briefly discussed its purported reconciliation with 


Asanko’s CFO before publishing its short report, K2 did not correct its purported 


reconciliation even though Asanko advised K2 of the analytical flaws. For this and 


other reasons, Asanko is firmly of the view that K2 is acting recklessly in pursuit of 


its short-selling objective. 


14. K2 Reply: The Company provided no data or explanation that countered our thesis.  They 


simply suggested our work was like trying to compare apples with oranges.  The apples and 


oranges presumably being their DPP mine plan schedule along with our drilling data model, and 


their actual production results and guidance to date.  We disagree with the Company on this 


matter, and remain open to changing our view should they provide information that affects our 


thesis.
