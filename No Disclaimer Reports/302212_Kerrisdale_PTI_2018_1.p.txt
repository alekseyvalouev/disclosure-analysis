5/21/2018 Carson Block: Short Standard Chartered Debt - MoneyBeat - WSJ


https://blogs.wsj.com/moneybeat/2013/05/10/carson-block-short-standard-chartered-debt/ 1/2


Carson Block’s latest short play: the debt of Standard Chartered Bank.


Block, founding partner of Muddy Waters Research, made his name with bearish calls on a
number of companies operating in China, most notably the timber company Sino-Forest.


At the SALT hedge-fund conference in Las Vegas, he said he is now betting against London-
based Standard Chartered debt by buying five-year credit-default swaps. “It’s 85 basis points.
This is one of the tightest financial institutions there is… This is cheaper than all those too-big-
to-fail institutions,” he said, adding that “the market misunderstands the amount of risk that’s
presently in [Standard Chartered’s] loan book.”

In addition to the price, another reason Block likes the trade is as a way to gain from the
slowdown in China.


“I’m willing to bet, I’m certainly willing to bet 85 basis points, that when China unwinds, the
correlation in [Standard Chartered’s] loan books…is very high,” he said.
