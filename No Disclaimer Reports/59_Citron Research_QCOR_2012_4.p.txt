   Another Step Towards
Questcor’s Inevitable Endgame
 


 


Today, Citron shares a new key data point, so far
overlooked by Wall Street.  This one is from Prime
Therapeutics, the largest privately-held  PBM in the
United States, as well as a thought leader in
pharmacy bene�t management strategies.  Their
partnership with Blue Cross and Blue Shield covers
20 million people nationwide with an annual drug
spend of $12.4 billion.  Prime recently issued a case
study summary with regard to Acthar Gel
prescriptions.  Its write-up of a study of 30 Acthar
prescriptions states :  “Analysis Finds 96% of Use
Unnecessary“.

This aligns Prime with Aetna’s increasingly
restrictive coverage policies on Acthar, disclosed
just a few weeks ago.

Background


As of yet, despite the span of years Questcor has
had permission to sell Acthar Gel at in�ated prices,
it has accomplished no credible science to bolster
the clinical basis for Acthar use.  Instead, it has
aggressively expanded its sales force to push
Acthar for other grandfathered label indications,
which also lack rigorous clinical proof of superiority
to existing steroid therapy.


Meanwhile, the company responded to Wall Street’s
competitive landscape concerns with an amazing
set of claims that Acthar contains some additional
“secret sauce” ingredients, which are “not well
understood”.  These assertions directly contradict
the label granted by FDA under which Acthar is
permitted to be sold in the US, which state that
Acthar is a medically pure formulation of ACTH.   It
is at the very least a fascinating topic of debate
whether it is legally viable for a pharma company to
make a one set of representations to the FDA, and
other to Wall Street for the same marketed drug.


Prime Therapeutics joins a long list of skeptics
including insurance companies and government
regulators.


 


Is this just a Tug-of-War between Longs and
Shorts?

One way investors have characterized the Questcor
story is that it is simply a “battleground stock”,
locked in a stalemate between longs and shorts.


Citron thinks all investors should consider the
asymmetry of the real data points as to whether
ever higher Acthar sales represents a sustainable
strategy as Questcor’s sole means of revenue.

“I think there’s no demonstrated advantage of Acthar
gel over IV or high dose methylprednisolone …
Whether the drug has other advantages, hasn’t been
clearly demonstrated … We don’t know yet if patients
who failed on steroids would respond to Acthar gel.
That’s not adequately investigated at this point … I
don’t think there’s currently much indication to use
that…”


   Beware reducing this story to
a simple matter of “Citron vs
Questcor”
 


Why won’t anyone talk about the Department of
Justice investigation?  Clearly Questcor
management can’t say anything.  But where is the
analyst community adding value by assessing the
risks?  What is the scope of the investigation?  Does
it go to illegal compensation of physicians?  What is
the geographic scope of the inquiry?   What is the
range of potential impacts?


Fear of losing their one core, yet small market


Tuesday, Citron Tweeted a link to a study presented
at a pharma conference sponsored, ironically, by
Questcor.  The study a�rmed the viability and
e�cacy of less expensive and now medically proven
steroid therapy as an alternative to Acthar, for
treatment of Infantile Spasms.  This is the sole
indication the FDA granted Orphan Drug status for,
allowing Questcor to bring Acthar to market.  That

status was based on Acthar being the only
medically justi�able alternative.


The study highlights again that Acthar, sold under a
label that grandfathered use of ACTH as a drug, still
lacks rigorous clinical testing to justify its use rather
than dramatically less expensive steroid therapy.

   Conclusion
Questcor is not a normal stock with a sustainable
revenue stream based on a market opportunity
stretching unimpeded into the future.  It is severely
bounded by negative trends in insurance
reimbursement, a darkening competitive
landscape, both in new MS drugs and cheap
synthetic ACTH, and vulnerabilities to the regulatory
environment on numerous fronts.  Investors are
cautioned against hanging a conventional multiple
on this stock without consideration of the
endgame.
