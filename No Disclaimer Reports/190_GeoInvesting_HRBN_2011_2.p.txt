NQ Mobile: China Fraud 2.0 
 
NQ is a massive fraud.  We believe it is a “Zero”.  At least 72% of NQ’s purported China 
security revenue is fictitious.  NQ’s largest customer by far is really NQ.  Its real business with 
carriers and SPs is a fraction of what NQ purports.  NQ’s online payment portal does not work – 
it is cosmetic only, designed to make investors think that NQ is a real company.  NQ’s prepaid 
card channel is a bad joke.  We estimate that NQ’s real market share in China is about 1.5%, 
versus the approximately 55% it purports.  We estimate that NQ’s paying China user base is less 
than 250,000, versus the approximately six million it purports.  This fraud and the undisclosed 
related party transactions amount to securities fraud.  We have already provided the SEC with 
information concerning NQ. 
 
NQ’s Antivirus 7.0 is unsafe for sale to consumers, and we consider it to be spyware.  We 
engaged a group of top-tier specialized software engineers to dive deeply into the application’s 
code.  The engineers found that the application creates serious vulnerabilities, making users’ 
phones prone to data compromise and cyber attack by hackers or the Chinese government.  In 
other words, users phones are much more susceptible to compromise or attack with AV 7.0 than 
with nothing at all.  NQ’s applications send far more data than necessary to its server in China.  
This data includes information on all URLs a user visits and location information (among other 
sensitive items).  The uploaded data is not sent securely (let alone in accordance with industry 
standards), despite passing through the Chinese government’s firewall, which is believed to view 
and store all passing data.  NQ sends this data to a third party analytics firm in China.  
Downloads are even less secure.  The application does not require signature, making the phone 
highly vulnerable to third parties uploading malware.  Our engineers successfully staged such an 
attack.  After their analysis, the engineers speculated that these vulnerabilities could be deliberate 
because the techniques vary so widely from industry standards. 
 
NQ’s purported international revenue is even more questionable than its PRC revenue.  A 
leading Android analytics provider estimates that NQ’s global annual app revenue is well under 
$1.0 million.  NQ generates de minimis revenue in the United States.  The agreements NQ has 
announced with various US partners seem to have resulted in attachment rates of only 2% to 3%.  
NQ’s purported days sales outstanding (“DSO”) from are 198 days– much of which supposedly 
comes international revenue.  Even in the most emerging of markets, NQ should be getting paid 
in 30 to 45 days.  NQ’s involvement with Telefónica is massively exaggerated.  It is one of 3,000 
developers on Telefonica’s Blue Via platform.  No developer has ever been expelled from the 
platform. 
 
NQ’s future is as bleak as its past.  Its expansion into gaming and advertising is merely an 
attempt to prolong the fraud.  NQ’s lies about its security app market share have worn very thin, 
and the Company is trying to hide the ball by switching emphases.  Co-CEO Omar Khan offers 
the clearest explanation of why NQ’s expansion will fail.  If NQ were really a “platform” that 
had the lowest user acquisition costs in the world, as Mr. Khan claims, then there could be a 
strategic basis for the expansion.  In reality, NQ’s acquisition costs are closer to being the highest 
in the world, and it should not be called a “platform” with a straight face.  This is merely a way 
to claim to be in a business in which NQ hopes its fraud will be less obvious. 
 


Page 3 of 81
With one exception, NQ’s real management (i.e., those perpetrating the fraud) are sloppy – to the 
point of being comical – fraudsters.  They broke – with flying colors – the cardinal China fraud 
rule of not getting into trouble in China.  NQ was caught red handed by China’s largest television 
news organization, CCTV, installing malware on phones in order to sell them the cure.  In 
addition to that incident, and the subsequent lies NQ tells about it, are illustrative of the type of 
people behind NQ.  In addition to being greedy and willing to engage in illegal behavior, they 
are clearly undisciplined.  That lack of discipline and desperation for real revenue leads them to 
do bizarre things, such as developing a knockoff Segway (we call it the “Family Guardian 
Emergency Response Vehicle”); selling anonymous phone cards in China to phone spammers 
(again, making the cure and the disease); trying to sell a “NQ for Men” app that enables 
philandering; engaging in black hat SEO by likely infringing trademarks of companies such as 
Samsung, Vodafone, and Apple; fabricating virus discovery announcements; and, claiming to 
have paid an outrageous amount ($1.55 million) for its domain.  
 
The one intelligent move NQ made to further its fraud is putting in place the veneer of US 
management – particularly “Co-CEO” Omar Khan.  Were Mr. Khan not fronting for NQ, we do 
not think that investors would have been so willing to overlook so many red flags.  It is unclear 
what Mr. Khan does and does not know; however, he is not a member of the boards or 
management of any of NQ’s China entities.  It is clear that his stock package is worth close to 
$100 million, which is likely far more than he would have earned as a non-C level manager at 
Citigroup.   
 
NQ’s auditor has clearly done a sloppy job.  The auditor failed to ensure that disclosures about 
cash balances by entity are correct.  It classified all cash as a Level 2 asset, which we have never 
seen before.  The auditor failed to ensure that share-based compensation is recorded at the 
correct entity.  It permitted NQ to reclassify significant costs from Cost of Sales to R&D, 
substantially boosting NQ’s gross margin.  The auditor failed to notice that receivables from 
NQ’s largest purported trade debtor, Yidatong, are aged well beyond what the contract permits. 
Having noticed this might have clued in the auditor that Yidatong is really NQ. 
 
NQ’s acquisitions are highly likely to be corrupt.  Analysis of SAIC files of certain of NQ’s 
acquisitions shows inconsequential businesses with very little capitalization.  In some cases, we 
see shareholders of these purported technology companies who appear to be highly unlikely – 
villagers from remote parts of China who do not even have high school education.  In some 
cases, the companies were operating at ghost addresses at the time NQ acquired them.  “Ghost 
addresses” are a major theme in our due diligence on NQ.  A ghost address is not only one where 
the subject company cannot be found, it is one where no business can physically be found –
usually because the address does not exist. 
 
NQ’s cash balances are highly likely to not exist.  Certain purported movements of IPO funds to 
one of NQ’s onshore entities almost certainly could not have, and therefore did not, occur.  The 
classification of all of NQ’s cash and equivalents as Level 2 assets (meaning assets that are 
somewhat difficult to value) raises massive red flags about what evidence of cash balances NQ 
has given its auditor.

The	
  Vast	
  Majority	
  of	
  NQ’s	
  China	
  Revenue	
  is	
  Fraudulent	
  
 
We conclude that at least 72% of NQ’s reported $32.2 million in 2012 China security software is 
fraudulent.1   SAIC financials for Yidatong, its largest customer, NQ’s enterprise and gaming 
companies, NationSky and FL Mobile, show indicia of fraud.  It is therefore likely that very little 
of NQ’s reported China revenue is real. 
 
NQ reported $32.2 million in security software revenue in 2012 from China. We believe that 
NQ’s real security revenue was $2.5 million to $7.7 million (7.8% to 23.9% of reported 
revenue).  NQ purports to generate security revenue in China from three sources: carrier billing, 
which consists of receiving payments directly from mobile carriers and through “Service 
Providers” (“SPs”), direct payment through third party payment services, such as its purported 
partner Alipay; and prepaid cards (which encompass scratch off cards and purportedly also 
activation codes provided to retailers).  (NQ might be preparing to fraudulently claim that 
carriers’ prepaid cards are another payment channel.) 
 
NQ’s carrier billing channel revenue is inflated by at least 362% after eliminating NQ’s 
fraudulent sales to the shell company it secretly controls, Yidatong. 
 
NQ’s largest customer is really NQ.  NQ secretly controls a shell company called Yidatong 
(“YDT”).  NQ claims that YDT is an independent company, and accounted for $20.2 million in 
2012 revenue.  In 2012, NQ’s China carrier billing channel revenue totaled $27.9 million, 
meaning that without YDT’s revenue, the carrier billing channel generated at most revenue of 
only $7.7 million, 72.1% lower than NQ purports.  (This is generous, as we believe that China 
carrier billing was likely no more than $2.5 million.)  After conducting extensive due diligence 
on YDT, we conclude that YDT is an empty shell with no discernable operation whatsoever.  
Further, YDT is really NQ.  Our due diligence process included visiting 10 sites purportedly 
occupied by YDT, all of which were empty or did not exist; studying YDT’s SAIC files and 
financial statements; searching for current and former employees; and reviewing various other 
records.  
 
YDT’s financial statements show that it generated a fraction of the business NQ claims YDT 
does.  YDT’s purported role is a SP (i.e., transaction processor), facilitating NQ’s billing of 
mobile carriers in China.2  For NQ to have generated $20.2 million in revenue from YDT, YDT 
would have to have generated at least that much itself because NQ receives its revenue from 
YDT net of YDT’s margin.  PRC accounting standards mandate that YDT book all funds it 
receives from the carriers as its revenue, and then book the payments to NQ and other clients as 
costs of sales.3

According to SAIC financials, YDT only generated $2.9 million in 2012 revenue, which is 14% 
of what NQ purports to have generated in revenue from YDT.  YDT would have had to generate 
at least the $20.2 million NQ purports to have generated from YDT…to say nothing of the 40% 
of YDT revenue purportedly attributable to other clients.4  YDT’s Cost of Sales account would 
include any amounts YDT paid to NQ and its other customers.  Instead, YDT generated only 
$2.9 million in revenue, and had Cost of Sales of only $1.8 million.  NQ reported accounts 
receivable from YDT of $9.3 million as of FY 2012,5 but YDT’s financials show total accounts 
payable of $3.7 million, once again showing the fraudulent nature of NQ’s financials. 
 
PRC GAAP requires that YDT’s financial statements book revenue gross of payments to NQ and 
other customers.6  The Business Tax (sales tax) of $97,000 YDT paid was a fraction of the more 
than $4.0 million it would have paid if it were generating the volumes NQ claims.  The lack of 
Business Tax payments confirms that YDT’s revenue is shown in its SAIC file on a gross basis.  
Under the PRC tax regime, YDT pays Business Tax on the gross amount of revenue it collects 
from carriers.7  If NQ tries to argue that YDT is just your upstanding tax cheat,8 the argument 
would not hold water.  The parties that purportedly pay YDT – China Mobile, China Telecom, 
and China Unicom – would require Business Tax invoices in order to avoid being taxed on 
monies paid out.  For YDT to generate a Business Tax invoice, it would need to pay the tax to 
the Tax Bureau, which would cause it to show up in YDT’s financials. 
 
YDT’s income statement is below.  It generated far less revenue, and paid far less in Business 
Tax than it would have were NQ’s claims not fraudulent. 
 


	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  	
  
4 NQ claims that YDT derives roughly 60% of its revenues from NQ.  Assuming YDT only has a 10% gross margin 
on NQ business, YDT would generate about $35 million.  See NQ “Response to J Capital Report, NQ: Not at Any 
Price,” August, 2013.

8 “Upstanding tax cheat” is meant to illustrate the cognitive dissonance many investors in China companies exhibit 
when they argue that a given company is not a fraud – it merely cheats on taxes, resulting in understated revenues on 
SAIC financials.

YDT’s balance sheet below shows total payables that are a fraction of what NQ claims its AR 
from YDT were at the end of 2012.  NQ purports that its AR from YDT was $9.3 million. 
 


 
 
YDT is a ghost company (because it is really NQ).  We tried extremely hard to find its 
operations, but were unsuccessful, despite visiting ten different office addresses throughout 
China.  We obtained these addresses from YDT’s SAIC filings, its website, NQ’s SEC filings, 
and other sources.  Five of the addresses were ghost addresses – i.e., it would have been 


Page 8 of 81
impossible for YDT to ever be there because the addresses did not exist.  (Ghost addresses are a 
theme that runs throughout our due diligence on NQ.)  YDT’s offices are either non-existent or 
completely empty.  NQ claims that YDT accounted for roughly 15% of NQ’s Q1 2013 revenue;9 
yet, YDT is clearly incapable of processing meaningful amounts of payments on behalf of NQ 
because it does not have even one employee regularly present to: 
 


• turn on the lights,  
• answer phones,  
• reconcile billing issues with carriers,  
• order office supplies,  
• pay vendors,  
• develop and implement marketing programs,  
• sell services to new and existing customers,  
• handle inquiries from existing customers, and 
• (duties from NQ’s purported contract with YDT): maintain the value-added technology 


platform, technology platform interface; provide verification codes for related products 
and technology support to customers; coordinate with telecom operators to ensure the 
testing and activation of client business; negotiate and communicate with telecom 
operators; maintain the revenue and flow search pages for customers; delete non-existent 
or discontinued users; review customers’ marketing methods; oversee customers’ 
compliance; develop, maintain, ensure stability and responsiveness of the information 
platform. 


(On the positive side, it appears as though YDT’s business model does not call for any human 
resource employees, which is an innovative approach to cost saving.) 
 
We explored several permutations of the address for YDT’s headquarters in Tianjin, before 
finding it in the Tianjin Haosheng Building. Because the lobby directory still had the prior 
tenant’s name plate posted for room 502-2, and the office door located off a narrow, dingy 
hallway was unmarked, we thought it was another dead end.  However, when queried, the 
building’s management office confirmed that YDT did indeed rent room 502-2. 
 
The manager of the building in which YDT has its headquarters said “this is just the registered 
address, but nobody works here…They all work in Beijing it seems, all of them, this is just the 
registered address, this is not their workplace, it’s in Beijing”.  However, the YDT employees do 
not work in Beijing…or Shanghai…or Xi’an…or any of the nine purported YDT addresses we 
found.  YDT is clearly a company trying not to be found.  Below is a summary of our site visit 
attempts and findings.  Actually, it is not really a company – we suspect that the meager revenue 
and expenses it did show were run through its books for reasons unconnected to its purported 
operations.

Previously the address for No. 41 was 
No. 3. No. 41 is now a kindergarten; 
prior to that it was a technical school 
and a middle school.  The office of 
the Community Residents’ 
Committee located nearby never 
heard of the company Yidatong and 
one member became borderline irate 
by the suggestion that Yidatong could 
be located at the same address as the 
school.    
 


 
We subscribed to NQ’s paid mobile apps via carrier billing on 17 different prepaid SIMs in order 
to see whether YDT shows up as the SP.  Unsurprisingly, it did not.  The results of our attempts 
are below. 
 


 
 
We understand that the same SP generally handles billing for both prepaid and postpaid accounts 
for a given carrier and city or province. 
 
The days sales outstanding from YDT stood at 167 days at December 31, 2012, despite the 
purported contract between NQ and YDT requiring settlement within 30 days.17  This 
contradiction affirms our conclusion that YDT is a sham counterparty.

45 days. NQ 2012 20-F, Exhibit 10.13, p. 8. 


Page 12 of 81
the contractual requirement is one of several data points we identified evidencing that NQ’s audit 
is materially deficient.  (See NQ’s Filings Make Clear that PwC’s Audits Were Sloppy for the 
discussion of the myriad audit failures.)   
 
The high DSO from YDT does not relate to international (i.e., non-PRC) business, and therefore 
is not subject to payment terms greater than 30 days.  NQ executed an agreement with YDT for 
international business in April 1, 2010 “that provides for up to one calendar month” to pay; 
however, that agreement expired on March 31, 2012.18  Aside from the issue of YDT not having 
an international department, NQ investor relations informs investors that all of YDT’s purported 
revenue is from PRC revenues. 
 
The contracts between NQ and YDT are sham contracts. NQ has executed two contracts for 
domestic business with YDT – one on April 1, 2010 and the other on June 1, 2012.  In addition 
to YDT’s failure to remotely adhere to the payment terms of the contract or provide a staff to 
carry out its purported duties, the following sloppy errors in the contracts exist because the 
contracts were never intended to govern a real business relationship. 
 


• China Telecom was not included in the original contract, it was included in the second 
• In the first contract, there was no mention of who owned the registered users. In the 


second contract, the registered users information and database were owned by both 
parties. 


• The arbitration clause was drafted in a way that could make any arbitration award 
unenforceable because it lacked necessary (and standard) language regarding the 
execution of awards. 


 
YDT’s purported application lineup shows that even if someone were trying to operate it as a 
business, it would fall far short of generating the approximately $35 million total revenue NQ 
claims YDT generates as a SP.  YDT does not appear to represent any remotely in-demand 
products or provide any service of economic substance. A review of YDT’s website shows an 
unimpressive portfolio of 12 products: three e-book readers, two video game simulators, two 
products from NQ, Microsoft’s Mobile MSN, and the ever essential “Network Clock” 
application.  
 
NQ and YDT have a history of suspect financial dealings.  YDT received “advances” from NQ 
each year between and including 2007 to 2011 in amounts totaling approximately $5.0 million.19  
It is stunning that NQ’s auditor has not looked closely at YDT. 
 
The claim that NQ would have needed to work with YDT does not hold water.  YDT is supposed 
to be a “Service Provider” (“SP”), which is a company that the Ministry of Industry and 
Information Technology (“MIIT”) licenses to provide “value added telecommunication services” 
through mobile phone carrier billing.  In the past, SPs aggregated content from mobile “Content 
Providers” (“CP”), and provided it to carriers.  The content was 2G content, such as ringtones 
and SMS alerts.  At the time, CPs had no way beside carrier billing to charge users, and carriers 
did not yet have their own app stores.  Around 2006, China’s SPs began to die out as content

Page 13 of 81
costs went up because the content was more data-rich, and carriers launched their own content 
platforms.  The late 2000s became even tougher for SPs because of the proliferation of direct-to-
CP payment options, such as Alipay.  Alipay generally allows CPs to keep about 95% of the 
revenue, versus 60% to 80% for carrier billing through SPs.  In order to determine how relevant 
the SP model is, we called approximately 300 SPs from a list of 1,800 SPs provided by MIIT.  
Approximately 50% of the SPs are out of business.   
 
All of these facts beg the question “Why would NQ rely on SPs when SPs are dying businesses, 
and NQ could keep more money billing users directly?”  Two more facts make this question 
even more important.  NQ received its own SP license from MIIT in 2007, and thus would have 
no reason to deal through a tiny SP that is in perpetual need of interest-free loans from NQ.20,21  
NQ’s investee company, and as of 2012, wholly-owned subsidiary, FL Mobile, received its 
Beijing SP license in 2010.22 The answer to the question posed is that YDT is not a real 
company.  Its purpose is to assist NQ in defrauding investors. 
 


YDT	
  is	
  really	
  NQ.	
  
 
In August, 2013, NQ blatantly lied to investors about the nature of its relationship to YDT.  NQ 
was responding to a limited circulation research report that raised a number of questions about 
the Company, including its relationship with YDT.23  YDT is one of the worst disguised related 
parties we have encountered in our years of trawling the sewers of US-listed China companies.  
The key is YDT’s 75% owner, Ms. Rong Xu.  Ms. Xu also previously worked at NQ. 
 
YDT is clearly not a separate business from NQ.  Undisclosed related parties are essential 
elements of China fraud. 
 


• As of December 2011, the Guangdong branch of China Mobile showed YDT and NQ 
both as being based at NQ’s Beijing office, with the same phone numbers, and the same 
contact person (Chen An An). 24  
 


• A list of service providers that China Mobile publishes for Fujian province listing of 
Service Providers show that YDT’s telephone and fax numbers are (tel) 010-8565-5555 
and (fax) 010-8565-5518.  NQ’s Chinese webpage lists those very same numbers as it 
main numbers on its Contact page.25,26 
 


• YDT’s email server is the exact same server as NQ’s.

• The landline customer service number YDT provided to the Ministry of Information 
Industry and Telecommunications (“MIIT”) is NQ’s customer service number – NQ 
customer service representatives answer this phone when dialed.27 


 
l Yidatong and NQ gave a Zhejiang government registry the same employee, Wang Qiu, 


as the official contact person.  Wang Qiu must be a NQ employee, as both entities once 
again used NQ’s phone number as the contact number.28  
 


• The company information sheet in YDT’s Shanghai SAIC files gives a NQ email address 
as the email contact: xuying@netqin.com.  (Net Qin is NQ’s former name, and 
netqin.com is one of NQ’s domains.)   
 


• NQ has repeatedly provided interest free loans to YDT totaling approximately $5.0 
million, despite YDT purportedly collecting money from carriers before sending a 
portion onward to NQ. 


 
NQ also blatantly lied about the extent of YDT’s majority owner, Ms. Rong Xu’s, involvement 
with NQ, including the dates on which she became involved with NQ, and when she left.  NQ’s 
response stated the following: 29 
 


• Ms. Xu worked at NQ for less than six months, as marketing director, and then left NQ in 
2007 in order to buy her stake in YDT; 


• YDT is a separate and completely independent business from NQ; and 
• NQ accounts for only 60% of YDT’s revenue. 


 
NQ has taken pains to convince investors that there was no overlap between Ms. Xu’s time at 
NQ and YDT.  In reality, Ms. Xu’s involvement with NQ is not just overlap – it is entanglement.

• Ms. Xu became involved with YDT far earlier than when NQ claims she left.  In 


February 2006, Ms. Xu is shown as YDT’s Executive Director – over one year before 
NQ claims she left in order to join YDT.30    (Executive Director is the title commonly 
used when a company is small and only has one director.) 
 


• Ms. Xu was director of a company that came to own 25% of NQ in 2006.  In November 
2006, a company of which Ms. Xu was (and still is) a director, Yiteng Beijing 
Technology Co. Ltd. came to own 25% of NQ.31  One of the other Yiteng directors and 
shareholders is Ma Jun.  Ma Jun is Ms. Xu’s co-shareholder at YDT.   


 
It is important to note that one of the present Yiteng shareholders is NQ co-founder Mr. 
Xu Zhou.32  Mr. Zhou and Ms. Xu appear to have an exceptionally close relationship, 
which is essential to understanding her ongoing entanglement with NQ.  Strangely, the 
month after Yiteng became a shareholder, Yiteng transferred its ownership to Mr. Zhou 
and three other individuals.  We do not know how to interpret these actions, but it is clear 
that Ms. Xu is part of the inner circle of NQ, and not just the marketing advisor NQ 
claimed.  One theory we have is that these people were figuring out how to structure the 
NQ fraud, and had a number of fits and starts. 
 


• Ms. Xu became YDT’s Legal Representative in February 2007; however, NQ awarded 
her stock options for her “services” in a company that was not established until March 14, 
2007.33,34 


 
• Ms. Xu was still a Senior Vice President at NQ well into 2008, approximately one year 


after NQ claims she left.  A May 20, 2008 Sina.com news article about Red Cross benefit 
for earthquake victims shows a picture of NQ Senior Vice President Ms. Rong Xu.  She 
was holding up a NQ sign as presented a donation.

As shown in the graph above, Ms. Xu is involved in three companies with NQ co-founder and 
director Zhou Xu.  It appears that Mr. Zhou and Ms. Xu presently share office space – we found 
an employment ad 9H placed in August 2013 in which the workplace address is the same as Mr. 
Zhou’s office at Jingxiu.  The two had an endearing microblog exchange just prior to NQ’s IPO: 
 


Mr. Xu Zhou, 5/3/2011:   
 
Dear brothers and sisters, after sharpening our blade for ten years, today we entered 
NYC, my heart is pounding, awash in emotion, the great dream in my heart, friends 
fighting together shoulder by shoulder, there glorious future is before us, and in ‘13  you 
will see 9H. 
 


Ms. Rong Xu reply, 5/4/2010:  
 
5/5, IPO day in New York, overflowing with excitement, the red five-starred 
banner waving in the wind, and the traders are grinning. Family and dear friends 
lend support, keep the price up throughout the night, keep the numbers across 
screen continuously flashing green.  We are rejoicing.  We are moving down the 
path to success, a brilliant future is dawning - -- 9H is next, go go go! 


 
In reality, NQ’s carrier billing channel generated $2.5 million to $7.7 million in 2012, versus the 
$27.9 NQ purports. 
 


NQ’s	
  Third	
  Party	
  Payment	
  Channel	
  is	
  Non-­‐Existent.	
  
 
NQ’s third party payment channel is non-existent and its China payment portal is purely 
cosmetic.  We therefore extrapolate that this channel provides no revenue to NQ.  We tried 59 
times to make payments to NQ through third party payment services via NQ’s payment portal 
(http://pay.nq.com), such as Alipay, TenPay, and banks between September 26th and October 
18th.  We were unsuccessful each time.  (Note that Alipay and Tenpay are China’s two largest 
third party payment services.) 
 
We called Alipay and TenPay customer service twice for assistance, and none of them were able 
to make NQ’s payment portal work.  They all confirmed that the problem is with NQ, not their 


Page 17 of 81
service.  Alipay customer service stated that NQ is not a partnering merchant, which contradicts 
NQ’s claim that it partners with Alipay.35 NQ also claims that Yeepay, which is not shown on 
NQ’s site, is a payment partner.  Yeepay confirmed that NQ is not a partner either.  It is easy for 
businesses in China to open accounts with Alipay and Yeepay, and we are left to conclude that 
NQ deliberately avoids doing so.   
 
The NQ payment portal’s lack of functionality is clear affirmation that NQ is a fraud.  The 
cosmetic portal calls to mind John Hempton of Bronte Capital’s exposé of Universal Travel 
Group (de-listed, formerly UTA).  UTA had claimed to be one of the largest online travel 
booking sites in China.  In reality, it was a Zero.  Hempton attempted to use the slick-looking 
website to book travel, but was unable to complete his purchase because the website had no 
functionality.  It was also purely cosmetic, and designed to fool US investors into thinking the 
business was real.  NQ’s portal appears to serve the same purpose – to provide legitimacy at a 
glance to investors and to its auditor.  It does not process payments, and NQ’s customers have 
not noticed because, by and large, they do not exist. 
 
In committing fraud, it can be almost as important to avoid legitimate transactions as to record 
fake ones.  We theorize that the reason NQ’s payment portal does not work is that it would make 
it more difficult to fool its auditor if NQ were receiving legitimate payments from these payment 
processors, but in the trifling amounts that NQ would generate.  If NQ is showing its auditor 
forged transaction documents from these payment processors, tiny monthly payments from the 
same payers hitting NQ’s account might get the auditor’s attention.  Bernard Madoff claims to 
have executed no real trades in his fraud – likely for this reason.36 
 
Alexa data evidencing minimal traffic to the payment portal shows that nobody besides short 
sellers noticed the problem, despite NQ claiming to have approximately six million paying 
customers in China.  We did not find any versions of NQ apps that allow for payment through 
third party payment processors.  It is extremely unlikely that NQ has partnered directly with 
banks for payments because that would put NQ further ahead of most of China’s third party 
payment processors. 
 
We therefore extrapolate that the third party payment channel generates an immaterial amount of 
revenue for NQ. 
 
NQ’s claims that its security apps are on approximately 55% of smart phones in China is patently 
false.37  Two independent market research firms have pegged NQ’s market share as less than 
35% - often much less.38  Our own surveys conducted in three Tier 1 cities, one Tier 3 city, and 
one Tier 4 city, yield market share of only 1%.  We estimate that NQ has no more than 250,000 
(300 million smart phones times 1.4% times 50% active user ratio times 10% paying user ratio 
paying users in China, versus the approximately six million it purports to have.

The purported combined amount of third party processor and prepaid card revenue in 2012 was 
somewhere between US$4 million to $10 million.39  NQ does not break out how much was 
attributable to cards, versus third party channels.  (Transparency is the enemy of fraud.)  We 
concluded that third party payment channels contribute immaterial amounts of revenue.  We 
conclude the same for NQ’s prepaid card channel. 
 
Prepaid cards consisted of scratch off cards and activation codes.  Based on NQ customer 
service’s difficulty in directing us to prepaid vendors in major cities, and our pre-installation 
channel checks, which show minimal penetration for NQ, we are skeptical that many (if any) 
retailers in China have access to NQ’s access codes via automated systems or DVDs.  Moreover, 
after we found the cards, we discovered that NQ only allows an account holder to use a prepaid 
card one time before being converted to carrier billing.  That fact alone ensures that prepaid card 
revenue is insignificant.

We made four calls to customer service to inquire about where to buy prepaid cards in Beijing, 
Shanghai, Shijiazhuang (a large city near Beijing), and Guangzhou.  In every case, including for 
Beijing (NQ’s headquarters), customer service was unaware of whether there were sellers in 
those cities, and if so, who they are or where they were located.  Prior to October 14, 2013, 
customer service was willing to go the extra mile to help find them, in two instances we received 
follow up calls/texts from customer service with more information.   On October 10th, we 
received a text back from NQ customer service advising us of the location where we could buy 
the cards in Guangzhou.  We received a separate call back from NQ’s customer service regarding 
the Beijing distributor’s retail location.  We were told that the Beijing vendor is the only seller in 
the city, and that no distributors were operating in Shanghai or Suzhou.  Additionally, their text 
message informed us that the Company was just in discussions with a distributor in Shijiazhuang 
(Hebei province) but that they were not able to sell cards at this time. 


Despite apparently being NQ’s exclusive vendor in Beijing, the seller is located in a spartan 
kiosk (B 1088) in the basement of a computer mall in the Zhongguancun section of Haidian 


Page 20 of 81
District, Beijing.  (Of note, NQ’s registered addresses for the WFOE and VIE are also in 
Zhongguancun.)  This seller sells no products or services except for NQ cards, although the stand 
appears to be under common ownership with the kiosk on its right, which sells HTC, Android, 
Samsung, Sony, and Apple products.  
 
Whereas the Beijing seller’s kiosk embraced a minimalist aesthetic, the Guangzhou seller looks 
like a Costco, featuring a virtual cornucopia of products available for sale.  The Guangzhou 
seller occupies a roughly 100 square foot stall in a computer mall on the first floor of the Haiyin 
Center in Guangzhou’s Dongshan district, but every square inch is packed with merchandise, 
most of which is jewelry, scarves and cell phone accessories staffed by a father/daughter team.

We interviewed both vendors about the prepaid cards and learned that neither sells very many 
cards, and neither thought there were other vendors nearby.40  The Guangzhou seller said she 
was not sure whether there were other distributors nearby, but did not think that many other 
retailers would be interested in selling these cards because the profit margin is low. 
 
The Beijing seller echoed the Guangzhou seller, stating that while there were some sales, they do 
not sell a lot, and not for much profit.  Mr. Zhang, the vendor, indicated people who do buy tend 
to be customers who already knew the product. Potential customers look and leave, apparently 
because they do not seem to understand the product. When asked how they came to sell NQ’s 
prepaid cards, Mr. Zhang explained that they are old friends of the family, and they do it to “help 
them out”.

throughout a marketplace and to other similar markets as well.

The one-year prepaid NQ card (above, left) is a dead giveaway that hardly anybody ever buys 
these cards.  The sell thru rate of these cards appears to be very low as the cards on the left still 
bear the old logo.  NQ announced its new logo on June 11, 2011; therefore, these cards are well 
over two years old.41 
 
The RMB 13 cards contain an interesting clue.  The bottom left corner (difficult to see in the 
photo) contains the logo for the company that owns the kiosk, Beijing Huahui Yunzhen.  Huahui 
appears to be a tiny company, yet NQ printed up numerous cards with that logo.  That indicates 
that as insignificant as Huahui is, it occupies a rarified place in the pantheon of NQ’s business 
partners. 
 
While conducting this research we learned that NQ produces prepaid phone cards for China 
Mobile that enable anonymous calling – these are most likely to be used by telephone spammers.  
(See The Farcical Side.)  On the right of Mr. Zhang’s display case are branded prepaid NQ app 
cards, and in the middle are the unbranded anonymous calling cards.  
 
NQ’s lack of physical presence and virtually non-existent effort to update its merchandise, or 
build out its retail distribution are a clear sign their fraud is not focused on Chinese consumers, 
but rather US investors. 
 
We proverbially poked NQ with a stick in the prepaid card area in order to observe how it reacts.  
As we expected, the reaction was interesting.  An investor recently asked NQ investor relations 
(on our behalf) for names and addresses of some card and code resellers to secretly shop.  At the 
same time, we were regularly calling customer service asking for card vendor information.

impression is that customer service gets few calls overall, and that calls about prepaid cards are 
far rarer.  Investor relations had seemed willing to arrange appointments with purported vendors, 
but as any investor who was burned in companies such as China Biotics and China 
MediaExpress will attest, such prearranged meetings can easily be frauds as well.  The investor 
responded by asking for names and contact information so that we could secretly shop the 
vendors.  Investor relations has not responded. 
 
After asking investor relations for information on China prepaid card sales and sellers, customer 
service began refusing to discuss prepaid cards.  October 14, 2013, we called customer service 
again to inquire about card sellers in other cities.  The service representative said to us that they 
only provide technical support for the products and do not engage in sales, instead kept referring 
the customer to other sales channels.  While on the surface this response appears relatively 
benign, their prior willingness to help check, identify, and contact us through follow-up 
communication was noticeably absent.  We believe this was a result of a corporate directive to 
forbid further disclosure of details on the Company’s prepaid card distribution (or lack thereof). 
This lasted for a few days.  Then customer service changed its tune again, urging callers to buy 
prepaid cards for China Mobile, China Unicom, and China Telecom to pay for NQ apps.  We 
believe that NQ was preparing for being exposed as having no real prepaid card sales by being 
able to retort “You do not understand our business; prepaid cards also include carriers’ cards”.  
To the extent this is true, it is a payment method only a few days old.

Taobao Marketplace is owned by Alibaba, and is a very large, reputable website in China similar 
to both Ebay and Amazon.42  It dominates China’s online B2C and C2C markets. We found only 
three sellers of NQ prepaid cards listed on Taobao Marketplace, and we believe two of these 
sites belong to the Beijing NQ Card Distributor.  All three sites show meager sales at best.   
(Consistent with our view that the anonymous phone cards are not a Kosher business in China, 
there seem to be no NQ anonymous card sellers on Taobao.)  One of the sellers, “NQ Card 
Agent” prominently displays a card with the old logo. 
 
Taobao also provides seller data analytics.   Below is the sales data for the three sellers.  Beijing 
Huahui Yunzhen is the kiosk we visited in Beijing. The Beijing NQ card distributor sells not just 
NQ products but also cell phone recharge cards.  Of the prior six months’ 48 reported sales, only 
11 sales were for NQ cards. NQ Card Agent’s Taobao year-to-date sales are only 348.5 RMB, 
approximately $57.13 (fifty seven dollars and thirteen cents).  Performance at their sister 
company was equally dismal. The Guangzhou kiosk has not made a single sale on Taobao since 
April of this year.

A review of rough comparables on Taobao further suggests that the online market for premium 
or even moderately priced mobile phone software for Chinese consumers is very small, and 
pricing is competitive.  (Free-ware remains by far and away the most popular choice.)  Over the 
past month, the number one and number two leading sellers were retailing their paid software for 
just RMB 5 (US$0.82).  Kasperski’s RMB 1.3 (US$0.21) security software managed only three 
sales.  All others posted numbers in low single digits or sold nothing at all.  
 
NQ’s physical and online presence in China is at best anemic. NQ’s inability to cultivate a sales 
ecosystem suggests that neither retailers nor consumers are interested in selling or buying NQ 
products.

Muddy Waters’s survey-based market research estimates that NQ’s actual share of the China 
security app market is 1.4%, versus NQ’s purported approximate share of approximately 55%.  
Based on our research, we estimate that NQ has fewer than 250,000 paying customers in China, 
versus its claim of six million.  (This yields revenue of approximately $2.5 million, versus the 
$32.2 million NQ purports to generate.)  NQ, its competitor QIHU, and some market research 
firms have cited various market share studies that have very different results.  NQ’s latest claims 
are that its share of the China security app market is approximately 55%.  On the other hand, 
QIHU claims that its market share is 70%.43  We came across research by iiMedia that shows 
NQ’s market share is only 7.2%.44  We set out to settle the question of which research (if any) is 
likely to be accurate by conducting surveys of smart phone owners.   
 
Our research shows that NQ’s China market share claims of approximately 55% are ludicrous, as 
are its claims of having approximately six million paying users.  Our surveys of over 800 
respondents from five cities show that NQ’s share of the China mobile security app market is 
only 1.4%.  In contrast, Qihoo 360 Technology Co. Ltd. (NASDAQ: QIHU) has 73.5% market 
share in our survey, followed by Tencent Holding Ltd. (HK: 700) at 15.7%, Kingsoft Corp. Ltd. 
(HK: 3888) at 4.9%, and “other” at 3.8%.   
 
As we show in the pie charts on the next page, NQ’s (lack of) market share was remarkably 
consistent across the Tier 1, Tier 3, and Tier 4 cities.  QIHU is dominant across all cities we 
surveyed, but has given more ground to Tencent in Tier 1 cities than in the Tier 3 and 4 cities we 
surveyed.  Overall, 58.8% of respondents had some form of security, antivirus, or data protection 
software on their phones.  
 
NQ might criticize our survey sample as being too small to be significant; however, this sample 
size is large enough to reject with 95% confidence a null hypothesis of NQ’s market share being 
far, far lower than NQ claims.  The key is the massive delta between what NQ claims and what 
we found.  There is no way to bridge that gap.   
 
NQ might criticize our survey sample as being geographically flawed – in other words, we did 
not conduct surveys in the markets in which NQ is strongest.  This criticism would not hold 
water though.  The product at issue is distributed over the mobile Internet.  There are likely some 
variations in NQ’s market share from city to city, but given the roughly 60 percentage point 
delta, rejecting our findings for geographical reasons would be a de facto argument that there are 
special places in China that are connected to a very different mobile internet.  Moreover, NQ has 
refused to disclose any information on where in China it actually has market share.  A long-
oriented recently investor asked NQ investor relations director Matt Mathison for some – any – 
detail on where NQ’s market presence is strongest.  Mr. Mathison replied that NQ does not 
disclose this information.  (Transparency is the enemy of fraud.)

With NQ refusing to provide any detail on its China markets, we chose three of the four Tier 1 
cities: Beijing (NQ’s hometown), Shanghai, and Shenzhen.  We then chose two cities in 
Zhejiang province as the respective representative Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities: Ningbo and Huzhou. 
We chose Zhejiang because it was the most pro-NQ means we could think of doing the survey. 
NQ previously announced its first major nationwide sales promotion and established an 
agreement with the Zhejiang-branch of China National Postal and Telecommunications (PTAC) 
to pair up NQ software with 3G cell phones PTAC was distributing.45  Ningbo (about 2.5 hours 
drive from Shanghai) has a population of 7.6 million, 3.5 million of whom reside in the urban 
areas.46  Ningbo’s 2011 per capita GDP was RMB 79,500 (Shanghai’s was RMB 82,600).47  
Huzhou (about one hour drive from Shanghai) population is 2.6 million, with an urban 
population of 1.1 million.48  Huzhou’s 2011 per capita GDP was RMB 58,500.49   
 
If NQ wants to dispute our conclusion that it has laughably low penetration rates in China, 
actions speak louder than words.  Investor relations should refrain from hemming and hawing 
about the samples we have taken, and tell us exactly where in China NQ has high penetration 
rates.  Anything else NQ says to try to refute this point is a waste of toner.

Q: Does your mobile phone have any security, antivirus, or data protection software?  (Multiple choice.) 
 


 
 
Q: Which company’s security, AV, data protection app is on your mobile phone?  (Multiple choice, more than one selection 
permitted.)

Q: How was the app installed on your phone?  (Multiple choice.) 
 


 
 
Q: What is your age?  (Multiple choice.)

Note that pre-installations account for only 6.5% of the apps on phones.  On one hand, this 
suggests that pre-installations are irrelevant to market share.  Another interpretation is that NQ’s 
claims about its pre-installations are exaggerated.  Based on our retail channel checks (infra), NQ 
is just as obscure at retail as on users’ smartphones. 
 
NQ’s massively exaggerated claims about its market share started with a Frost & Sullivan report 
from late 2010 or early 2011 (the period during which NQ was in late stage preparations for its 
IPO).50  The Frost report estimated that NQ had 67.7% market share in 2010.  We believe that 
NQ paid for this report, and that the research methodology did not involve collecting data from 
users.  We believe that the methodology instead was a combination of accepting NQ’s data at 
face value, and speaking with industry parties friendly to NQ.  Since then, NQ has primarily 
relied on research from a firm called Sino MR to support its market share claims.  We do not 
believe the Sino MR research is remotely credible, as we are skeptical of Sino MR’s ability to 
manage the conflict of interest – let alone keep a straight face when discussing conflict 
management.

Our examination of 113 phones at various stores across five cities in China concluded that NQ’s 
pre-installation or bundled software channel is close to being non-existent as of Q3 2013 in 
Beijing, Guangzhou, Shanghai, Shenzhen, and Shijiazhuang (Hebei province).  This does not 
mean that this channel did not exist before, but it is actually the behavior of software providers 
such as NQ (the 315 incident) that has resulted in less software being bundled because handset 
manufacturers and operators have realized bundling can damage their businesses. It is also easier 
than ever before to download apps, and some handset manufacturers have their own branded 
apps.  
 
54.0% of the phones we checked had no anti-virus software on them, and only four out of 113 
phones had NQ installed. Two of the phones (Samsung) were bought in Beijing and had 
originally been display phones.  All other phones of the same model in that store had no NQ 
software bundled with it.  All of the NQ bundled phones with the exception of one had also had 
additional antivirus software on it from Tencent.  We therefore theorize that NQ employees paid 
store employees to install the software.
