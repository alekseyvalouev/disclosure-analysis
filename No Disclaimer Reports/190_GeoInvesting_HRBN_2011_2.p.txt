Unmasking The Harbin Electric Buyout Drama

Anyone who has followed the Harbin Electric (NASDAQ:HRBN) buyout drama knows that:


By all evidence HRBN is a fraction of the business enterprise it claims to be. There
have been numerous credible allegations of fraud from various quarters in recent
history. (See links at the bottom of this report to review some of these allegations.)
The CEO, Mr. Tianfu Yang, has been taking all of the logical steps at significant
expenditure of time and expense to pursue what seems to be a legitimate attempt to
take HRBN private at a significant premium to the company’s apparent enterprise
value.
Mr. Yang has diligently worked to keep the stock price up (see Appendix A) by:


Vigorously responding to every negative report or price drop with press releases as
quickly as possible, even during the middle of the night.
Making boiler plate announcements related to the buyout in an almost compulsory
response to market action. Whenever HRBN’s share price drops you can be sure a
press release or some other announcement will follow. Essentially, management
has developed their own plunge protection strategy to support HRBN’s share price.
Asking shareholders to contact their brokers and instructing them not to lend their
shares to short sellers.


Most investors probably don’t realize that HRBN took out a $50 million loan (35 million
USD + 100 million RMB) on November 20, 2010 with terms that would make most loan
sharks blush. Despite the fact that HRBN had $80 million cash and liquid receivables and
inventory that could easily have been pledged as collateral, the bank extracted collateral
from CEO Yang as security for the loan. The loan requires Mr. Yang to:


Pledge collateral in cash or shares should the mark to market value of the initial
collateral drop below 167% of the total loan exposure (about $92 million)
Sign a full personal guarantee to ensure maintenance of the margin and full
repayment of the loan.
Failure to maintain the collateral level allows the lender to take possession of the
CEO’s shares and sell them in open market.

The loan terms required Mr. Yang to post, as escrowed collateral, the greater of 7
million HRBN shares or 200% of the full loan exposure (including principle interest or
about $110 million in collateral). See SECURITY AND PLEDGE AGREEMENT, page 11-
15.


This loan leaves the CEO personally vulnerable to margin calls should the share price
drop below $13.14. Mr. Yang’s Personal Guarantee of the loan and possible margin calls
on the collateral pledged to secure it put his personal assets at risk in the event of a
material drop in HRBN’s market price. In fact, he is not in possession of the vast
majority of his shares (7 million shares) as they are held in escrow as part of the
security for that loan. In other words, it is very much in Yang’s interest that HRBN’s
share price does not drop. Most, if not all, of his personal assets are at risk if it does.


Mr. Yang has been quite successful at supporting HRBN’s share price. During 2010, while
in negotiations for the initial $50 million loan, he was able to generate sufficient investor
interest to support the share price by simply talking about his planned buyout. That easy
strategy fell apart in early June 2011 when the share price dropped to $13.30. In fact, by
June 16, 2011, the shares dropped by over $6 below the margin call level (the red phone
must have been ringing repeatedly at Mr. Yang’s house).


Immediately following the plunge in HRBN shares, Mr. Yang conveniently signed loan
documents and announced that he secured all necessary financing for the buyout. True to
form, the press releases came almost daily afterwards until the stock price finally
stabilized and started to move higher again.


Since that time, as anyone who has followed HRBN knows, Mr. Yang has been watching
the stock closely and responds immediately to any price drop with further press releases
related to the buyout. In one recent case, HRBN was fortunate enough to have its buyout
case touted in an “unrelated company’s” press releases published by DEER on
September 6, 2011. We can’t help but wonder if the press release from DEER really was
unrelated since Ben Wey brought both companies to the U.S. markets


The following chart (click to enlarge image) graphically illustrates our point of just how
effective HRBN’s plunge protection team has been.

The key questions that have arisen during this buyout drama are:


1. Why did the bank making the $50 million loan require CEO Yang’s personal guarantee
and collateral if HRBN is the company management claims it is? If such onerous terms
were required for a $50 million loan what would they be for a loan 10 or 15 times as
large? Can we really accept the notion that the terms for additional financing so much
greater than the original loan would be less stringent? We don’t think so.


2. What end game could there possibly be for CEO Yang if the buyout intentions are not
real? Why would the CEO pursue all of the extensive steps for a buyout at such
significant cost to the company and personal risk to himself?


3. If the buyout intentions are real, why would the CEO work so hard to keep the stock
price up? What is the worst the buyer would face if the stock price drops? A cheaper
purchase price for the buyout?! The company should just leave well enough alone.


4. Why would a healthy company that claims to have over $80 million cash on hand
take a $50 million loan at terms that require the CEO to maintain mark to market
collateral at 200% of the maximum loan exposure and provide a full unlimited
personal guarantee not only for repayment, but for the maintenance at all times of
mark to market collateral of at least 167% of maximum loan exposure?


Now for the End Game
