Dilution	Coming:	Time	Running	Out	for	YRC	Worldwide	Shareholders
Jul.	26,	2011	11:25	AM	ET9	comments
by:	Studioso	Research


In	our	last	article	discussing	YRC	Worldwide	(NASDAQ:YRCW),	we	discussed	the
implication	of	the	company’s	restructuring	plan,	and	the	impending	dilution	resulting	from
the	issuance	of	billions	of	additional	shares.	We	reiterate	our	price	target	of	$0.28	per
share,	based	on	the	calculations	in	that	article.
This	article	outlines	the	progression	with	the	restructuring	plan,	given	the	milestones
surpassed	on	July	22.	We	will	outline	the	number	of	common	shares	that	will	be	created
as	a	result	of	conversion	of	preferred	stock	and	convertible	notes.
1.	Details	of	balance	sheet	restructuring	completed
On	22	July,	YRCW	announced	that	it	had	closed	its	financial	restructuring	plan.	This
involved	the	following:


3,717,948	preferred	shares	were	issued	in	exchange	for	a	portion	of	the	company’s
loans	and	other	debt.
1,282,051	preferred	shares	were	issued	to	the	IBT	Employee	Stock	Trust.
Series	A	notes	($140	million	face	value)	were	issued	to	a	smaller	group	of	the
company’s	lenders.
Series	B	notes	($100	million	face	value)	were	sold	to	investors,	providing	$100	million
in	additional	liquidity.


The	positives	from	the	above	are	that	$1,033,566,247	of	debt	was	canceled,	and	that
YRCW	received	$100	million	proceeds	from	the	Series	B	notes.
However,	there	were	substantial	negatives	for	YRCW	shareholders.	These	are	best
summarized	by	the	following	quote	from	the	company’s	press	release	of	July	22:


“As	a	result,	the	company's	shareholders	at	the	time	of	the	exchange	will	be	reduced
to	holding	approximately	2.5%	of	the	company's	outstanding	stock	and	will	be
subject	to	further	dilution	by	a	proposed	management	incentive	plan	and	the
conversion	of	new	convertible	notes.”


2.	Details	of	actions	to	be	completed
As	discussed	in	the	company’s	S-1	filing	of	May	17,	following	completion	of	the
restructuring,	the	company	will	hold	a	shareholders’	meeting.	In	this	meeting	the	company
will	seek	approval	from	shareholders	for	the	Charter	Amendment	Merger	as	described	in

the	S-1	filing.	This	includes	the	automatic	conversion	of	the	preferred	stock	into	common
stock.	It	is	highly	likely	that	shareholders	will	give	this	approval,	given	that	holders	of	the
newly	issued	preferred	stock	will	be	able	to	vote	on	an	“as	converted”	basis	–	representing
about	97.5%	of	the	company.	A	vote	to	approve	the	Charter	Amendment	Merger	will	also
allow	preferred	shareholders	to	sell	their	(converted)	common	stock	–	the	preferred	stock
is	not	listed	on	any	exchange.


It	is	also	highly	likely	that	holders	of	the	Series	A	and	Series	B	notes	will	convert	their	debt
into	common	stock,	given	that	the	conversion	prices	are	extremely	low	compared	to	the	22
July	closing	price	of	YRCW	shares.


Description	of	convertible	debt Conversion	price


Conversion	price	of	Series	A	notes $0.1134


Conversion	price	of	Series	B	notes $0.0618


Once	the	company	receives	shareholder	approval	for	the	Charter	Amendment	Merger,	the
following	securities	will	be	converted,	or	will	become	convertible:

Series	A	notes $140	million	face	value 1,234,567,901 22	July	2013


(two	years	after	issue


date)


The	following	table	describes	the	increase	in	the	number	of	YRCW	shares	outstanding
based	on	probable	future	events:


Current	shares	outstanding 47,770,650


Shares	outstanding	after	conversion	of	preferred


stock	into	common	stock


1,910,131,449


Shares	outstanding	after	conversion	of	preferred


stock	into	common	stock	and	after	conversion	of


Series	B	notes	into	common	stock


3,528,254,426


22	July	2013,	assuming	conversion	of	all


preferred	stock	into	common	stock,	and


conversion	of	all	Series	A	notes	and	Series	B


notes	into	common	stock


4,762,822,327


Once	shareholder	approval	is	received,	over	1.9	billion	shares	will	be	available	for	sale,
compared	to	the	current	shares	outstanding	of	less	than	48	million.	A	more	probable	share
count	will	be	3,528,254,426	shares,	which	includes	the	conversion	of	the	Series	B	notes.


Given	the	$0.28	valuation	we	calculated,	it’s	highly	likely	most	of	these	new	shares	will	be
sold	shortly	after	conversion.
