Citron Probes the Obvious:  Where are
the Stores?


Amazing how fraud is like water, it just �nds the
path of least resistance.  When Citron started this
column nine years ago this week, the frauds were
OTCBB stock promotions run out of boiler rooms. 
The progressed to internet campaigns and mailers,
and now most recently to the greatest promotion of
’em all:  CHINA.   In this past weekend’s Barron’s
Magazine, Bill Alpert does a �ne job in describing
the web of fraud that exists in small cap Chinese
stocks that were brought to market via reverse
merger.

“The SEC’s enforcement sta� can’t
subpoena evidence of any fraudulent
activities in China, and Chinese regulators
have little incentive to monitor shares sold
only in the U.S. Many reverse-merged
companies admit in prospectuses that they
haven’t gotten required approvals under
China’s �nancial regulations.”


Citron has written about a reversed merged China
stock in 2007  (Xinhua Finance Media
NASDAQ:XFML).  When we published, it was $10.00
and now it is .18 cents (ticker now XSEL).   After
reading this weekend’s Barron’s, we thought we
would share the interesting case of China-Biotics as
it seems so timely and relevant.


While the world “biotics” might sound impressive, it
really is nothing more than a food supplement that
in this case comes in the form of an acidophilus
pill.  Worldwide, there are literally dozens of
manufacturers of the bacteria concentrate in these
supplements.  It is a mature and stable low-margin
industry.


We could probably write 10 pages on what stinks
about this China Biotics and what raises the red
�ags for fraud.


It would be easy to look at the gross
discrepancies between the company’s
SAIC and SEC �lings.
It would also be possible to show
pictures of the half-�nished over-
budget manufacturing facility side-by-
side with company claims that it was
already in production, or the photos
of their current production facilities
the size of a “bathroom” where the
acidophilus pills drop out of a
machine two by two.
Most compelling, it would be simple
to question how a company who sells
the bulk of their product though
distributors, who then purportedly
resell them to Wal Mart (so they
claim) can generate EBIDTA margins

of 40-45% when their competition is
at 27% max.  (Multinational
companies in the business include
Danisco, Yakult, Perrigo, Cargill and
others.)   The company claims its high
margins are due to its “retail channel”.
Or, as if one needs any more of a red
�ag, we could discuss how the
company has been through 5 CFOs in
only 4 years

We could discuss the company’s $50
million plus �nancial commitments
due in 2010 or its looming potential
tax liability from questionable past
�nancial transactions that could also
be as high as another $50 million.


But all of those arguments would either require
Citron to prove a negative or use arguments of
inference.  Or it would require shareholders to
actually use some form of skepticism and analytics
when judging the numbers.  So instead we will ask
an easy question that the company and
shareholders should have no problem answering:


China-Biotics  –  Where are your stores?????


According the CHBT’s SEC �lings,


“As of March 31, 2010, we had 111 Shining
branded outlets in Shanghai and 12 other

major cities in China where we sell our
products directly to the end users.”


Below is a chart showing the company’s alleged
retail store growth since the company completed its
reverse takeover in March 2006.


CHBT disclosed that “about three quarters of these
outlets are located in Shanghai and the rest are
located in 12 other cities in China.” As a result, we
should expect that the company has at least 70
outlets in Shanghai.


Amazing that a company that is not at all shy in its
use of PR’s had this explosive store growth without
one: ribbon cutting, new store pr, or notice of
opening.


Extensive web searches through

http://shanghai.aibang.com/
[http://shanghai.aibang.com/] , and
http://www.mapbar.com/
[http://www.mapbar.com/] using the company’s
disclosed brand names reveal only a handful of
stores.  We can �nd only 6 or 7 stores in Shanghai,
and one each in Xeitu, NanMatou, Jingyu, Zhang
YangLu, LingNan, FengZhuang.


In going through the corporate �lings, it appears
that the company’s retail outlets go under the
brand  益生有益.  That is also the name that we can
see on the sign of the few stores that we actually
could identify.  Put that into http://map.baidu.com/
[http://map.baidu.com/] and see if your results
di�er.


Citron has heard from a handful of investors who
all report that they have been unable to �nd any

sign of even 25 locations, let alone over 100.


The company claims there are more than 100 retail
outlets, with at least 70 of them in Shanghai.
Proving that should be fairly easy: management
should simply publicly disclose the addresses for
every one of the company’s retail outlets.


Since a picture is worth a thousand words, here’s a
look at the store China-Biotics identi�es as its
“�agship”.  There’s very scant inventory, but a lot of
photos of what looks like a sales meeting for an
MLM organization, a business model the company
denies being a part of.   Yet the excuse made by the
proprietor of this store for the obvious lack of sales
is that “most of the sales are generated through a
‘buying club’ “.


NOTE:  MLM sales organizations are strictly
prohibited in China.   See what happened to Avon:

OK, OK … those used to our stringent US disclosure
standards may be asking…”What about the
auditors..– certainly they have seen or have
knowledge of all of the stores, no ? ”


The auditors of CHBT are BDO Limited…..who
should not be confused with BDO Seidman, as all
they really share with that big-name �rm are 3
letters in their name as explained in this article by
China Company Analyst.

paper-not-all-bdos-are-the-same]


BDO seems to have become the auditor du jour for
questionable Chinese public companies.


“Well Citron, what about just going to the corporate
website and getting the locations there?”


You do it.  If you try it on one of those days where
the corporate website actually works (

addresses.  How can any company claiming to be in
the retail business (with over 100 stores) not even
list store locations on their site…anyone, anyone??


Conclusion


Investors need to be wary of the growing scrutiny
that Barron’s and other investigative reports will
bring upon these shenanigans.  Citron doesn’t
believe the current regulatory “enforcement-free
zone” for US-listed China-based companies is in the
best economic interests of either the US or China,
and it is not sustainable.


Within China, the country’s credibility in the
international marketplace is regarded as a national
strategic priority.  It may seem that China’s culture
has di�erent standards when it concerns of
questionable business ethics, but when the state
becomes aware of a real economic threat, they
come down hard.  Just look at what happened to
the CEO’s of companies involved in the melamine in
milk scandal, the lead in toys scandals, etc.  Its no
wonder that the �rst sign a US investor may get of
trouble in a Chinese company is when the CEO
“disappears”.


There’s no need to get embroiled in “shorts vs
longs” battleground rhetoric here.  It’s a very
simple matter:  where are the stores?  If there are
no stores, there’s no margins, no pro�t and
nothing credible about this company or its
management to hang an investment thesis
on….period.


Alpert’s article shows how bad the odds are for
investors in these poorly documented and
regulated reverse-merger entities.  But at the
bottom of the class is a company whose entire
operation is based on �ction.


Cautious investing to all.
