Company 
Promotion


“Leading provider of social commerce solutions

and 30%+ sales and EPS growth”


“Leading provider of HR/Payroll solutions as a 
SaaS solution capable of sustaining 20%+ sales 


growth and margin expansion”


“Revolutionary metal alloy company”


Our Criticism Nonsensical business model, meaningless 
“cohort” analysis, and PowerReviews deal that 


would fail expectations. With extreme 
overvaluation at 9x sales, we saw a long-term 


valuation of $4 - $6/sh on 1.5x-2.5x sales. 


Promotional management that is increasingly 
putting its personal outside business interests 


ahead of ULTI’s, aggressive accounting masking 
margin pressure from commoditization of its 
technology, lack of independence of auditor, 
move towards acquisitions to bolster growth,  


overvaluation 


Highly promoted penny stock with tangential 
connection to Apple.  With a market cap that 


exceeds $125 million, and a convoluted capital 
structure, investors would revalue the business 


to pennies.


Spruce Point 
Successful 
Outcome


Sudden CEO resignation, DOJ files antitrust 
lawsuit and failure to consummate the 


PowerReviews acquisition  Current share price 
at $4 or -75% since publication date. 
The shares have hit our target price.


ULTI recently missed Q4’16 earnings, the first in 
many years. More evidence of margin 


degradation emerged. Recent proxy shows two 
directors (including the audit committee chair)
are not standing for re-election. The Company 
admitted the CEO’s cohabitation with the Chief 


People Officer


LQMT’s shares have languished and its share

exceeded -$34m

Executive Summary
5


Quick Highlights Driving Our “Strong Sell” 
Opinion And 50% - 60% Downside Target: 


WIX.com (Nasdaq: WIX or “the Company) is an Israeli based technology service provider offering a free website solution that depends 


on upselling customers on additional features. With WIX’s share price up approximately 300% in the last twelve months, we believe 


investors are overlooking many issues that could cause a substantial price correction:


• While WIX was an early mover in the freemium website creation model, it is now becoming more competitive with new players and its 


“growth at all cost” strategy through expensive advertising is appearing to plateau. Its customer acquisition costs are rising rapidly as its size 


creates a barrier for additional growth. As a result, we believe its recent deal to acquire DeviantArt represents a potential strategy shift to grow 


through acquisitions, and introduces new risks to its business model that investors should carefully consider. We think WIX’s business is set to 


slow, and investors should look carefully to see that its revenue growth in 2017 will outpace cash collections growth


• WIX’s “unicorn” model appears too good to be true and there are emerging cracks beginning to appear in its financial statements


including subtle revenue and tax restatements, and anomalies in its cost structure. WIX portrays itself as a well oiled machine with world 


record gross margins at 85% and that it will have spent ~$30m on capex from 2010 – 2017 to accumulate >100m registered users, engineer a 


negative churn business that produces $400m of revenues, $1.4 billion of collections, and is worthy of a $4bn market cap. Based on our 


analysis, these results merit scrutiny (e.g. try finding another negative churn business or capex efficient model). The SEC recently issued 


comment letters to WIX questioning its aggressive Adj. EBITDA presentation and its pace of revenue recognition and expense deferral. After 


two EBITDA revisions already, investors should be suspicious, but we believe more revisions may come. WIX is dropping subtle hints in its 20-


F that because it is no longer an “emerging growth company” under Section 404 of Sarbanes Oxley, it will face stricter financial control.


• WIX insiders have incentives to heavily promote its shares and left clues to suggest it intends to dilute with 2-3 million new shares


We estimate its two founders are sitting on $225m of option gains needing to be monetized. Options under the 2013 plan start becoming fully 


vested in 2017. Early venture backers (Benchmark, Insight, Bessemer) have exited and only one initial backer remains. None of WIX’s top 


shareholders are Israeli funds. WIX has lured in retail investors and US funds through repeated Cramer Mad Money episodes. Now that WIX 


Is claiming it has reached a cash flow positive inflection point, and has ample cash on the balance sheet, we find evidence of pending dilution


• Investors should be highly concerned by WIX’s audit situation: Two of WIX’s audit committee members have already resigned since 


coming public (both were non-Israeli based members). The Company’s two local Israeli auditors have a spotty track record of early 


identification of accounting issues, and both have been cited by the PCAOB for audit deficiencies. WIX’s annual audit fees of just $500k are 


miniscule in relation to other SaaS and marketing service technology companies 


• Background of WIX’s CFO Littered With Associations To Questionable Companies: WIX’s CFO has worked at three US listed public 


companies: Alvarion, Veraz Networks and ECI Telecom. Alvarion and ECI Telecom faced fraud allegations, and Veraz was sanctioned by the 


SEC for FCPA violations. Alvarion and Veraz (later merged with Dialogic) drifted to insolvency and delisting 


• Valuation Concerns Becoming Evident: WIX’s valuation is stretched (avg. analyst price target is $72), and they don’t correctly account for 


its significant dilutive share count. At 9.5x and 178x 2017E Sales and Adj EBITDA, WIX is priced for perfection. Investors ascribe a value of 


$1,600 per paying sub. vs. $400-$500 for peers. With average annual revenue per sub at ~$137/year, the current valuation represents ~12yrs. 


of subscriber sales. WIX could lose 20% just on the share count correction, yet we see total downside risk to $36 - $42/sh (50% - 60%)

Capital Structure and Valuation


The Street incorrectly values WIX by not carefully evaluating the dilutive impact of options (which are deeply 


in-the-money). Other analysts fail to value WIX on its restated Adj. EBITDA, which removes the change in 


deferred revenues to comply with the SEC’s new guidance on Non-GAAP presentation.

Are Investors Prepared For Significant 
Dilution Coming….?


Read the fine print. For the first time WIX is giving fully diluted share count guidance and it’s not pretty. 


Buyer beware! The Company has forecasted a ~37% increase in diluted share count.

Dilution Coming…. (Cont’d)


Something isn’t adding up to Spruce Point when evaluating WIX’s substantial diluted share count estimate 


for 2017 of 57 – 58 million shares, or a +37% increase.


We attempted to bridge the gap by considering WIX’s outstanding options and Restricted Stock Units. 


We estimate that WIX may issue 2.3 to 3.3 million shares this year to dilute investors. With its stock price up 


approx. 60% YTD and trading at all time high multiples, investors should not be surprised.


WIX is guiding to $63-$65m of Free Cash Flow in 2017, and has $171m of cash and equivalents, so it should 


not need to raise additional capital, absent plans for a large acquisition. (6)

2. Share price of $61.50 as of Feb 15, 2017 when guidance was offered in the Shareholder Update report


3. Simplified analysis does not take into account tax consequences or assume repurchase of shares which would only decrease outstanding amounts


4. WIX says “As of February 28, 2017, 2,669,134 shares remained available for future grant under our share incentive plans.”  (source: 20F p.76). This figure puts a

Warning: WIX Not Targeting Free Cash Flow


Supporting our view that WIX’s cash flow may not be sustainable, and it may need to dilute shareholders, 


we observe that its recent investor presentation could not offer long-term cash flow guidance. This is at 


odds with WIX promotion of itself a SaaS company with world class gross margins, negative churn, 


limited capex requirements, and highly predictable cohort visibility. 


Why No 


Target?

Easy To Justify A Quick 20% Downside In Price


Sells-side analysts such as Needham has a $73 price target (March 2, 2017)


“Our price target of $73 is based on a 5.8x 2018E EV/Sales multiple, in-line with other top performing 


SaaS companies, which we believe is appropriate given its faster revenue growth rate.”


• WIX is currently trading at approximately 7.3x EV/2018E Sales based on the 


actual fully diluted share count of 57.5m for this year according to WIX


• At $57/share and $135m of net cash and equivalents, WIX’s EV would currently 


be $3.1 billion


• Needham estimates $535m of 2018 sales


• This equates to a 5.8x 2018E EV/Sales multiple in-line with peers according to 


Needham


• At $57/share, that’s approximately 20% downside from the current price


• This analysis assumes nothing else other than diluted shares directly from 


management, and a fair multiple directly from its sell-side broker


• Where are we wrong?

WIX’s Problem: New Entrants 
Seizing Market Share Faster


WIX has a deep pool of competitors including newer ones that have recently seized more market share 


faster than WIX has been able to achieve since 2013. WIX has spent almost $500m in sales and marketing 


and has just 0.7% market share of content management systems. The bulls would say this data shows WIX 


is growing market share, but we say it is fractional share gains and others have achieved more share faster.

Marketing Spend / New Registered User Growth of Regitered Users


WIX’s Problem: Acquisition Costs Exploding, 
Growth Rate Slowing, Discounts Rising


WIX’s business model of “Spend at any cost to acquire users” is showing signs of hitting a wall. The cost to 


acquire an incremental user is exploding. WIX defines its own unique concept: Time Return on Investment 


(TROI), or dollars collected from new subs in period to dollars spent on marketing costs. It needs new users 


to drive premium subscribers. Both New Registered Users and New Premium Subscriber growth rates are 


slowing as its size gets larger.

Marketing Spend / New Premium Subscriber Growth of Premium Subscribers


Declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):  In addition to escalating user acquisition cost, WIX’s ARPU has been 


stagnant from 2014 at $140 to $136 in 2015 and $137 in 2016. Management’s explanation is that it has been selling more 


annual subscriptions at a discounted price – 20% off according to the CEO on the Q3’15 conference call. However, now on its 


website under the questions “What are the benefits of purchasing a Yearly Savings Plan” it is advertising “savings up to 45%”

WIX Affiliate Program


WIX does not discuss much about its “Affiliate” program other than a one sentence disclosure in its 20-F Annual 


Report. Using the Wayback Machine, we find that the Company has boosted its payout by 25% since 2015, which 


further supports our belief that WIX’s customer acquisition costs are rising. 


WIX Current Affiliate Program


Pre- June 2015 July 2015 to Current


WIX Affiliate Program – June 2015


Is WIX Screwing Its Affiliates To Reduce Expenses And Boost Cash Flow?


 That’s the claim by an anonymous poster who provides reasonably good detail of current WIX employees cited 


in the post that can be independently verified to be working at WIX. The timing of the change coincides with 


the payment change noted below:


 “One day, in middle of last year (2015), I received an email from Wix telling me that they will be changing their 


affiliate terms so they will be stopping any payment related to previous agreements by August 2015.”

WIX Problem: Complaints Rising….


According to WIX, support and call center employees fell by 7 people in 2016, while registered users and paying 


subscribers increased by 20 million and 697 thousand. This is a recipe for disaster. WIX’s CEO credits user 


satisfaction to its recent success, but the recent explosion of customer complaints suggests otherwise…. 


CAUSE > Decline in Support Personnel


Source: WIX 2016 20-F, p. 91


Horrendous Service (4/6/17): “Their customer service is the bottom of the 


barrel and they purposefully make it difficult for you to contact them if you 


have a billing or technical issue.”


BBB Product/Service Complaint (4/6/17): “The problem is they don't have 


customer service at all You have to type in your question and they keep 


sending you to there same standard answers If you call to request a ticket 


mind you for a call back, that doesn't happen either How can you have a 


website if you can't get online ordering to function I paid them in full $239.00 


on February 23, and it's now April 4, and still don't have a working website I 


want them to fix the problem or I want my domain name and a full refund”


Short of a Scam Really (3/28/17): “terrible customer support - links that circle 


back, no real support and a fake phone number that sends you back to the 


same link... crazy... call back service is shut down until further notice, no way 


to submit support ticket.... are they going under, or just scamming people”


Terrible customer service (3/15/17) “I was not able to get my site up, so I 


requested a call back from customer service. I wait TWO hours for the call. 


This is after my first call to WIX when I was on hold for 45 minutes before I 


hung up.”


EFFECT > Explosion in Customer Complaints


CEO Abrahami (11/14/15): “I just want to add to what Nir said. It's not just about increasing the value of the cohorts in the 


lifetime value, it's just about user satisfaction.” and “And I think that the overall effect of having more and more segments 


being addressed by us is going to create a major change in the overall conversion and of course, user satisfaction because 


they get a better product, we can do a lot more on Wix.”

WIX’s Solution: Promote An Acquisition


WIX announced the acquisition of DeviantArt on Feb 23, 2017. WIX acquired 40m DeviantArt website members at an 


enterprise value of $39m or approximately $1.0 / member. Although net of member overlap this figure is likely higher, 


but likely substantially lower than the $7.67 / user current acquisition cost. At ~$55/year per member, and $9.6m of 


annual sales, we estimate it had 174k paying members or just 0.4% of total registered members. (1) With such low 


penetration and willingness to spend, WIX will be challenged to mine its member base.


Source: WIX press release


1) DeviantArt pricing


NEW YORK, February 23, 2017 – Wix.com Ltd. (Nasdaq: WIX) has announced that it has acquired DeviantArt, one of the world’s largest 


online communities dedicated to artists, art enthusiasts and designers. The acquisition represents inherent opportunities in key growth areas 


for Wix including product development, brand recognition and increased traffic potential. Wix will provide DeviantArt users easy access to 


powerful tools specifically designed to help emerging artists create and showcase their creativity online and build their brands. At the same 


time, Wix creatives and designers will have access to DeviantArt’s thriving community of tens of millions of visual artists. DeviantArt is 


consistently one of the most visited websites worldwide and has grown organically for over a decade with virtually no investment in marketing 


or advertising. Currently, the community boasts over 325 million individual pieces of original art and more than 40 million registered 


members.


About the Acquisition


Through this transaction, Wix has acquired 100 percent of DeviantArt’s capital stock in exchange for approximately $36 million in 


cash, including approximately $3 million of assumed liabilities. As of December 31, 2016, Wix had $172 million in cash on its balance 


sheet. The transaction closed on February 22, 2017, and will be recorded in Wix’s first quarter 2017 financial statements.


About the Acquisition


• As a result of this transaction, Wix is making the following adjustments to its previous outlook for the full year 2017:


• Increasing its revenue outlook by approximately $8 million to $417 - $419 million


• Increasing its collections outlook by approximately $9 million to $461 - $467 million


• Investments in the platform are expected to decrease FY17 free cash flow outlook by approximately $8 million to $63 - $64 


million. This estimate reflects further investment in R&D and marketing, integration costs, employee retention bonus payments and other


transaction related expenses

Increasing Dependency on 
Stock Price Inflation….


Spruce Point has seen many risk factors over the years, but none as pointed as WIX’s recent 


disclosure about how dependent it is to levitate its stock price…..


"Many of our employees may expect to receive significant proceeds from sales of 


our equity in the public markets after their equity compensation has fully vested. A 


drop in share price due to market fluctuations may reduce their motivation to 


continue to work for us. If we are not able to effectively retain employees, our ability 


to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will 


be harmed.”   


Additionally, liquidity available to our historic employee security holders because of 


our rising share price could lead to disparities of wealth among our employees, 


which could adversely impact relations among employees and our culture in 


general. Any failure to preserve our culture could also negatively affect our ability to 


retain current and recruit new personnel, continue to perform at current levels or 


execute on our business strategy.“

Signs of a Financial Model Too Good 
To Be True And Cracks Emerging
22


Registered “User” Warning


WIX promotes registered users, and defines it in such a way as to make it almost meaningless to evaluate 


its business. All that’s needed is a unique email address and nothing more. There’s no requirement that a 


registered user do a single thing such as maintain active use of the account over any specified period. 


In fact, WIX has even said it has no way of even assessing the level of engagement of a registered user. 


This is baffling given WIX’s substantial R&D expenditures from 2010-2016 and it launched a nifty “artificial 


intelligence” tool for website design, but hasn’t solved the puzzle of tracking users.


The number of our registered users may be higher than the number of actual users, and we have no means of


assessing the level of engagement of a particular user following registration.


We use the definition “user” to mean the number of unique email addresses registered on Wix.com. The number of


users as we define it may be higher than the actual number of users because some users have multiple registrations and others


may have registered under different or fictitious names. In addition, we have no means of assessing the level of


engagement of a particular user following registration. The length of time that users take following registration to


design and publish a website varies significantly from hours to years. Some users may never publish a website, but


have not cancelled their registration. Even if it were measurable, we do not consider the level of engagement of our


registered users to be material to our business. Rather, we consider the rate at which users from a particular period


generate premium subscriptions to be material to our business. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 36% of our premium


subscriptions were purchased by users that registered with us in the same quarter and the remaining 64% were from users who


registered in earlier quarters. Nevertheless, if the number of our registered users is materially inconsistent with the number of


our actual users, our user base, which we believe is important to the growth of our premium subscriptions, may be


overstated. If that is the case, our business may not grow as fast as we expect, and our financial results and business


prospects may be harmed.

World Class Gross Margin: Too Good To Be True?

Servers -- 200 300 400 500 400


1) Recall, the SEC comment letter referenced cost deferrals with the company claiming that  “95% or more of our expenses have historically been incurred when billed or within 30 days thereof”
2) WIX has claimed gross margins increase due leveraging third party providers to effectively manage its hosting costs and scale benefits (source)
3) Defined as annual increase in bandwidth and hosting costs divided by annual increase in registered users 


By analyzing the drivers of annual cost of revenue increases carefully, we have some cautionary observations: 


1. Why did WIX’s bandwidth and hosting costs growth rate decline in 2015 and surge in 2016?


2. Why are the 400 servers disclosed by WIX now falling, after having increased steadily by 100 each year and rapid user growth?


3. Why did domain registration cost increase not keep pace in 2016, and why have incremental registration cost margins increased over time? 


Has WIX been deferring costs early to boost margins? GoDaddy and Tucows report 71% and 76% cost margins. Why is WIX lower? (1)


4. Why did WIX stop disclosing headcount related to cost of revenues in 2016? 


5. When measuring incremental bandwidth and hosting costs per added register user costs are going up. Is this diseconomies of scale? (2)

Capital Investment: Too Good To Be True?


WIX is possibly the most capital efficient business in the history of technology, or simply a business model 


that is way too good to be true? From 2010-2017E WIX will have spent just $30m in capex to create a 


business with >100m registered users, $1.2bn and $1.4bn of cumulative collections and revenues, 


respectively. We’ve looked at gross capital investment per employee of WIX vs. selected peers.


We find on average peers have invested $55,000 per employee.


At the moment, WIX is running at approximately $7,000 per employee. 


This begs the question: Why haven’t other businesses figured out and copied WIX’s success and rushed to 


come public to get WIX’s valuation?

Zero (Now: Negative) Customer Churn: 
Too Good To Be True?


WIX has historically claimed zero churn, and now says it has negative churn, an extremely rare situation among SaaS 


companies; in fact, we are hard pressed to find any other public companies making this claim. Be cautioned that WIX 


does not back any of its claims with churn calculations in its SEC filings, so it is very much a “trust us” story. WIX 


tracks churn (as illustrated by the job posting below). Financial reporting practices are supposed to give investors a 


view of the business through the eyes of management. What is management seeing that investors are not?


Q. Sterling Auty: Yes, thanks. Hi, guys. In terms of – one of the comments that 


you made is that you're starting to see also an improvement in retention. Is 


there any additional color you can give in terms of – obviously, we have the 


Slide 9 to give us a visual. But is there any more color you can give us in terms 


of where in the cohorts you're seeing that improved retention? Any feedback 


that you're getting from the customer base as to what's driving that 


improved retention?


A. CEO Abrahami  We believe that the main – well, maybe we start with the 


easiest part, which is – the driver is a better product. If we get a guy between 


us and our competitor, it makes it that even if you want to change your Web site, 


you always go back to Wix. And so, that's what we're seeing. We've disclosed 


the flow of the cohorts. So you can actually deduct the actual changes in terms 


of numbers. But overall, it's always our actual churn is pretty much zero, all 


right? So we don't lose customers. And if you look at the oldest cohort, you 


can actually see that it started with one number and actually it's exactly the 


same number now after six years. And so we continue to see that. And we'll 


update when we have more details.


Q. Tim Klasell: Yes. Sort of jumping back on the new Editor, I know that's 


helping to drive conversion up. But how about on retention? Have you 


noticed any change on retention with users of the new Editor?


A. COO Zohar: Well, yes. So first of all, yes. The new Editor, which is a lot of 


the new functionality there and help a lot more people complete Web sites that 


they're very proud of. And when they do that, of course, they're less likely to 


churn. I just want to address the fact, again, our actual churn, historically, 


is practically zero. We do see some small sign that it actually might go 


above that, meaning we're going to get negative churn. But we'll have to 


wait and see more about that and we'll update you guys as you know.

Clues For How Bad WIX’s Churn Really Is


According to JP Morgan research, a firm that has a “Neutral” rating and a below market price target of 


$67/share, the biggest risk to WIX’s rating is its monthly churn of ~2% and ~4% for users and subscriptions.


Annualizing these figures suggest 24% and 48% churn, respectively. Also, WIX has historically given 


Q1’2010 cohort data in each of its 20-F reports. It says it continues to generate new premium subscriptions, 


and also reports the active premium subscribers from this cohort. Based on our analysis, the percentage of 


active to total new subscribers continues to fall. Buyer beware!

WIX hypes the fact that its cohorts are able to generate residual revenues.


Spruce Point has warned about over-dependence on these types of analyses. To illustrate, BazaarVoice (Nasdaq: BV) 


hyped its cohort analysis at IPO. (1) We recommended a short position in BV, and its share price has subsequently 


declined by 75%. (2) As it relates to WIX, we observe that it recently made a slight restatement of active premium 


subscribers from its initial cohort lower. Buyer beware

Warning: Recent Initial Cohort Was Re-StatedRecent Cohort slide


1) BV IPO prospectus


2) Spruce Point BV report


Recent investor enthusiasm has been around the uptake of new cohorts, but it remains to be seen if they can stick in the face of


less customer service and support personnel, and evidence suggesting increasing complaints. If history is any guide, WIX will


experience a decline in subscriptions from these cohorts over time. We also believe current cohorts are at risk of churn due to 


higher discount incentives offered upfront, which would increase the cost for the subscriber to continue

Collection Issues Signal Slowdown: Why Are 
Revenue And Collections Growth Diverging?


• JPM Analyst Auty Q4’16 Conf Call (2/12/17):  “Looking at the guidance for 2017, can you walk us through why the collections growth and the 
revenue growth are - have diverged to this extent?”


• CFO Shemesh:  “With regard to the revenue, as we know that the revenue takes time until catch up with collection, usually 6 to 12 months 
obviously because of revenue. The second half of 2016 we accelerated the growth in term of collection, so we actually saw a much better growth 
more than 40% during the second half of 2016. So I think that when you look at revenue, it basically represents the growth of collection that 
we've seen in the previous year. So obviously if on 2016 the overall collection growth was 42% so you should explain the revenue to catch up with 
that. And to represent the same growth that we've seen in collection over the previous year. So that basically kind of explained to you why the 
growth in revenue actually accelerated and it's more than the growth of collection that we guided for 2017.”

Investors are cautioned to observe the recent divergence of sales growth vs. collections growth forecasted in 2017. When 


asked, the CFO’s explanation seems murky and difficult to validate. He claims collections accelerated with no explanation 


why. We’ve analyzed the annual growth rates for both variables, and find that they historically track each other within a 


couple percent. We also checked his assertion that collections growth was accelerated in 2H16, yet we don’t find evidence 


that collections growth outpaced sales. Our takeaway: WIX’s business is slowing

Spruce Point finds it hard to believe that: 1) WIX does not provide guidance of registered users or premium 


subscribers (a critical driver of its financial model), 2) WIX’s financial guidance is so narrow and precise to 


be within just a few million dollars, and 3) that WIX’s guidance is becoming less transparent. 


(1) WIX guided to a 30-32% increase over 2015


Our concerns about WIX’s 


capex are heightened by the fact 


that this is the only item that it 


underestimated. Also, the 2017 


capex is identical to the 2016 


despite 40%+ growth forecasts

WIX’s deferred revenue accounts merit scrutiny. The Company reports almost no long-term deferred 


revenue. This is surprising given the nature of its business, and recent new Risk Factor disclosure that it

A decrease in annual subscriptions or renewal rates of our existing premium subscriptions could adversely impact our collections and
revenues, result in delayed or lower than forecasted profitability, and harm our ability to forecast our business.


The rate at which premium subscriptions are purchased and the rate at which premium subscriptions are renewed, significantly impact the
overall number of premium subscriptions and, as a result, our collections and our revenues. As of December 31, 2016, one-year, two-year
and three-year subscription packages constituted approximately 83% of all premium subscriptions. (Source: 2016 p. 7 vs. 2015 p. 8)

Prior 2015 Disclosure on App Market Revenue


Warning: WIX restated its App Market revenues lower recently. It’s hard to trust management’s claims 


that ARPU is rising from more App Market sales, when it cannot accurately calculate App Market sales!


CFO on Q3’15 Earnings Call (11/4/15): “Our average revenue per subscription is also up year-over-year, excluding 


the impact of currency and the mix shift to more annual plans that has taken place over the last year. The increase in 


ARPU is being driven by increased sales of apps in our App Market, vertical apps and other revenue sources 


such as domains and images.”

Tis The Season….Q2 or Q4 Says Management


Either WIX management doesn’t know its business well, or is making up excuses to divert 


investor attention away from underlying weakness. Consider the statements below, when 


discussing the seasonality of the business – is Q2 or Q4 the slowest?  


COO Zohar Q4’15 Earnings Call (2/10/16): “The fourth quarter is historically our slowest quarter, so 


we typically run several seasonal promotions, which we did this year as well.”


CFO Shemesh Q2’15 Earnings Call (8/2/15): “So generally, if you remember, we spoke about this in the 


past. Q2 is customarily in terms of seasonality, a slower or even the slowest quarter of the year, 


which kind of makes sense as to why you'll see a better performance in terms of the contribution of the older 


cohorts into this specific quarter.”


COO Zohar Q2’15 Earnings Call (8/2/15): “Our strong user and subscription growth continues. We are 


particularly happy with our results this quarter as Q2 is seasonally our lowest (sic: slowest) quarter.”


CEO Abrahami Q3’16 Earnings Call (11/10/16):  “So, the fourth quarter usually we know that we have a lot 


of holiday. So, basically the fourth quarter is the weak one among all the other quarters because of 


vacations and holidays.”


Only Mention of Seasonality In WIX’s Results Were Its Prospectus, Recent 20-F’s Don’t Elaborate Further: 


“We believe there are slight seasonal impacts to our business during major holiday periods when we experience lower than 


average daily site traffic. However to date, seasonal impacts have not been clearly visible in our quarterly consolidated results 


of operations, which we believe may be due to the rapid growth of our business and our geographic breadth. In the future, 


seasonal trends may cause fluctuations in our quarterly results, including fluctuations in sequential collections.   (Source: F-1

SEC Weighs In on WIX’s Aggressive 
EBITDA Presentation And More…


WIX’s Adjusted EBITDA has come under scrutiny from the SEC from a comment letter in Feb 2016 related to 


changes in deferred revenues. (1) The Company is now abandoning its EBITDA presentation practices 


according to a statement on its last earnings conference call a year later in Feb 2017. (2)


However, notice that the SEC also called out accelerated revenue recognition while delaying expenses. 


When will WIX provide greater clarity and/or make changes?


SEC Comment: “In addition, your disclosures do not comply with Item 10(e)(i)(C) of Regulation S-K because you do not explain
to investors how they should compensate for the mixed attributes of your measure. For example, revenues are accelerated to
when billed, but other line items such as expenses are not.”

WIX New Warning Buried In 20-F….


If you don’t consider any of our concerns, at least pay close attention to WIX’s recently filed 20-F, which sets the 


stage for a potential revenue restatement. WIX also references a “significant financing component” in revenues. 


Never having disclosed customer financing, what exactly is it referring to ?


Revenue from Contracts with Customers


In May 2014, the FASB issued ASU 2014-09 guidance on revenue from contracts with customers that will supersede the existing revenue recognition guidance and 


clarify the principles for recognizing revenue. The core principle is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to 


customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods and services.


1. The guidance determines a five-step model for recognizing revenue from contracts with customers:


2. Identifying the contract


3. Identifying performance obligations


4. Determining the transaction price


5. Allocating the transaction price to separate performance obligations


6. Recognizing revenue


Other major provisions include, among others, consideration of the time value of money in the transaction price and requiring estimates of variable consideration. 


The guidance also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from an entity’s contracts 


with customers. The effective date was deferred for one year to the interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2017. The Company has 


established an implementation team and has started analyzing the impact of the guidance. The Company is in the process of reviewing its current 


accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the guidance to its revenue 


contracts.


With the assessment in its progress, the Company identified the following areas that may be affected:


i. Estimations of the transaction price due to variable consideration and significant financing component.


ii. Assessment of when control of certain promised performance obligations, aside from the Company's premium subscriptions, are transferred to the 


customer.


In addition, the Company is in the process of identifying appropriate changes to its business processes, systems and controls to support recognition 


and disclosure under the new guidance.  The guidance permits the use of either a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method. We have not yet selected 


a transition method. We expect to select transition method once we finalized our analysis to the standard. The FASB has issued, and may issue in the future, 


interpretive guidance which may cause our evaluation to change. We believe we are following an appropriate timeline to allow for proper recognition, presentation 


and disclosure upon adoption effective the beginning of fiscal year 2018.

customer financing. What is 


it referring to?

Read The Fine Print: Warning of Potential 
Material Weaknesses of Financial Controls


It always pays to read the fine print. WIX is clearly warning investors to not be surprised if a material 


weakness of financial controls emerges…. 


Source: WIX 2016 20-F, pp.31-32


If we are unable to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), or if our internal control


over financial reporting is not effective, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and the completeness of our financial reports, the


reliability of our financial statements may be questioned and our share price may suffer.


The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and


procedures. Pursuant to Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, we are


required to furnish a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, during the fiscal year ended


December 31, 2016, our management commenced the process of evaluating the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally,


pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, beginning with our annual report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, as we are no


longer an emerging growth company and qualify as a large accelerated filer, we must include an auditor attestation on our internal control over


financial reporting.


To maintain the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, we expect that we will need to


continue enhancing existing, and implement new, financial reporting and management systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively


and support our growth in the future. The process of evaluating our internal control over financial reporting will continue to require an investment of


substantial time and resources, including by our Chief Financial Officer and other members of our senior management. The determination and any remedial


actions required could divert internal resources and take a significant amount of time and effort to complete and could result in us incurring additional costs


that we did not anticipate, including the hiring of outside consultants. Additionally, as part of management assessments of the effectiveness of our


internal control over financial reporting, our management may conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is not effective due to


our failure to cure any identified material weakness or otherwise, which would require us to employ remedial actions to implement effective


controls. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, if we are unable to comply with the requirements of


Section 404 in a timely manner or to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public


accounting firm is unable to express an opinion or issues an adverse opinion in its attestation as to the effectiveness of our internal control over


financial reporting required by Section 404(b), investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the


trading price of our ordinary shares could be negatively affected. We could also become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on


which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.


Irrespective of compliance with Section 404, any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and


harm our reputation. As a result, we may experience higher than anticipated operating expenses, as well as higher independent auditor fees during and after


the implementation of these changes. If we are unable to implement any of the required changes to our internal control over financial reporting effectively or


efficiently, it could adversely affect our operations, financial reporting and/or results of operations and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls


from our independent auditors. Further, if our internal control over financial reporting is not effective, the reliability of our financial statements may be


questioned and our share price may suffer.

Management, Governance and  
Audit Integrity

WIX’s CFO Has Been Associated With Not 1, 
Not 2, But 3 Controversial Companies


Person (Role) Work Experience Notes


Lior Shemesh
(CFO)


• Prior to joining Wix in March 2013, worked at 
Alvarion Ltd (VP of Finance/CFO) 2008-2013


• Prior to Alvarion, he was VP of Finance at Veraz 
Networks 2003-2008 (merged with Dialogic
which was delisted from Nasdaq to the bulletin 
board and sold for pennies)


• Prior to Alvarion, Financial Controller of ECI 
Telecom


• Alvarion was public on Nasdaq and went into 
receivership and liquidation and eventually 
delisted


• Allegations of fraud from the former financial 
controller at Alvarion prior to Shemesh joining


• Veraz Networks charged by the SEC with FCPA 
violations in 2007-2008 period


• ECI Telecom faced a serious shareholder lawsuit
claiming it hyped its technology and engaged in a 
reckless scheme with improper sales and revenue 
recognition policies in violation of GAAP.  ECI 
reached a settlement without admitting guilt


Yaniv Even-Haim
(VP of R&D)


• From September 2001 for eight years Yaniv 
headed Comverse’s R&D Organization of 
Content Business 


• SEC charges former Comverse CEO, CFO and GC in 
stock option backdating scheme and material 
misstatement of results from between 1991 and 
at least 2002


Pay careful attention to WIX’s CFO.


He held stints at Alvarion and Veraz Networks, which were both controversial companies that had their 


stock prices bleed to zero and had allegations of fraud and SEC inquiries. He also was a financial controller 


at ECI Telecom, which faced serious allegations of fraud.

Early WIX Backers And Insiders Are 
Unloading Shares…


Key venture partners (Bessemer, Benchmark and Insight) have completely exited. Insider ownership is now 


down from 39.4% to 19.6% (-20%). Do they know something we don’t?


WIX is increasingly owned by US investors, and no major Israeli institutions

Analysts have a resounding “Buy” or “Overweight” recommendation on WIX and have an average price 


target of $71.60 per share leaving little upside from the current price. WIX’s shares are already up almost 


60% YTD, and were trading above the average analyst price target. This doesn’t appear to be a good entry 


point for owning WIX. Even Cantor Fitzgerald downgraded recently from Buy to Neutral (ironically also 


upping the price target from $65 to $80…hmm) (1)

Promoter View Vs. Reality


What The Stock Promoters Say Spruce Point’s View


Needham (Buy $73: March 2017):


• “We are encouraged by Wix's acquisition of DeviantArt (DA). 


We believe the acquisition provides Wix with exclusive access 


to DA's 40M registered users and 45M monthly unique visitors. 


With Wix's improving conversion rates, we believe these users 


could boost its premium subscribers, collections, and revenue.”


JPM Morgan (Neutral: $70, March 2017)


• “No one was questioning whether things are good for Wix or not 


because it is clear things are going really well.”


• “While WordPress, the largest website building platform prior to 


Wix, tapped out at about 100M users, if we look at popular 


social media platforms such as Facebook we see user accounts 


approaching 1B or more. So perhaps the registered user 


population addressable market is somewhere in between the 


100M WordPress users and a billion users for the most popular 


social media platform”


Stephens (Buy: $50, Aug 2016)


• “WIX's business model is "SaaS"-ier than ever. In our opinion, 


WIX has more of a SaaS business model and should be lumped 


in that peer group rather than its historical peer group. More 


than 80% of WIX's subscriptions are annual, which provides the 


same visibility and predictability of many SaaS companies”


• We estimate DeviantArt does $9.6m of revenues. 


Paying ~$55/yr per member, that equates to 174k of 


paying subscribers, which is just 0.4% of its registered 


users. Compare this with WIX’s penetration ratio of 


2.5% and it’s easy to see that DeviantArt’s customers 


are tougher to convert to paying


• WIX’s SaaS business is an outlier that deserves scrutiny. 


Its gross margins are much higher than peers, its capex 


significantly lower, and its absence of long-term deferred 


revenue in the face of more annual subscriptions should 


be considered a red flag. In total, WIX is a low quality 


SasS business with many short-term customers, high 


churn, and low customer switching costs


• Perhaps things should be questioned given the abrupt 


change in financial performance, extreme appreciation 


in share price, and our forensic research which indicates 


financial and accounting deviations and restatements


• We think it is becoming clear that WIX is also 


experiencing growth challenges at the 100M user level, 


and its strategy shift to acquire DeviantArt is a strong 


symptom of the problem


• Comparing WIX with a social media platform such as 


Facebook is a nice stretch by an analyst to justify 


continued buying of shares

WIX Trading At An Unjustified 
Premium To Its Peers 


WIX’s overvaluation is easy to observe from its current relative valuation to peers. The Bulls would explain the 


valuation by saying that WIX’s revenue and EPS growth rate vastly exceed its peers. Our rebuttal is that WIX is a 


lower quality SaaS company with high customer churn and many short duration customers. The most shocking 


valuation data point is that WIX trades at $1,600 per subscriber. The average revenue per subscriber (ARPU) is 


$137/year; this implies investors are paying >12yrs of revenues at current valuation. The peers trade at closer to $500 


per subscriber with higher ARPUs. The Street also fails to: 1) capture WIX’s true diluted share count, and 


2) use the new EBITDA (ex: change in deferred revenues)

WIX’s Valuation From A 
Historical Trading Perspective…


EV / Free Cash Flow


EV / Revenues


Enterprise Value / Paying Subscriber


WIX’s valuation is trading at peak levels despite 
worrying signs of:


1. Rising customer acquisition costs
2. Declining customer growth rates
3. Acquisition integration risks
4. Financial presentation discrepancies
5. Risk of material weaknesses in accounting
6. Shareholder rotation by early investors
7. Overhang of large potential share issuance

Current valuation of $1,600+
per paying sub that has an 


ARPU below industry, significant 
churn and little long-term 


deferred revenue makes little 
sense. Valuing WIX in line with 


peers is more appropriate


Spruce Point Reference Prices Ranges


By all measures, WIX’s share price is overvalued. Given the numerous signs of emerging accounting 


distortions, slowing collections growth, shift in strategy to acquisitions, and subtle warnings of dilution, it 


seems prudent for investors to take a step back to evaluate WIX’s valuation. We think WIX’s price could 


decline by 20% just on the revision on the share count, and 50% - 60% overall
