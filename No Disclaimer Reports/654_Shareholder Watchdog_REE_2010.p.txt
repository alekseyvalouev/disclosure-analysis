Rare Element Resources: Potential Short Opportunity

We have witnessed a fair share of bubbles over the past 15 years: internet stocks,
housing, crude oil, and Chinese stocks. We have had some success in identifying
"bubbles" in individual stocks and warning the investment community about specific issues
(including HUSA at $20.35 see here and PCBC at $5.11 see here). Possibly the most
voracious bubble in recent memory is occurring with Rare Earth Element ("RE" or "RE
elements") stocks. We have done some work framing the opportunities and risks within
the RE elements space. After sifting through the hype, we believe there is tremendous risk
in RE stocks and highlight Rare Element Resources (AMEX: "REE" $12.74/ TSX: "REC")
as a potential short opportunity, or at least a stock investors should avoid.


Rare Element is a Canadian based company that owns the Bear Lodge mine located in
the northeastern corner of Wyoming. The stock price is up over 500% since early July and
over 65% in the past three days. With the euphoria of the strong move in RE element
stocks, speculators have bought first and asked questions later. We believe Rare Element
investors will wish they had done more diligence before piling into a company with a
potentially worthless plot of land. We believe Rare Element is a heavily promoted stock
with questionable management and massive risks to a business plan that under the
rosiest scenario will not be at full production until 2015 or 2016. By that time, we expect
the world could suffer from a glut of RE supplies. As a result, we believe current investors
face at least 70% downside from current levels.


Rare Earths - Not That Rare


"Rare earth elements" are 17 minerals on the periodic table. The elements are used in
various applications, typically in miniscule quantities. There is a reason many investors
had not heard of the RE elements since middle school science class. Simply, rare earth

elements represent a very small market. According to the USGS, a mere 124,000 tons of
RE were consumed worldwide representing a market size of LESS THAN $2 BILLION
(source: Reuters and USGS).


Over a year ago, stories began to appear about China's dominance in RE mining with
97% of the world's production and exploration efforts in South Africa, Brazil, Canada and
the United States (see this story dated September 2009 here). As with most hyped
spaces, this story has been recycled on a daily basis by news agencies, internet chat
rooms, and even company IR firms. Following the IPO of MolyCorp (NYSE: MCP) in July
and recent Chinese export quotas, RE element prices and stocks have skyrocketed.
China is now using its market clout in RE as a political statement, increasing export
quotas and withholding exports to Japan. The result has been a further spike in RE
element prices.


We believe elevated RE prices are a temporary phenomenon for two reasons. First, we
believe China will likely concede and begin exporting RE elements again as political
pressures mount. The Chinese have a history of flooding markets with a massive supply
of raw materials or end products, and could resume exporting and crush RE prices at any
time.


Second, the term "rare earth" is a misnomer. According to the USGS: "despite their name,
most rare earths are not particularly rare." The USGS estimates that the total worldwide
reserves of RE are 99 million tons, or 800 years of supply at current consumption rates.

China 36,000,000


United States 13,000,000


Soviet Union 19,000,000


Total Worldwide 99,000,000

In addition, most rare earth consumption takes place in China, which consumed 65% of
supply according to the USGS. Most of the goods produced in China with RE element
inputs actually end up as exports to the rest of the world (and these products are not

subject to any quotas). Japan consumes another 26% of supply, meaning these two
countries consume over 90% of worldwide supply. According to the USGS, the U.S.
imported less than 7,000 tons of RE in 2009 and actually exported a greater quantity than
it imported. (see here .pdf).


When MolyCorp's Mountain Pass mine is running in 2012, management has stated that
they expect to produce 20,000 tons of RE. This represents THREE TIMES the amount of
RE imported to the U.S. in 2009. The U.S. Geological Survey estimates that China's
Bayan Obo mine has more than 40 million tons of RE elements (see here), which is
enough to supply the world for over 300 years alone. Congress and the U.S. military have
also expressed concern for RE element needs for certain weapons. We estimate that the
demand by the U.S. military is likely less than 1,000 tons a year, and will easily be
addressed by Mountain Pass.

We expect the world to be awash in RE supply when/if Rare Element's Bear Lodge is
producing in 2015 or 2016. Currently, the worldwide demand for RE outside of China is a
meager 44,000 tons, and only 12,000 tons excluding Japan. While we view RE elements
as a growth market, we believe RE recycling and RE alternatives could mute market
growth. We reviewed plans for six public companies in the RE space, and combined,
they plan over 82,000 tons of production of RE per year [Lynas (OTCPK:LYSCF) (22k),
Arafura (20k), MCP (20k), Avalon (AVARF.PK) (5k), Quest Rare (5k), Rare Element
(10K)]. This represents almost two times the current demand outside of China and
excludes massive private projects in India, Brazil, South Africa, Australia and the US. One
estimate suggests that over a year ago there were 120 RE element mining projects
globally at various stages (see here). And this was BEFORE the recent spike in prices.
Given the massive expansion of worldwide RE mining, we expect the world to experience
a glut of RE elements by the time Rare Element's mine is up and running. As a result, we
believe it is a faulty assumption to extrapolate "bubble" pricing into future projections.


Red Flags at Bear Lodge


Turning our attention to the tiny Canadian speculative outfit, we could not help but find the
ticker amusing: REE. Sadly, we had immediate memories of the pain Internet.com created
near the top of the dot.com bubble. Rare Element currently has a market cap of over $400
million. Their latest financials show about $10 million of assets and zero revenues. They
had $5 million of cash on balance sheet at their last filing. According to their last 20-F,
Rare Element has two full-time employees and five part-time employees (see here).
This "exploration and development" company has spent less than $7,000.00 over the past
three years (see here). The management team has put out a steady stream of press
releases, but we have little doubt that these promotional releases will ultimately be
irrelevant for Rare Element until we are much closer to the middle of the decade.


The name of the property where Rare Element is conducting its RE element testing is
Bear Lodge, located in the northeast corner of Wyoming. Spartacus Capital, the
predecessor company to Rare Elements, acquired the Bear Lodge mine in 2002 for less
than $1 million. The company expects production of the plant to begin in 2015. According
the Rare Elements own documents, over the past 38 years, three highly sophisticated
mining companies, MolyCorp, Hecla Mining (NYSE:HL), and Duval Corporation, owned
and explored Bear Lodge for RE elements. After 44 drill holes, none these sophisticated
miners continued to drill, all choosing to abandon their efforts and eat the sunk costs. We
believe one of the reasons is the low ore grade of Bear Lodge. According to Rare
Element's investor presentation, Bear Lodge has an ore grade of 3.5%, less that half of

MolyCorp's Mountain Pass (8.2%) and a third of Lynas' Mount Weld (13.6%). Based on
our research (we ask readers to conduct their own research on this topic), this makes
Bear Lodge's prospects for successful operation extremely dependent on RE element
prices staying at existing levels. If our earlier assumption is correct (along with the
apparent conclusion of three highly sophisticated miners), and prices of RE elements
normalize, it will be uneconomical to mine Bear Lodge (assuming the asset even
possesses enough to participate in the future of this over supplied market). So while many
RE stocks have increased significantly on higher RE prices, most, including Rare
Elements, will never be in a position to take advantage of today's prices.


Given the abundance of RE elements worldwide, access to RE may not be that
problematic, but processing RE elements into usable raw materials is expensive, difficult
and environmentally destructive. In fact, Mountain Pass was originally shut down not only
due to a flood of cheap RE elements from China, but also for environmental concerns. To
justify Rare Element's lofty current market cap, we believe prices of RE not only need to
stay extremely high, but Rare Element must build processing capability. A Bryon
Securities report estimates this would cost Rare Elements $350 million. In addition, Rare
Elements would have to overcome significant permitting and environmental concerns,
along with significant start-up expenses. With two full employees, a tiny balance sheet,
and prospects for significant dilutive equity deals, common sense suggests something
does not pass the smell test.


We put little value on Rare Element's other projects: gold mining at Bear Lodge and Eden
Lake. Eden Lake is a property Rare Element acquired recently for less than $1 million.
Rare Element management also claims potential for gold mining. Earlier this year,
Newmont (NYSE: NEM) walked away from a JV they had with Rare Elements on this
property for a sum total of $27,000 worth of paid expenses (6/8/2010 filing outlines the
termination of their JV). Newmont will receive a net smelter royalty should anything be
found, but cut their losses on development and exploration (they spent almost $3 million in
development and refused to spend more). So Bear Lodge was basically given to them for
free by Freeport in exchange for a net smelter royalty, which they repurchased for a total
of $50,000 from Freeport and Newmont. Given the sophistication of Newmont, we believe
gold project offers little value.


Red Flags Around Management


The quality of a management team is extremely important for any small cap company. But
when your management bench is as small as Rare Element's, assessment of
management is vital. We found it curious that Rare Elements shares its address in their

5/22/2018 Rare Element Resources: Potential Short Opportunity | Seeking Alpha

filings (325 Howe St., #410, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6C 1Z7) with at least
six other businesses (Pacific Opportunity Capital run by Chairman and CEO Donald
Ranta, CFO Mark T. Brown and Secretary Winnie Wong; Animas Resources [ANI.V];
Tenant Payment Systems; Avrupa Minerals LTD. [AVU.V] formerly Everclear Capital;
Cordova Industries; and Sutter Gold Mining Inc. [SGM.V].


Our concern was already elevated given the commingled nature of the office address, but
nothing could have prepared us for the shock of seeing management's bios and history.
Most management teams we talk to are consumed with running one company. We believe
it is a significant red flag that critical members of Rare Element's management team are
engaged with more than five companies currently. It is our understanding that Rare
Element's secretary Winnie Wong and CFO Mark T. Brown are principals of something
called Pacific Opportunity Capital LTD that shares office space with Rare Elements. Mark
T. Brown's bio in the 20-F lists 18 companies where he is the current or former CFO or
director. Almost all of these companies are Canadian-traded penny stocks. A simple
google news search reveals that Mark T. Brown has issued press releases for at least
three other companies in the past two weeks, including Pitchstone Exploration, Avrupa
Minerals and Tarsis.


Chairman and CEO Donald E. Ranta was previously with Greenstone Resources, a
mining play that is currently trading in the penny territory. Mr. Ranta is also on the board of
Avrupa Minerals, along with the CFO Mark T Brown and secretary Winnie Wong.
Secretary Winnie Wong was (until recently) also the secretary of Portal Resources
[PDO.V], an oil and gas penny stock. She is also the CFO for something called Avrupa
Minerals, currently trading in the 41 cent range in Canada. Then there’s Apoquindo
Minerals, of which she is also the corporate secretary, and there is Animas Resources
LTD [ANI.V] of which she is CFO (another 43 cent stock). She’s also been associated with
Fox Resources as their CFO, Deal Capital as President, and Mediterranean Minerals as
CFO.


Conclusion


One recent rational voice in RE elements is the CEO of Neo Materials [TSX: NEM],
Constantine Karayannopoulos. As a company with 85% market share in processing neo
powders, Karayannopoulos is heavily incentivized to promote RE elements. However, in
several recent presentations, he has expressed concerns around the bubble in RE
elements. By way of background, Neo Materials has exclusive access to mine heavy rare
