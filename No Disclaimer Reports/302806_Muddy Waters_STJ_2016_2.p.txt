Convincing Statements are used by deceptive persons in an attempt to manage the perception of 
their accuser towards the positive. The underlying goal of this linguistic device is to convince the 
other party that the accused would never do the thing they are accused of because they are not 
that kind of person, or in this case, that kind of company. When one cannot clearly show through 
the presentation of facts that they did not do the bad thing, then they must resort to another 
approach. Focusing on the kind of person/company they are is a subtle diversion away from the 
actual actions they took or failed to take – the bad thing they are being accused of. When used by 
corporations, as opposed to individuals defending themselves, Convincing Statements often take 
the form of sales language, canned corporate speak, and highly generalized statements that 
contain very little real information. STJ’s response contains a litany of these Convincing 
Statements: 
 


“Our top priority is to reassure our patients….” 
“St. Jude Medical stands behind the security and safety….” 
“St. Jude Medical will remain ever vigilant and dedicated….” 
“…..are not aware of such threats and will remain vigilant to the…..” 
“We recognize the importance of providing physicians with up-to-date and accurate 
information in a timely and responsible manner…” 
“Patient safety has always been our top priority and we have every reason to believe….” 


 
Don’t be fooled by the fact that this kind of language is used often – deception is a very common 
part of human communication. It is the dense cluster of these statements in a relatively short 
rebuttal that indicates deception.  
 
Exclusionary Qualifiers are used by deceptive persons when they wish to deny a specific portion 
of an accusation, while leaving the door slightly open to other portions. The below is a perfect 
example:

“Our analysis concluded that the majority of the observations in the report apply to older 
versions of the Merlin@home devices (i.e., those that have not been updated through the 
automated remote upgrade process).”  


 
By inserting the word “majority” they are indicating that some of the observations made by 
MWC apply to more current versions of the Merlin@home devices. If this is true, then they are 
acknowledging some legitimacy to MWC’s claims. If their primary goal is to ensure the 
complete security of all of their devices then they would use this opportunity to provide clear 
guidance to all customers on how to fully secure them. Instead, they offer an additional 
Convincing Statement coupled with a Perception Qualifier: 
 


“We are confident in the technology that we provide and in our process for continuously 
building upon our security protocols and processes.” 


 
This statement is a veiled admission to lesser security quality in previous devices – many of 
which are currently being used by patients – and the need to continue improving their existing 
security protocols and processes. The insertion of the phrase “We are confident…” is a 
commonly used Perception Qualifier. Its goal is to add credibility to their assertion without 
providing fact, as the facts are likely not their ally. Their statement offers no technical, 
measurable, or quantifiable reason for their confidence…we are just supposed to feel better 
because they are confident.  
 
Borrowed Credibility. When companies repeatedly refer to regulatory bodies, legal processes, 
and industry standards, one should be cautious. It is not hard to produce a long list of companies 
that satisfied all of these requirements while simultaneously committing fraud or gross 
negligence. Reference to these agencies and processes, therefore, is an attempt to borrow the 
credibility of those organizations when their credibility is taking a hit.  
 
These references are a critical piece of their Diversion Narrative – a story designed to “look 
away” from the specific issue to a better story about past compliance with regulatory processes. 
When your child brings home a report card with four A’s and one D, be prepared for him or her 
to divert the narrative away from the D to the four A’s. He or she may even be tempted to 
remind you of past report cards that did not contain any D’s.  
 
The real concern. It is my opinion that STJ tipped their hand in the following statement: 
 


“We recognize the importance of providing physicians with up-to-date and accurate 
information in a timely and responsible manner so that they can make informed patient 
care decisions. Our analysis reinforces the need for researchers and manufactures to 
work together to discuss and resolve potential issues together to avoid unnecessarily 
alarming patients.”  


 
Their analysis? Are they referring to their analysis of the MWC report? If so, are they consenting 
to the notion that MWC’s findings represent “potential issues” that require collaboration between 
“researchers and manufacturers”? Would it not be more correct to say “MWC’s analysis has 
brought to light multiple issues that underscore the need for researchers and manufacturers to

work together to discuss and resolve”? I’d say it does - and constitutes a veiled admission that 
significant security issues exist. It further points to their frustration with MWC’s public display 
of their findings, as does the following statement in their opening paragraph: “… while we would 
have preferred the opportunity to review a detailed account of the information…” The extremely 
rapid rebuttal produced by STJ, its lack of substance, and the clusters of deceptive behaviors it 
contains, suggests their core agenda is to inject optimism back into the market, not necessarily 
the “responsible working together to discuss and resolve potential issues…” tack they purport.  
 
Conclusion 
Given the density of the clusters of deceptive indicators in this rebuttal it is highly likely that STJ 
is being deceptive about the cyber security of its cardiac devices and their knowledge of their 
existing limitations. Their agenda is to manage the perception of the market in the short term 
from pessimism to optimism, erode the credibility of the MWC report and present confidence in 
the face of specific allegations while simultaneously failing (or choosing not) to insert inarguable 
facts to the contrary.
