MPAA


MPAA and its executives have a history of being involved with accounting fraud
over the last 20 years.


MPAA's current accounting appear to materially overstate earnings. In my opinion,
true economic earnings appear close to zero.


MPAA almost went bankrupt twice before in the wake of prior accounting scandals,
and given current balance sheet and leverage, MPAA remains a strong candidate
for bankruptcy in the future.


Insiders have benefited from this aggressive accounting and liquidated huge
quantities of stock at inflated prices over the last several years.

Motorcar Parts of America (NASDAQ:MPAA) is an automotive aftermarket parts
company. It manufactures, remanufactures, and distributes alternators and starters
("rotating electrical," 78.9% of FY 2019 revenue) and wheel hubs (15.7% of FY19
revenue). Its other products include master brake cylinders and diagnostic/testing
equipment.


MPAA has the most complex inventory accounting of any company I've ever seen, and I
believe that the company's reported earnings and especially adjusted earnings do not
accurately represent the economics of the business. In fact, earnings and cash flow
have diverged dramatically in recent years, forcing the company to rely on increased
borrowing from its revolver and factoring receivables. I believe the situation has
deteriorated to the point that it raises solvency concerns.


My concerns about the MPAA's accounting are amplified by its colorful history. MPAA
has had inventory accounting scandals twice over the last twenty years. The first
was in the late 1990s and was orchestrated by then Chief Operating Officer Richard
Marks, son of the company's founder, and Peter Bromberg, MPAA's Chief Financial
Officer at the time. Both men were convicted on criminal charges and sentenced to jail
time after the accounting fraud at MPAA came to light, and the company's earnings
needed to be materially restated. These executives are no longer with MPAA.


The second instance of accounting malfeasance was related to Fenwick Automotive
Products Limited ("Fenco"), a company acquired in 2011 while MPAA was run by current
CEO Selwyn Joffe. After the acquisition, MPAA learned that Fenco's inventory
accounting was fraudulent. Instead of coming clean about the problem, several lawsuits
allege that Joffe misled creditors and suppliers about the financial condition of Fenco
and MPAA's willingness to pay Fenco's bills before the subsidiary filed for Chapter 7
Bankruptcy in June 2013.

Business


I believe MPAA's accounting has once again become overly aggressive and does not
accurately reflect economic reality. MPAA longs likely believe they own a "low P/E"
stock, but the earnings in recent years are the product of ballooning "contract asset"
balances and are not supported by cash flow. The company has plugged the cash flow
hole by drawing its revolver to the point where solvency should now be a serious
concern. In my opinion, a material restatement and covenant violations are the likely
outcome. I sent several questions about MPAA's accounting to investor relations at the
company but thus far have not received a reply.


Skeptical bulls on MPAA will likely doubt the bear case laid out here, but insiders appear
to have their own concerns, as evidenced by the rampant insider selling in recent years.
If I am correct that the inventory accounting used at MPAA has materially overstated
earnings, then the insider selling represents a wealth transfer from investors to insiders
at inflated and unjustified prices.


I will review the evidence for my conclusions in several sections below. Because of the
length and complexity of the material, I have summarized each section in bold after
each section heading.


MPAA's business consists of taking broken down parts and reusing components of
them. It sources the broken-down parts, called "cores," from its customers, which is
accounted for as contracts with customers. MPAA's top 3 customers constitute 83% of
its net revenue.


Re-manufacturing is a process whereby MPAA acquires used and no longer functioning
parts from customers, called "cores," salvages the reusable components and replaces
the rest. The end product is a relatively cheap replacement for an alternator, starter
motor, or a wheel hub, which is installed on a car or truck directly by the consumer or
their mechanic. 83% of MPAA's FY 2019 net sales were to 3 customers, as shown in the
table below from the FY 2019 10-K:

The top auto retailers in the United States are Autozone (AZO), Advance Auto Parts
(AAP), O'Reilly Automotive (ORLY), NAPA (owned by Genuine Parts Company (GPC)),
and/or Pep Boys (privately owned). All 5 of these companies are specifically mentioned
in an S-1 filing from 2012, and I think it's safe to assume MPAA's top 3 customers are
among this group. Motorcar Parts of America sources most of its cores through those
same retail channels. The retail chains receive the cores directly from their consumers,
who get a rebate when they return the core to the store. The re-manufactured product
itself is sometimes sold as a private label and sometimes sold under the MPAA brand.


One very important feature of MPAA's business model is the "Core Exchange Program,"
described as follows in the 2019 10-K:


We obtain most Used Cores by providing credits to our customers for Used Cores
returned to us under our core exchange program. Our customers receive these Used
Cores from consumers who deliver a Used Core to obtain credit from our customers
upon the purchase of a newly remanufactured automobile part. When sufficient Used
Cores are not available from our customers, we purchase Used Cores from core
brokers, who are in the business of buying and selling Used Cores. The Used Cores
purchased from core brokers or returned to us by our customers under the core
exchange program, and which have been physically received by us, are part of our
raw material and work-in-process inventory. Used Cores returned by consumers to
our customers but not yet returned to us are classified as contract assets until we
physically receive these Used Cores.

A brief history of MPAA: accounting fraud, related party
transactions, correspondence with the SEC, massive insider
selling, and two near bankruptcies


Episode I (1994-2003): IPO, related party transactions, fraud,
a near bankruptcy, and insider enrichment


According to company filings and other materials, the core exchange program has
existed in some form since at least the 1990s. The program has very important
implications for MPAA's accounting because it means that its customers are also its
suppliers, and thus a significant part of its inventory is accounted for as contracts with its
customers (now governed by ASC 606) rather than traditional inventory accounting.


MPAA has gone through two accounting scandals in its history, and both episodes were
remarkably similar. First, there was improper accounting or outright fraud related to core
exchange liabilities and the valuation of cores in inventory. Insiders sold stock before the
accounting problems were revealed to the public. Once the truth came out, MPAA's
stock crashed and it fell out of compliance with its debt covenants but managed to
survive by obtaining waivers. Rather than facing accountability, insiders either kept their
jobs or benefited from related party transactions.


Motorcar Parts of America was started by Mel Marks in 1968 as a parts importer. After
an acquisition in 1985, it changed its focus to re-manufacturing of replacement starters
and alternators. Mel's son, Richard Marks, became a director and Chief Operating
Officer (COO) in 1987. Mel and Richard Marks took the company public in 1994.


The father-son team wasn't shy about related party transactions. A note in the 1996
annual report disclosed that MPAA was doing business with MVR Products Limited
("MVR") and Unijoh Sdn, Bhd, which had facilities in Singapore and Malaysia,
respectively. Both companies were 70% owned by Mel and Richard Marks. The 10-Q
filing for September 1997 revealed that "The Company incurred costs of approximately
$906,000 and $536,000 from the affiliates for the six and three months ended
September 30, 1996." The subsequent 10-K disclosed that April of 1997, MPAA bought
both companies in an all-stock transaction.

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/0000910680-96-000171.txt
According to the SEC, the younger Marks and CFO Peter Bromberg began committing
accounting fraud in 1997. In December 2003, Richard Marks pled guilty to criminal
charges that he "engaged in fraudulent accounting practices and falsified Motorcar's
books and records" from 1997 to 1998. The SEC Litigation Release is worth quoting at
length:


The SEC's civil complaint alleges that Marks directed two fraudulent schemes at
the end of fiscal years 1997 and 1998 relating to returned alternators and
starters and customer credits. First, Marks hid product returns from Motorcar's
independent auditor by shipping the returns to offsite storage. After completion of the
audit, Marks allowed the returns to be checked into inventory. Second, Marks caused
Motorcar to understate its reserve for returns and to delay issuing credits to
customers by directing his staff to prepare false schedules for the auditor that
supported an understated reserve for credits that the company had not yet
processed. The SEC's complaint further alleges that Marks lied to Motorcar's
independent auditors when he caused transferred inventory to be double counted.


The SEC's complaint alleges that his actions resulted in the company
overstating its pre-tax earnings for fiscal year 1997 by $3,391,000, or 59.8%,
and for fiscal year 1998 by $3,576,000, or 49.6% … and that Motorcar included
its false 1997 financial statements in a registration statement filed with the SEC in
October 1997 for an offering that raised $19.8 million.


In the related criminal case, Marks agreed to plead guilty to a two-count
information charging him with making false statements in two Form 10-K reports
that were filed with the SEC. In a plea agreement filed this morning, Marks admitted
that he directed Motorcar employees to engage in fraudulent accounting practices
and to falsify Motorcar's books and records, thereby causing false and misleading
statements to be made to the investing public about Motorcar's income. The two
charges against Marks each carry a maximum possible penalty of 10 years in federal
prison and a $1 million fine.

https://www.sec.gov/litigation/litreleases/lr18511.htm
On September 18, 2002, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Central District of
California filed criminal charges against Peter Bromberg, Motorcar's former
CFO, relating to his role in directing Motorcar employees to engage in fraudulent
accounting practices and in causing false and misleading statements to be made to
the investing public about Motorcar's revenues and income. Bromberg has pled
guilty to these criminal charges and is awaiting sentencing.


Both the COO and CFO pled guilty to criminal charges, though per the 2013 10-K,
MPAA paid approximately $603,000 for the legal defense of Richard Marks. Somehow
Chairman and CEO Mel Marks escaped punishment. After the disclosure of the fraud,
the company and its management were defendants in a class-action lawsuit. The
complaint notes that Richard Marks sold 150,000 shares of stock for nearly $2.5 million
and Mel Marks sold 100,000 shares of stock for over $1.6 million in a November 1997
stock offering, implying a price of $16 per share. After the full extent of the accounting
fraud was revealed, shares of MPAA traded for less than $1.

Episode II (2011 - 2014): Fenco, the acquisition that went very
wrong.


The class-action suit was settled for $7.5 million, $6 million of which was paid by the
officers and directors and their insurance carrier. According to the Q1 2001 quarterly
filing, Mel Marks entered into a $1.5 million stock purchase agreement at a price of $1
per share to finance the remainder of the settlement. Because of the falsified inventory
accounting, MPAA had to restate two years and 3 quarters of financial statements and
very nearly went bankrupt - a press release from October of 2000 noted that the
company was in default on its covenants, but it was able to obtain a waiver.


The scandal resulted in management turnover. Mel Marks stepped down as CEO, but
he didn't exactly suffer. He retained his seat on the board and secured a consulting
agreement with the company for $180,000 per year. According to 10-K filings, he was
paid as a consultant every year between 2000 and 2013, and his "consulting"
compensation rose to $350,000 at the end this period. To terminate the consulting
agreement, MPAA paid Mel Marks $650,000 in fiscal year 2013. He was 87 at the time.


MPAA's current CEO, Selwyn Joffe, joined the board of directors in 1994. In December
1999, just after the inventory accounting fraud came to light, he was promoted to
Chairman. In addition to becoming chairmen, Joffe secured a consulting agreement with
the company in 1999 which entitled him to an additional $160,000 per year and 40,000
stock options.


As part of the same management shuffle, Anthony Souza replaced Mel Marks as CEO.
Three years later, in February of 2003, Joffe replaced Souza as CEO but retained the
title of chairman.


Under Joffe's leadership in 2011, MPAA sought to expand its business and product lines
through an acquisition. The FY 2011 10-K describes the transaction as follows:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036111032524/form10k.htm
During fiscal 2011, we made secured loans in the approximate aggregate amount of
$4,863,000 to Fenwick Automotive Products Limited ("Fenco"), a privately-owned
Toronto-based manufacturer, remanufacturer and distributor of new and
remanufactured aftermarket auto parts. In connection with these loans, we had an
option to acquire a substantial ownership interest in Fenco. In May 2011, pursuant to
a purchase agreement with FAPL Holdings Inc. ("FAPL"), Fenco's parent company,
and certain other individuals, we acquired all of the outstanding equity of FAPL's
subsidiaries. In connection with this acquisition, we advanced an additional
$10,000,000 to Fenco. We believe this transaction provides us opportunities to
expand beyond our existing product lines of alternators and starters and further
enhance our market presence in North America (see Note 3 and Note 22 to the
consolidated financial statements).


Fenco produced and sold a variety of "undercar" parts, including brakes, steering, and
driveline, and had a re-manufacturing business model to that of MPAA. It was the
company's largest acquisition to date.


MPAA quickly ran into trouble with its new subsidiary. In November of 2011, the
company delivered a late filing notice for its FQ2 2012 filing, citing difficulty adjusting
and closing the books for Fenco. In February of 2012, it issued another late filing notice.
Subsequent lawsuits alleged that during this period, MPAA had discovered accounting
irregularities at Fenco but failed to disclose it. A complaint later filed against MPAA by
M&T Bank, a lender to Fenco, is worth quoting at length:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036111052835/doc1.htm

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036112006927/doc1.htm
On February 13, 2014, MPA filed a lawsuit [Motorcar Parts of America, Inc. v. FAPL
Holdings Inc. et al., CV 14-1153 (VBK)]… alleging, among other things, that FAPL
and its former principals ("Fenwick Principals") fraudulently induced MPA to purchase
the Fenwick entities by misrepresenting their financial condition… Specifically MPA
has alleged that FAPL inflated revenue claims by, among other things: (A) failing to
take into account core returns; (B) directed customers not to return cores until after
the Fenwick acquisition so that liabilities would not be reflected in the financial
statements; and (C) failed to account for substantial customer rebates and
allowances, including discounts and fil-rate penalties… Based on its post-Fenwick
acquisition internal review and analysis, MPA concluded that the Fenwick Entities net
assets had a fair market value that was approximately $63 million less than what
MPA had initially calculated...


Despite this knowledge, at the same time MPA was seeking extensions of credit and
loan accommodations from M&T… MPA failed to disclose to M&T the information it
had discovered concerning the Fenwick Entities true financial condition and the
unreliability of their financial information...


MPA continued to use the inaccurate financial information concerning the Fenwick
Entities in submitting Borrowing Base Certificates to, and seeking extensions of credit
and loan accommodations from, M&T...


In early January 2013, Joffe and Matrenec met with representatives of M&T seeking
certain loan and covenant accommodations. They did not reveal to M&T then, or at
any other time, the results of MPA's internal investigation regarding the Fenwick
Entities financial condition.


I've included a screenshot of these pages of the lawsuit below:

The M&T Bank lawsuit was later settled for $9.25 million, net of insurance proceeds, per
the 2017 10-K.


Finally, in March of 2012, MPAA released its 10-Q and dropped a bomb on its
shareholders. The document describes the debacle in tortured legalese, some of which I
quote below:


The estimated fair value of Fenco tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed are based on provisional estimates and assumptions... In
accordance with ASC 805, during the measurement period an acquirer shall
retrospectively adjust the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date to
reflect information obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the
acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the measurement of the amounts
recognized as of that date... Based on new information available about facts and
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date, the Company has further
adjusted the recognition of certain assets and liabilities as of that date. The
preliminary estimate of assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in connection with
the acquisition, reclassification adjustments, exchange related adjustments, and the
subsequent change in valuation estimates made in the second quarter are presented
in the following table. These second quarter adjustments to the provisional amounts
previously recorded were made retrospectively to the acquisition date and included
adjustments to some of its valuation estimates related primarily to inventory,
including long-term core inventory, inventory reserves, accounts receivable
reserves, and the customer core returns accrual.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/9/4/40228756-15676256874108422_origin.png

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036112013847/form10q.htm
Once again, the accounting for cores was deficient, resulting in a significant
overstatement of assets on the balance sheet. The table showing the adjustment in
valuation is below:


The fair value of assets, estimated at an already meager $544,000, was reduced to
negative $32.4 million because the original estimate of the liabilities for core returns was
off by a whopping $25.8 million. It is worth noting that the total adjustment shown in the
10-Q filing is about half the $63 million cited in the M&T lawsuit. Here is footnote 2 to the
table above in its entirety.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/30/40228756-15671919242609053_origin.png
The estimated fair value of the customer core return liabilities assumed by the
Company in connection with the acquisition is included in customer core returns
accrual in the accompanying balance sheet at September 30, 2011. The change to
original estimates was due to additional third party confirmation of such
liabilities for customers holding unreturned cores. The additional confirmations
identified actual product net pricing which is the basis for return credits and inventory
turn rates with specific customers, which resulted in a higher estimate of the fair value
of customer core return liabilities than had previously been estimated. The Company
classifies the portion of core liability related to the core inventory purchased and on
the shelves of its customers as long-term liabilities. Upon the sale of a
remanufactured core a core liability is created to record the obligation to
provide the Company's customer with a credit upon the return of a like core by
the customer. Since the return of a core is based on the sale of a remanufactured
automobile part to an end user of the Company's customer, the offset to this core
liability generated by its return to the Company by its customer is usually followed by
the sale of a replacement remanufactured auto part, and thus a portion of the core
liability is continually outstanding and is recorded as long-term. The amount the
Company has classified as long term is the portion that management projects will
remain outstanding for an uninterrupted period extending one year from the balance
sheet date.


I have quoted this footnote at length because it sounds identical to MPAA's current
business and accounting practices, which we will get to shortly.


During 2012, MPAA invested another $20 million in Fenco, but this was not enough. On
July 9, 2013, Fenco filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, wiping out a nearly $70 million
investment in total for MPAA. Besides M&T, several suppliers of Fenco later sued MPAA
for unpaid bills.

The 2015 10-K tells us that insiders at MPAA used the debacle as yet another way to
pay themselves through related party transactions:


During the years ended March 31, 2014 and 2013, the Company paid $304,000 and
$ 350,000, respectively, to Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Capital, Inc. in
connection with the restructuring of the discontinued subsidiary. Scott Adelson, a
member of the Company's Board of Directors, is a Co-President and Global Co-Head
of Corporate Finance for Houlihan Lokey Howard & Zukin Capital, Inc.


Once again, the inventory accounting scandal nearly caused a bankruptcy, but MPAA
was able to skate by thanks to the leniency of its lenders. The 2014 10-K notes that:

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036114025769/form10k.htm
Over the past several years, we have violated a number of the financial and other
covenants contained in our credit agreements, including our current financing
agreement with a syndicate of lenders, Cerberus Business Finance, LLC, as
collateral agent, and PNC Bank, National Association, as administrative agent. Our
most recent waiver was in June 2013.


For its part, the SEC clearly believed that MPAA's disclosures regarding its covenant
defaults and wavers were inadequate because this was the subject of repeated
correspondence with the company. In fact, in all of my experience researching potential
shorts, I have never seen a company with quite so much or such lengthy SEC
correspondence, including a CORRESP filing regarding a 2007 S-1 registration with a
whopping 49 bullet points.


A table of insider sales and a chart of the company's price performance over the
relevant period are below:

In the wake of the Fenco accounting scandal, MPAA stock lost approximately 75% of its
value. The rebound at the end of the time series appears to be a relief rally after the
company contained the problem by taking Fenco bankrupt.

Inventory Accounting - The Core Exchange Program


Source: Barchart.com chart of the stock price from May 12, 2011, when MPAA
announced the Fenco acquisition through July 9, 2013, when Fenco filed for bankruptcy.


If there's one thing that MPAA's history tells us, it is that we should pay very close
attention to the inventory accounting, especially the accounting for "cores" since both
the episodes I just reviewed revolve around this issue. At the moment, the core assets
and liabilities stick out on the balance sheet like a sore thumb and have resulted in a
large gap between earnings and cash flow. In this section, I will explain my
understanding of MPAA's accounting for the Core Exchange program, and in the next
section, I will go over the balance sheet and financial ratios, which ought to alarm any
investor in this company.


MPAA has a complex process for accounting for its core exchange program. It divides a
replacement part into a reusable "core" and a value-added "unit." Every time it sells a re-
manufactured replacement part, it records an asset and a liability representing the used
core that it expects to receive and the rebate it expects to give the customer. When it
receives the core, it re-manufactures it into a new part, which is once again divided into
a core and a unit value. Unlike "normal" accounting for sales and inventory, the core
portion of the finished product does not fully exit the balance sheet when a sale takes
place.
Given the complexity of this section and the next one, I will state the conclusion right
now: MPAA has negative cash flow. Its earnings are the result of the accounting for the
core exchange program, which has resulted in a massive buildup of net "core" assets on
the balance sheet, and I believe that the valuation attached to these assets is dubious.


To begin, let me review how inventory accounting usually works. A manufacturing
company buys raw materials, puts them through the manufacturing process, and then
sells them. The raw materials are accounted for at cost and the finished goods are
accounted for as the raw material cost plus the cost of manufacturing. When the
company sells its inventory, it debits cash, credits finished goods inventory, and credits
shareholders equity with the difference (gross profit). On the income statement, the sale
price (less any reserve) is the revenue, and the credit to finished inventory goods shows
up as COGS. There are some nuances (LIFO, FIFO, Avg Cost), but the concepts are
simple enough to be explained in half a session of an introductory accounting class.


Instead of this simple accounting, MPAA divides its inventory into 6 separate line items,
two of which are liabilities: net inventory, inventory unreturned, contract assets, long-
term contract assets, contract liabilities, and long-term contract liabilities. The long-term
accounts have an expected lifespan of over a year, which is a remarkable duration given
that we're talking about replacement auto parts. The value of some of these line items
has been exploding over time, resulting in a growing difference between MPAA's
cumulative reported earnings and cash flow. In this section, I will explain my
understanding of how MPAA's inventory accounting works based on company filings,
and MPAA's own 20-minute video on the core exchange program.


First, some definitions. It is important to remember these to avoid confusion.


Customers: These are the auto parts stores that purchase parts from MPAA.


Consumers: These are the end buyers of the product, i.e. the people who need to
replace parts on their cars or trucks


A replacement part is separated into two components:


Core: The broken-down part, which is an input to the re-manufacturing process. The
term "core" is also used to refer to the portion of a finished product that could be reused
in the re-manufacturing process at some point in the future.



http://www.motorcarparts.com/news/new-video-by-mpa-explains-the-core-exchange-process/
Unit: The value-add necessary to turn a core into a finished product, which consists of
replacement components, labor, and overhead employed in the re-manufacturing
process.


A finished part is a core + a unit.

Now, this is where things start to get complicated. When MPAA makes a sale to its
customers (auto part retailers), the full value of the inventory does not leave the balance
sheet. The value is separated out into "core" and "unit" components, and the "core"
remains on the balance sheet under the line item "Re-manufactured cores held at
customer locations." The customer then makes the final sale of the re-manufactured part
(core + unit) to the consumer. At that point, MPAA assigns a probability to whether a
core will be returned by the consumer (e.g. Joe Mechanic brings back his old alternator)
to the customer (e.g. Autozone) and then by the customer to MPAA. The probability that
the core is returned multiplied by the value of the core stays on MPAA's balance sheet
under the account "Used cores expected to be returned by customers." The probability
that the core is not returned multiplied by the value of the core is recorded as additional
net revenue.

There are two different categories within the core exchange program: the "Full" core
exchange and the "Zero" core exchange.


In the "Full" program, MPAA:


1) records a sale for the unit


2) charges the customer a deposit for the core


3) records a sale for the anticipated under-returned cores.


Once the core is returned to MPAA, the company credits the customer for the value of a
Core, refurbishes it, and the process begins anew.

Source: Screenshots of MPAA Core Exchange Program Video


Under the "Zero" program:


1) MPAA's finished goods (core + unit) are held in consignment with the customer until
sold


2) MPAA does not charge the customer a deposit for the Core


3) The customer pays for a Core if/when a Core is not returned to the customer.

Occasionally, when researching a potential short, I experience something I call a "fall out
of the chair" moment. I experienced such a moment 17 minutes and 9 seconds into the
core exchange accounting video:

Remember, assets = liabilities + shareholders equity, and assets include "non-returned
cores" that are expected to be returned… but "MPAA does not directly manage, if or
when that core will be returned." This is a very interesting asset.
The balance sheet and cash conversion cycle


From a cash flow perspective, two things about this really stand out. First, when MPAA
puts its parts on consignment at its customers' locations, it is effectively financing its
customers' inventory. Second, when MPAA does not charge the customer a deposit for
the core and "does not directly manage if or when a core will be returned," it is
effectively making a loan to its customers at zero interest rate for an indeterminate
length of time. The result of these business practices stretches out MPAA's cash
conversion cycle and turns the company into the financier of its customers' inventory
costs. The practice is accommodated on the income statement and balance sheet
through the "core" accounts. Amounts are shuffled between these various assets and
liabilities, but the core does not actually leave the company's balance sheet when a sale
is made. Let me repeat that: when a core is sold, the "core" portion of the finished good
does not fully exit the balance sheet through cost of goods sold - the probability of the
return times the core value stays put. Over time, the core accounts increase with sales
to customers and decrease with the provision for inventory obsolescence, the probability
that a core is not returned, and periodic core revaluation write-downs. The core
revaluation write-downs have been growing, as shown for the last quarter and 3 fiscal
years in the table below:


Source: Company Filings. Figures are in thousands.


The line items representing "cores" have grown on MPAA's balance sheet to the point
where they represent a very large part of the company's total assets and shareholder's
equity. The effect of having so much of this inventory line item has been to slow down
inventory turnover and extend the company's cash conversion cycle, which is way out of
line with its peer group.


Now that we've gone over the core exchange program, let's look at MPAA's inventory on
its balance sheet as of the quarter ended June 30, 2019 (FQ1), as shown in the filings.

Source: June 30, 2019, 10-Q


In addition to line items related to the Core Exchange Program, there are 3 more items
here that require an explanation, which I found in the 2019 10-K:


Upfront payments to customers represent the marketing allowances, such as sign-
on bonuses, slotting fees, and promotional allowances provided to our customers.
These allowances are recognized as an asset and amortized over the appropriate
period of time as a reduction of revenue if we expect to generate future revenues
associated with the upfront payment.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2019/8/30/40228756-15671923285981562_origin.png

https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/918251/000114036119011947/hc10002514x1_10k.htm
Core premiums paid to customers represent the difference between the
Remanufactured Core acquisition price purchased from customers generally in
connection with new business, and the related Used Core cost, which is treated as an
asset and recognized as a reduction of revenue through the later of the date at
which related revenue is recognized or the date at which the sales incentive is
offered. We consider, among other things, the length of our largest ongoing customer
relationships, duration of customer contracts, and the average life of vehicles on the
road in determining the appropriate period of time over which to amortize these
premiums.


Customer allowances earned includes all marketing allowances provided to
customers. Such allowances include sales incentives and concessions. Voluntary
marketing allowances related to a single exchange of product are recorded as a
reduction of revenues at the time the related revenues are recorded or when such
incentives are offered. Other marketing allowances, which may only be applied
against future purchases, are recorded as a reduction to revenues in accordance
with a schedule set forth in the relevant contract. Sales incentive amounts are
recorded based on the value of the incentive provided. Customer allowances earned
are considered to be short-term contract liabilities.


Upfront payments, core premiums, and customer allowances all represent concessions
to MPAA's customers that are amortized or accreted as a reduction in revenue on the
income statement. This accounting practice reduces reported revenue and increases
gross profit as a percent of reported revenue.


I computed a "net" inventory number by adding up the inventory and contract asset line
items in the table and subtracting the related liabilities. This number stood at an
astonishing $434.2 million at the end of June 2019, compared with $490.3 million of
reported net sales and $388.6 million of reported COGS on a trailing 12-month basis. I
used this net inventory computation to calculate inventory days (using cost of goods
sold). It is plotted below, along with days sales outstanding, payable days, and the
company's cash conversion cycle. I also plotted a comparison of MPAA's inventory days
with a peer group consisting of U.S. Auto Parts Network (PRTS), Stoneridge (SRI),
Standard Motor Products (SMP), Dorman Products (DORM), and Sorl Auto Parts
(SORL). See if you can spot the outlier.

the sum of COGS over the last 4 quarters, multiplied by 365. The inventory figures for
MPAA include the balances for "core" accounts included in contract assets and contract
liabilities, per the calculation in the table above. The other companies do not have
contract assets and liabilities on their balance sheets.

The cash flow tells a different story from the earnings, and
it's not pretty


It might look like there was some improvement in 2013, but a close look at the annual
filings tells a different story. The 2013 10-K, which was filed late, shows that the
unwinding of the Fenco accounting debacle resulted in both an increase in revenue and
a decrease in the long-term "core" inventory, according to the MD&A:


Fenco's core inventory levels and core returns accrual were decreased as it
recognized approximately $50,783,000 in revenue from the reduction in it's [sic]
obligation to provide a credit for a major customer's Remanufactured Cores which
were previously recorded as a long-term core liability and $31,649,000 of the related
long-term core inventory previously recorded in the consolidated balance sheet were
recognized as cost of goods sold during fiscal 2013. Additionally, there was an
increase in accounts receivables and a decrease in our accounts payable balances in
our undercar product line segment.


Skeptical financial analysts should always take a careful look at the cash flow statement.
In 2013, MPAA reported a net loss of $6.8 million (excluding an $84.7 million impairment
expense), but cash used in operations was $38.5 million, including $5 million used by
the rotating electrical segment.


In FY 2014, the size of the inventory balance resumed its upward march, but the effect
on inventory days was offset by an increase in net sales.


MPAA's core accounting has caused its cash flow to diverge significantly from its
reported earnings. MPAA has been plugging the gap by taping its revolving credit line
and factoring receivables. Leverage and interest expense have been increasing.


According to the excellent book "Beyond Earnings", the statement "Earnings are an
opinion. Cash flow is a fact" was once graffitied on the New York Subway. As I alluded
to, the cash flow from operations and the net income of MPAA tell a very different story.
Here is a chart of the annual data.

Ordinarily, cash flow from operations should exceed net income because the latter
contains depreciation, amortization, and stock-based compensation and the former is
not reduced by capital expenditures. For MPAA, the sum of net income over the last 5
years has been $72.1 million, and the sum of cash flow from operations has been
negative $53.7 million.


To examine the effect of MPAA's unusual accounting, it is important to compare the
income statement to the statement of cash flows. Over any significant period of time, the
following relationship should roughly hold:


Here are a chart and table of this relationship for MPAA versus the peer group. For each
company, I added up EBITDA over the last 5 years starting with the most recently ended
quarter and compared it with CFFO + Tax Provision + Interest expense, where the tax
provision and interest expense are taken from the income statement. Once again, see if
you can spot the outlier.

period) end date.


Remember that shareholders equity is equal to assets minus liabilities. If the company is
producing net income and is not making cash payments to shareholders, either assets
are increasing or liabilities are decreasing. At this point, you can probably guess what's
going on at MPAA, but here's a chart to help visualize it:
Source: My calculations using CapitalIQ data. The data points are from annual filings,
but I also included the most recent quarter ended June 30, 2019. Note that "contract
assets" and "contract liabilities" are the names of the items on the balance sheet after
the adoption of ASC 606. In prior years, these items were explicitly labeled as "core"
accounts, e.g. "long term core inventory."


To fund the cash burn, MPAA has been drawing its revolving credit line and factoring
receivables.


In June 2019, MPAA amended its credit facility for a second time to increase the
borrowing capacity from $200 million to $238.6 million. At the end of FQ1 2020 (June
30, 2019), the company had drawn the revolver for $135 million. In the same quarter a
year earlier, MPAA had a balance of only $54 million on the revolver. The company's
leverage ratio applicable to the debt covenants has been increasing, as shown in the
10-Q filings.

Source: FQ1 2019 10-Q


The other source of cash has been factoring receivables. The most recent numbers and
a year over year comparison are shown in the table below:


Source: FQ1 2020 10-Q


Lastly, MPAA has a term loan with a $27.2 million principal balance as of June 30, 2019.
The company's net debt position (total debt - cash & equivalents) per the June 2019
balance sheet was $149 million versus $59 million one year earlier. Quarterly Interest
expense rose from $6.9 million to $7.9 million over the same period.


As of June 30, 2019, liquidity consisted of $103.6 million of remaining capacity on the
revolver, $13.2 million of cash, and $45 million of receivables that could be sold through
the factoring program. Over the last 12 months, the company burned through a total of
$82.5 million in cash, including $57.8 million of cash used in operations, and $13.6
million and $11.1 million spent on capital expenditures and acquisitions, respectively. At
the current run rate, the company will run out of liquidity in just over 2 years, unless it
trips its covenants first.


Given MPAA's suspect accounting and negative cash flow from operations, the growing
debt and declining liquidity ought to alarm both equity investors and creditors to the
company. They seem to be starting to take note:

The REMY Transaction - a benchmark for both valuation and
accounting

The trades of Kevin Daly, the Chief Accounting Officer, are worthy of special attention.

ownership of the company down to zero in June 2017.

market transactions.
BorgWarner (BWA) sold its aftermarket business unit to Torque Capital Group in 2016.
The valuation multiple for that transaction implies a negative market value for MPAA. In
addition, BorgWarner's management said that the aftermarket business had zero
margin, which supports my view that MPAA's earnings are likely overstated.


Trying to put a value on MPAA is difficult because, as you may have gathered by now, I
don't trust its reported income statement and its cash flows are negative. It may be
impossible to estimate what Motorcar Parts of America's earnings would look like
without the Core Exchange Program, but it's possible to compare it to a similar company
in the industry that was sold in 2016.


BorgWarner sold its REMY light vehicle aftermarket business to Torque Capital Group in
October 2016 for $80 million. REMY is the third-largest player in the replacement/re-
manufacturing business for rotating electrical, which is MPAA's #1 revenue-generating
product line. The business unit also has operations in Europe and a power steering
business in North America. At the time of the sale, the REMY aftermarket business did
about $300 million of revenue, per a comment by BWA management. If we assume an
annual run rate of 300m, that puts the P/S ratio at 0.27, which I'll round up to 0.3.


At the Wells Fargo Industrial and Construction Conference held in NYC in May 2017,
BorgWarner's CFO Ronald Hundzinski had the following exchange with Richard Kwas,
an equity research analyst at WF:


Ronald T. Hundzinski BorgWarner Inc. - CFO and EVP: It [REMY] was the largest
acquisition BorgWarner has ever done. It was a little over $1 billion, $1.5 billion. The
margin profile, which you alluded to people questioned, at -- it was about a 4%
business. Now we subsequently sold the aftermarket business that was roughly
about 1/3 of it...


Richard Michael Kwas Wells Fargo Securities, LLC: No margin...


Ronald T. Hundzinski: No, no margin. And that aftermarket business was for light
vehicle and it was really, the channels were to retail outlets, so like AutoZone, for
example. That's somewhere BorgWarner doesn't play. We don't play in those
markets. So we sold that business. So what's remaining basically is we sold roughly
almost $300 million of sales with no margin. So that gave us about 100 basis points
of [margin] improvement for us alone.

It should be noted that REMY did not have complex accounting for cores or separately
broken out core assets and liabilities on its balance sheet in its 2015 SEC filings, which
were its last as a public company before it was purchased by BorgWarner.


If we apply an EV to Sales ratio of 0.3 to MPAA, that would imply a negative market
value.


Source: My calculations


MPAA has had two share price collapses and near-bankruptcies that were the result of
improper accounting for cores. I strongly suspect that this will be a trilogy and that the
third installment will happen soon. The core items on the balance sheet are bloated, the
cash flow from operations has been negative for 4 of the last 5 years, and leverage is
reaching an unsustainable level. MPAA delayed the filing of its 10-Q for September 30,
2018, and its FY 2019 10-K. Delayed filings occurred in both prior episodes, and while
the company has released its financials, the repeated delays seem to me to be a sign of
trouble. Other signals include insider selling, the material weakness in internal control
over financial reporting (disclosed in the 10-K), and the increasing size of core
revaluation write-downs over the last 3 years.
