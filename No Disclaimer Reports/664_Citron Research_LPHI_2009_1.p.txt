CITRON RESEARCH LOOKS
BEHIND THE CURTAIN AT
THE BUSINESS OF LIFE
PARTNERS –
(NASDAQ:LPHI)


For investors, this Life Partner might not
be good for you …


Life Partners is a viatical/life insurance settlement
provider based in Waco, Texas.   LPHI acts as
dealmaker – it arranges for buyouts of life
insurance policies in cases where the death of the
policyholder can be anticipated within a �nite
timespan.  It earns fees by connecting these
potential settlors with investors, who agree to front
the money and pay the premiums, in exchange for
rights to the policy bene�t face amount, which is
received following the settlor’s subsequent death. 
Clients are mostly individuals who are referred to
Life Partners through �nancial planners, lawyers,
insurance agents and CPA’s.


It is the belief of Citron that this company has too
many red �ags that investors are advised to
consider carefully: 


  Red Flag # 1. Egregious fees. 


We believe Life Partners is charging their retail
investor clients egregious fees.  Are LPHI’s clients
getting a good deal?  It is hard to believe.  LPHI
makes money by connecting sellers and buyers of
life insurance policies and collecting an upfront fee.

However, it is di�cult to understand how clients of
Life Partners can make attractive or even positive
returns when fees of $500,000 per transaction are
layered into the IRR calculation. 


Below let’s explore some transaction statistics from
LPHI’s most recent quarter:


  Q3-09 as of
11/30/2008


Revenues 28,103,930


Brokerage and referral fees 13,857,587


Revenue, net of brokerage fees 14,246,343


   


Face value of policies settled 195,459,950

Average face value per policy 3,490,356


Average fees per settlement 501,856


Fee as a percentage of policy
face value


14.38%


Average fee split to broker  247,457


Average fee retained by LPHI 254,399

Citron’s �rst question is whether this level of fee
income is even remotely sustainable.  How does the
company garner such a big piece of the settlement
pie for itself ?  When a company out-margins its
competition by hundreds of percent, investors
should understand the business model.  There had
better be a signi�cant competitive edge, and a high
barrier to entry, or competition will rapidly erode
those margins. 


A recent lawsuit by the Colorado Securities
Commissioner provides signi�cant insight into how
LPHI has been operating. 


As you can see above LPHI’s gross commissions
were 14.4% of the face value face in 3Q09 (ended
11/30/08).  Yet, according to the Wall Street Journal,
“life-settlement brokers often pocket the lesser of
6% of a policy’s face value or 30% of the gross sale
price.” 
http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122653499451222557.html
[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122653499451222557.htm
.  If you invest in a policy through LPHI, however,
you are paying nearly two-and-a-half times the
customary industry fee level. 


According to Sanford Bernstein, investors of life
settlements typically seek target IRR’s of 9% to 13%. 
http://www.schnetwork.com/pdfs/bernstein.pdf
[http://www.schnetwork.com/pdfs/bernstein.pdf] . 
However, Life Partners has promised as high as a
16% IRR on their investments, according to their
radio adds.    
(
http://www.dora.state.co.us/securities/pdf_forms/enforcem
summaryorder.pdf
[http://www.dora.state.co.us/securities/pdf_forms/enforcem
summaryorder.pdf] )


If LPHI is forced to cut margins even by half to
approach industry norms, its net pro�t will sink by
63%.


And it gets even more �shy here.


 Red Flag # 2. Are those fees sustainable? 


Is this high fee level sustainable?  Or in other words,
how does LPHI get away with their egregious fees

and still provide higher than market IRR’s to their
investors?


In our opinion, they are not.  They can only be
carving out such huge fees by concealment:


1. Failing to disclose their fees transparently
to the investors and settlors


2. Preventing the transaction from being
priced competitively by any sort of bidding
process


3. … and worst, not disclosing the true
actuarial life expectancy of the insured (the
largest single factor impacting the ultimate
percentage IRR on the investment ) 
(http://www.dora.state.co.us/dora_pages/n
[http://www.dora.state.co.us/dora_pages/n
)


While Life Partners may be better than other
providers at �nding attractive policies, with 90% of
volume (according to their 10-K) coming from
brokers, it appears that they are partnering with
brokers and insurance agents to thwart a
competitive bidding process. 


In the above example, assuming the transaction is
completed at 35% of face value ($1.2mm), LPHI’s
clients are paying $500k of upfront transaction fees,
or over 40% of the gross sale price.  Note that LPHI
takes its entire fee upfront, while the investor will
not �nd out how the true investment performance
for years down the road.  According to the May
2007 complaint �led by the Colorado Securities
Commissioner against Life Partners alleging
violations of the Colorado Securities Act, Insurance
Commissioner alleges that LPHI:


“failed to disclose to investors the method
by which life expectancy was determined;
the high frequency rate in which viators
outlived the life expectancies predicted by
Life Partners.”


“It is further alleged that Life Partners
failed to disclose the original purchase
price of the policy and commissions paid to

the sales agents, making it impossible for
an investor to determine the true market
value of the policy.”


Therefore. investors do not know their cost basis or
how much of their “investment” is being pocketed
by LPHI. 


The need to conceal the fee structure is so central
to LPHI’s operation that even last week LPHI’s CEO
would not give any information on his fee structure
to a Wall Street Journal writer who was doing a pu�
piece on the company.


’Life Partners Chief Executive Brian Pardo
declined to give speci�cs of the fee
structure or the size of lump-sum
payments, which vary according to
“underwriting factors”. ‘

As a comparative data point, investors are
encouraged to consider the fate of National
Financial Partners, which owns Advanced
Settlements, the largest life broker in country.  They
are famously run by Jessica Bibliowicz, the daughter
of Sandy Weill.  Yet, looking at their stock price in
the $2 range tells us that the market for life
settlements have cooled and their margins have
been compressed.  It is the opinion of Citron that
this is the eventual future of LPHI.

In addition, LPHI shares a portion of the fees with
their licensees and selling brokers.  In its 2007 10-K,
LPHI disclosed it paid one licensee over $6 million
and two brokers over $4.5 million dollars.  LPHI is
not the only company getting rich at expense of
individual investors.  The Colorado lawsuit
increases the regulatory risk for these brokers and
licensees as well.  The Colorado lawsuit names 10

of these brokers and licensees’ in its lawsuit.  This
notoriety may disincentive others from entering
into these cozy relationships with LPHI. 


http://www.dora.state.co.us/dora_pages/newsreleases/LifeP
[http://www.dora.state.co.us/dora_pages/newsreleases/Life


This explains why the lawsuits piling up in states
across the country are so signi�cant.  As LPHI is
found to be selling securities in state after state,
and requiring insurance licensing in others, it faces
a burden of disclosure which will force exactly
those fee disclosures that will narrow its margins. 


There is a consistent movement by states and
regulatory bodies to license life settlement activity,
cap fees and increase disclosure of fees.  We
believe litigation in Colorado, which went to trial in
December 2008 is representative of legal pressures
in many venues, and judging by LPHI’s business
practices, is well justi�ed.   Other states have gone
after Life Partners, including Virginia and the Utah
Division of Securities.


Life Partners is licensed only in the state of Texas
and a handful of others, and most notably absent is
Florida, the largest life settlement state.  But more
and more states are requiring life settlement
providers to be licensed in their state. 


There are only 12 license providers in the State of
Florida : 
(http://www.�dfs.com/data/CompanySearch/index.asp
[http://www.�dfs.com/data/CompanySearch/index.asp]
   (Company Type “Viatical Settlement Provider”). 


In July 2007, Florida issued a cease and desist order
against Great West Growth, an unlicensed life
settlements provider
(http://www.�oir.com/pdf/GreatWestGrowth_CeaseandDesi
[http://www.�oir.com/pdf/GreatWestGrowth_CeaseandDes
). Great West was conducting business in Florida by
using a licensed provider, Life Equity, to act as a
fronting agent for Great West. 


LPHI also operates in Florida … without a license.  


“On March 28, 2008, LPI �led a declaratory
judgment action in the United States District

Court for the Northern District of Florida to
determine whether LPI is required to be
licensed as a life settlement provider in order
to purchase policies from Florida residents. 
We claimed that the Florida O�ce of
Insurance Regulation does not have
jurisdiction over LPI and that to assert just
jurisdiction violates the Commerce Clause,
Contracts Clause, and the Due Process
Clause of the United States Constitution.  On
December 1, 2008, the District Court
dismissed all of our claims except the due
process claim.  The matter is still ongoing.”


Yet, in fairness to the company, they do disclose
this risk clearly to investors in their 10Q through the
all important line that some might overlook


“Some states are moving to license life settlement
brokerage activity, which may result in the capping
of fees or great disclosure of fees, either of which
would tend to lower the fees.”


Obviously this all provides signi�cant business risk
to LPHI … and its lofty margins.


 Red Flag # 3.   Management track record


Past indiscretions by management, including
accounting abuses and other issues increase the
risks for investors in LPHI. 


We have a CEO previously sanctioned by the SEC
for materially misrepresenting �nancial results.  In
the 90’s,  LPHI’s CEO was the CEO of American Solar
King, which had a spectacular rise and fall (from
over $90 per share to bankruptcy).  It seems the
CEO arranged for sales to dealers �nanced by huge
uncollectible receivables.  Speci�cally, the
Complaint alleges that defendants violated the
antifraud and reporting provisions of the securities
laws and that the CEO made false statements to the
company’s auditors, materially overstating the
company’s revenues and pro�ts.  OOPS!

 Red Flag # 4.   Who’s minding the store?


Who is minding the store now?  LPHI’s auditor is a
tiny �rm with a really small public company
practice.   And we mean really small.

Citron notes that the auditor fees paid by LPHI to

In the wake of the accountants’ role in the Mado�
scandal, investors and regulators clearly need to be
mindful of whether the protection assumed to be
provided by independent auditors is su�cient to
provide investor protection within the given
context.  Remember that we’re considering a $400
million market cap company here.


Further the independent director in charge of the
audit committee is Tad M. Ballantyne.  Mr.
Ballantyne has a colorful background with a variety
of pink sheet penny stock companies, one of which
is a “Republic of Mauritius” corporation, plus and a
bean canning plant in the Midwest. 


We’re concerned that this lack of oversight leaves
LPHI’s receivables and net revenues open to
“management”. 


 Red Flag # 5.  Analyst coverage?


Interestingly enough only one �rm “covers” Life
Partners:  Taglich Brothers.   The only thing Citron
can say is to look at the history of companies
covered by Taglich … did we mention that the
company pays Taglich $21,000 per year for “the
creation and dissemination of research reports” ?


 Red Flag # 6.  Competition


Major competitors in the viatical settlement sector
include: Maple Life, Peachtree, Coventry First, Life
Settlement Solutions, and Life Equity.  The �ve
major providers have adopted “the full disclosure
model”.  And now, an online auction site, Cantor
Fitzgerald’s LexNet, brings even more transparency
to the process of matching investors and settlors
for fees of only 1% to 2% vs. 14% from LPHI. 


 Red Flag # 7.   Life Insurers: no longer “The
Rock”


Life insurers are under enormous distress due to
the �nancial crisis.  In years past, investors in
viatical settlements could assume with certainty
that the policies in which they invested bore no
counterparty risk.  But those days are gone.  Nearly
every major life insurer is at risk of “insolvency” due

to crisis of toxic real estate paper.  The debt of
several major insurance companies is already
trading at distressed levels.  In fact, potential
investors can get similar returns by buying
insurance company debt, without the mortality risk
of viatical settlements.


Perhaps this is why there seems to be a current
shortage of viatical investors.  That “risk-free” 16%
might not look so risk-free if the investor has to ask
“Which will survive longer, the insured or their
insurance company?”


Conclusion


Just two years ago, LPHI was an OTCBB stock that
had never traded over $10.  With its colorful CEO,
lack of management oversight, tiny 30-employee
operational footprint and string of regulatory
troubles, it falls far short of the standard of
accountability and transparency required of mid-
cap Nasdaq companies.  From an actuarial
perspective, we’d say the odds are this one is
terminal. 


Cautious investing to all.
