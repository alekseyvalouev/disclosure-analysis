Capitec: A wolf in sheep’s clothing 
Based on our research and due diligence, we believe that Capitec is a loan shark with 
massively understated defaults masquerading as a community microfinance provider.  We 
believe that the South African Reserve Bank & Minister of Finance should immediately place 
Capitec into curatorship.  


Capitec Bank Holdings Limited (JSE: CPI) is a South Africa-focused microfinance provider to a majority low-


income demographic, yet they out-earn all major commercial banks globally including competing high-risk 


lenders. We don’t buy this story. Viceroy believes this is indicative of predatory finance which we have 


corroborated with substantial on-the-ground discussions with Capitec ex-employees, former customers, and 


individuals familiar with the business. 


Viceroy’s extensive due diligence and compiled evidence suggests that indicates Capitec must take significant 


impairments to its loans which will likely result in a net-liability position. We believe Capitec’s concealed 


problems largely resemble those seen at African Bank Investments (JSE: AXL) prior to its collapse in 2014.  


We think that it’s only a matter of time before Capitec’s financials and business unravel, with macro headwinds 


creating an exponential risk of default and bankruptcy.  


This report will provide underlying information and analysis we believe supports the following conclusions: 


▪ Reconciliation of loan book values, maturity profiles and cash outflows imply Capitec is either fabricating 


new loans and collections, or re-financing ~ZAR 2.5bn – 3bn (US$200m-$240m) in principal per year by 


issuing new loans to defaulting clients.  


▪ Legal documents obtained by Viceroy show Capitec advising and approving loans to delinquent customers 


in order to repay existing loans. These documents also show Capitec engaging in reckless lending practices 


as defined by South Africa’s National Credit Act. This corroborates Viceroy’s loan book analysis.  


▪ As a consequence of re-financing delinquent loans, Viceroy believes Capitec’s loan book is massively 


overstated. Viceroy’s analysis against competitors suggests an impairment/write-off impact of ZAR 11bn 


will more accurately represent the delinquencies and risk in Capitec’s portfolio. 


▪ Legal experts that we have spoken to believe that the outcome of an upcoming reckless and predatory 


lending test case in March 2018 will be used to trigger a multi-party litigation refund (class action). We 


believe that, at a minimum, Capitec will be required to refund predatory origination fees primarily related 


to multi-loan facilities; an estimated ZAR 12.7bn.  


▪ Viceroy’s investigations suggest that Capitec’s prohibited and discontinued multi-loan facility lives on, 


rebranded as a “Credit Facility”. Former Capitec employees have corroborated this. Despite its perception 


as an affordable lender, Capitec’s implied interest rates are significantly true of the maximum allowable 


rates in South Africa. 


▪ South Africa’s microfinancing sector has been the graveyard of numerous Capitec competitors who chased 


the same meteoric growth Capitec displays, largely due to low acceptance and mass delinquencies. We see 


no operational difference between Capitec and its ill-fated predecessors, including African Bank. 


▪ Former employees consider the business to still be an outright loan-shark operation, where fees are key. 


Some former employees believe they were fired for not deceiving borrowers and failing to meet 


rescheduling targets on impaired/defaulting loans. 


▪ Jean Pierre Verster, chairman of Capitec’s audit committee, is/was indirectly short Capitec through 


Steinhoff. We believe this is an oversight, and understand Verster to be an excellent analyst on the short 


side. We encourage Verster to raise the concerns within this report to company auditors and recognize 


Capitec’s resemblance to his previous African Bank short.  


Given what we believe is a massive overstatement of financial assets and income, together with opaque 


reporting of loan cash flow and reckless lending practices, we believe Capitec is simply uninvestable and 


accordingly have not assigned a target price.

1 Background  


Capitec 
Capitec was formed in 1999 by South African investment holding group PSG through the combination of several 


microfinance businesses, some PSG owned, including Smartfin, Finaid and PSG Anchor Finance. In 2000 PSG 


purchased The Business Bank and used its banking license to create the newly named Capitec from its 


component companies.  


Capitec primarily operates unsecured lending and banking services aimed at low-income markets in South Africa. 


The company has become something of a stock market darling and has a reputation for disruptive practices and 


low operating costs.  


History of microlending in South Africa 
Political developments and legislative changes to lending regulations in the early 1990’s created a surge in 


microcredit availability in South Africa1. Ideally, access to capital and a banking system would revitalise and 


empower the most disenfranchised communities.  


After a rapid growth in microcredit supply, the first signs of individual over-indebtedness led to wavering 


government support for the industry in the early 2000’s. Many of the loans were being used for consumption 


spending, and easier access to capital essentially crowded out already-successful businesses. 


This culminated in the 2002 blow-ups of leading microfinance bank Saambou2 and Absa’s microfinance unit 


Unifer3. 


The industry returned to prominence in 2005 through the establishment of Mzansi accounts: low-cost accounts 


for low-income individuals designed to increase banking reach to lower-income communities. The scheme was 


largely a failure by 2012 with the majority of Mzansi accounts inactive or otherwise dormant leading to little-to-


no fee income4.  


Out of this two microfinance-only names emerged: the now-infamous African Bank Investments5 and Capitec. 


African Bank Investment’s fate was sealed when it was placed into curatorship by the South African Reserve 


Bank (SARB). We believe Capitec will meet the same outcome. 


South Africa is now in the grips of a household debt crisis exacerbated by easy access to microfinance. By 2012 


as little as 6% of the total microcredit volume advanced was being used for conventional business purposes6. At 


one point the mining town of Rustenburg had one microfinance provider per 3000 people with many lenders 


literally operating on the mine site.  


The growing crisis has gained prominence in the South African media with suggestions that microfinance lenders 


had instituted a form of debt slavery for low-income families. A popular TV series, “In Debt” features a “Debt 


Doctor” who attempts to restructure and refinance the show’s contestants7. Several prominent newspapers 


have featured columns on refinancing and administration.

”Carefully concealed high interest rates, hidden administrative fees, unannounced 


penalties for nonrepayment or early redemption, garnishee orders that could tap into a 


client’s income in order to repay a debt, and grossly exorbitant lawyer fees that were 


incurred for any trivial contract infraction”8 


The Board 
Capitec’s board is largely and unsurprisingly made up of several executives from both PSG and Steinhoff. PSG is 


Capitec’s largest shareholder and Steinhoff was, until recently, PSG’s largest shareholder. 


While this is not overly suspicious, we are cautious of incestuous management between these firms given 


Steinhoff’s poor corporate governance.  


▪ Markus Jooste, former Steinhoff CEO, served on the boards of both PSG and Capitec. 


▪ Christo Wiese served on the board of PSG. 


▪ Jannie Mouton, PSG’s founder and chairman, has served on the board of Steinhoff. 


▪ Piet Mouton, Jannie’s son and now CEO of PSG, serves on the board of Capitec. 


▪ Ben la Grange, Steinhoff CFO, has served on the board of PSG – Resigning from Steinhoff African Retail (STAR 


JSE) last week, Jan 25, 2018. 


While large intra-company holdings exist, Viceroy are skeptical of any significant independence within Capitec 


management. To be clear – this report does not have an opinion on PSG’s business model. In fact, the 


unwillingness of PSG to raise fresh equity as an investment group is a breath of fresh air.  


We do have concerns with Capitec’s business, which we will detail in this report, that we believe are not best 


dealt with by a management team that is so intertwined with its largest stakeholder. This presents a very real 


conflict of interest to minority shareholders. 


Breakneck insider sales 
Our sentiments regarding Capitec seem to be echoed by management who appear to be selling shares at an 


alarming pace. Most notable amongst the sales are those of Capitec CEO Gerrie Fourie and former CEO Riaan 


Stassen (2004 – 2013)9.

Jean-Paul Verster and Fairtree Capital  
Ironically, we note that one of Capitec’s independent directors and chairman of its audit committee, Jean Pierre 


Verster, may be too independent to the level of poor corporate governance. Jean Pierre Verster is concurrently 


the portfolio manager of Fairtree Capital and has publicly marketed his big short bet on Steinhoff, which at the 


time indirectly held ~7.5% of Capitec through PSG10.  


 
Figure 1 Extract from moneyweb.co.za article “Jean Pierre Verster: Why I shorted Steinhoff”11 


Legal opinion we have requested suggests that this is a major conflict of interest, regardless of the inherent flaws 


in Steinhoff. 


Fairtree Capital also has extremely small holdings of ~75,000 shares in Capitec through three of its funds: Fairtree 


Equity Prescient Fund, Fairtree Flexible Balanced Prescient Fund and Fairtree Balanced Prescient Fund12. None 


of these funds are managed by Verster which we believe to be a vote of no-confidence in Capitec’s valuation 


and future performance.  


Table current as of January 24, 2018 





Figure 2 Fairtree funds invested in Capitec13,14,15 


Despite limited audit experience, from what we can see from his profile, Jean Pierre Verster appears to be an 


excellent analyst having called the Steinhoff short and prior to that African Bank16. We hope Jean Pierre Verster 


sees the similarities between Capitec and African Bank after reading this report and prudently raises serious 


concerns regarding Capitec’s reporting practices. He has also been positive about our report on Steinhoff and 


we appreciate his comments17.

2 Kicking the can – receivable or not receivable? 
Viceroy believes analysts covering Capitec have placed significant emphasis on valuation of interest income 


streams without back-testing the viability of its loan book. This is an important test given Capitec’s target 


market’s steadily deteriorating ability to service debt per the market analysis in section 6 below.   


Recall that Capitec’s loan portfolio almost entirely consists of unsecured retail consumer loans: inherently risky 


and getting riskier.  


Capitec’s FY 2016 loan maturity profile indicated that ZAR 12.9bn of principal would become payable within 12 


months (i.e. “current”). Capitec’s bad debt (not impairment provisions, but full write-offs) for FY 2017 was over 


ZAR 5.4bn.  


Bad debt impact equates to over 42% of Capitec’s gross collectable principal per the 


loan book’s maturity schedule.  


 
Figure 3 Viceroy analysis of Capitec loan maturity profiles 


We believe this is the tip of the iceberg. As the quality of Capitec’s accounts continues to decline, further 


systemic vulnerabilities become increasingly material and expose Capitec to potential liquidity concerns.

Viceroy Research Group 7 viceroyresearch.org 


Capitec’s loan book income irreconcilable  
Viceroy has back-tested Capitec’s principal loan book balances and have found material discrepancies in working 


capital accounts. A back-testing of Capitec’s loan book movements suggests that ~ZAR 2bn – 3bn is either: 


1. Being repaid early; 


2. Long term loans that are defaulting extremely early; or 


3. Non-cash loans 


Given Capitec’s target market is the low-income demographic, we believe that early repayment of hand-to-


mouth payday loans is unlikely. Capitec’s loan vintage graphs suggest most long-term loans do not default at the 


start of their term. 


Through our analysis below, we demonstrate that Capitec materially misrepresents the balance of its unpaid 


loans by consistently “rescheduling” these loans through the issuance of new loans. 


 
Figure 4 Viceroy analysis of Capitec loan book reconciliation 


Gross expected principal received 
The “current” portion of a loan book (receivable within 12 months) is a reliable indicator of how much principal 


one would expect to receive from its borrowers by the following year, and thus not appear on the loan book the 


following year (we will refer to this as the Gross Expected Principal Received).

Gross intra-year loans 
Capitec have recorded incremental intra-year loans despite management advice that it would shift focus 


towards longer term loans. 


These loans have recently been re-classified by the company as credit facilities – essentially a working capital 


account repayable at the end of each month. The EOY balances for these credit facilities as a percentage of gross 


loans are almost immaterial. We have taken them into account as follows to estimate the principal sums 


returned: 


 
Figure 5 Calculation of intra-year credit 


We must consider the effect of part-principal repayments of loans issued in the current year. We have done so 


on an amortization table for each duration of new loans.  


As interest on loans is typically paid out incrementally (i.e. principal portion of loan repayment increases over 


time), loans of more than 12 months had immaterial effect. 


An example of 2017 calculations: 


 
Figure 6 Intra-year distribution of principal collected 


Intra-year credit facilities and intra-year personal loan recoveries are consolidated into gross intra year loan 


principal received. 


 
Figure 7 Calculation of intra-year loan principal received 


We have assumed maximum interest rates charged on each loan period type, as this is still below a simple 


average of the interest charged on Capitec loan books (prior to intra-year consideration).

Write-offs 
Capitec’s massive write-offs presumably partially contribute to these expected collectable principal figures, 


which slightly complicates the reconciliation of the end-of-year loan book and cash balances as we must now 


recognize an expense amongst asset class transfers. We have therefore adjusted for write-offs on a pro-rata 


basis. We believe this is conservative given loan vintages suggest loans are more likely to default at the end of 


their terms. 


The pro-rata base is the sum of the Gross Loan Book Opening Balance and Gross Intra-Year Principal Received. 


We believe this is a fair estimate without a significantly complex equation and without a more detailed disclosure 


of write-off allocations. 


Bad debt reversals 
Bad debt reversals are not added back on the loan book as they appear to arise from the sale of defaulted loans18. 


A sale of loan book would not result in a receivable loan, but straight cash.

Kicking the can - loans and advances to clients 
Capitec claims to have achieved ZAR 27.2bn and ZAR 24.2bn of loan sales in FY 2017 and FY 2016 respectively19, 


representing over 50% of Capitec’s opening gross loan book each year. Our analysis suggests this figure should 


be ~ZAR 2.5bn – ZAR 3bn lower each year. Another way to represent this is to show the expected vs actual 


working capital adjustment year-on-year based on loans.

Rescheduled loans 
Capitec often reschedules loans which are in arrears. Given these loans are classified as rescheduled, they would 


not (or should not) be classified as “new loans”. Readers should note that the inclusion of these loans in our 


analysis would increase the inconsistency value. 


The Damage 
Viceroy believe between ZAR 2.5bn and ZAR 3bn of Capitec’s loan book balance at the end of FY 2017 was 


payable in 2017, and discretionally carried forward via the issue of new loans to repay delinquent loans. This 


activity would essentially conceal losses the size of Capitec’s earnings and elevate their loan metrics above their 


competitors. 


By refinancing delinquencies, Capitec is also creating a false economy within its income statement, as it records 


interest and fees on delinquent loans which would otherwise be unpaid. 


This type of loan renewal would be concerning at any commercial bank. However, Capitec being a retail 


microfinance lender, carrying forward small, unsecured retail loans represents much higher credit risk. 


The Evidence 
We believe Summit Financial Partners’ case against Capitec corroborates our analysis:

facility.

Figures 14, 15, 16 & 17 Extract from Mthinkhulu v. Capitec Affidavit 


Ms. Mthimkhulu originated two loans with Capitec in October 2014, which she could not afford. This was a 


result of insubstantial affordability assessments by Capitec which did not take into account loan installments! 


Instead of arranging remediation for the loans, Capitec issued Ms. Mthimkhulu more debt to repay her old 


debt, both in December 2014, and again in April 2015. In this period, Ms. Mthimkhulu’s debt spiraled from an 


initial ZAR 35,000 to ~ZAR 100,000.

2013 credit crisis – Capitec history of loan re-financing 
Capitec has a history of loan refinancing indicators, most notably their performance during the 2013/2014 South 


African credit crisis. 


In 2013 as a result of a myriad of factors South Africa experienced something of a credit crunch. The ensuing 


fallout resulted in the eventual collapse of African Bank Investments Limited in 2014 when it was placed under 


curatorship. The comprehensive Myburgh report on the bank’s collapse highlights the differences between 


African Bank and Capitec: 


  
Figures 18 & 19 Extracts from Myburgh report on African Bank Limited21 


Viceroy finds it literally unbelievable that a bank would be able to increase its balance sheet by more than half 


and only incur a 1 percentage point increase in its non-performing loans in that environment, much less an 


unsecured lender.  


Incredibly and suspiciously, 2013 was the first year Capitec introduced its 84-month loans which instantly 


became its most popular loan product, accounting for a third of its loan book. 


 
Figure 20 Extract from Capitec Annual Report 2013 


Given the sudden popularity of the 61-84 month loan product, it would be expected that these loans would 


become a larger part of the Capitec loan book over time. This was not the case.

Figure 21 & 22 Viceroy analysis of 61-84 month loans 


Taken together; the 63% balance sheet growth, sudden and unrepeated prominence of 61-84 month loans and 


disproportionately low increase in non-performing loans leads us to believe that Capitec “rescheduled” non-


performing loans by issuing new loans to delinquent customers in 2013. 


Since 2013, Capitec’s loan book has grown 47.22% yet non-performing loans only increased from 5.8% to 6.3% 


(8.6% increase).  


Viceroy believes that Capitec is artificially maintaining low arrears by issuing new 


extended term loan agreements so clients could pay off existing loans.

3 Capitec credit facility’s origination fee resembles loan shark tactics 
Since 2016, consumer rights advocacy group and financial advisors Summit Financial Partners has taken Capitec 


to court on numerous occasions, some ongoing, on behalf of wronged clients. At the heart of each of Summit’s 


cases against Capitec, is that the bank has engaged in predatory lending practices that amount to reckless 


lending in violation of the National Credit Act. 


Prior to this, Summit Financial were consumer protection advisors to Capitec. Summit states the relationship 


was severed by “irreconcilable differences over Capitec’s lending practices, their failure to accommodate 


consumers thrown into a debt spiral by their products and their refusal to provide documents to enable [Summit] 


to assess their clients’ financial situation”22. 


The major issue Summit appears to have with Capitec was with the operation of its multi-loan facility: 


 
Figure 23 Extract from Summit Financial Partners blog article “Summit takes Capitec multi loans to court”23 


Capitec has subsequently discontinued its “multi-loan” facility, but has introduced its “credit facility” product 


which, for all intents and purposes, is exactly the same thing. The facility: 


1. Offers instantly accessible credit via ATMs 


2. Has a month-to-month payment scheme that resembles payday loans 


3. Is designed as a “unplanned expense” facility, but short terms and frequent full repayments resemble 


payday loans. 


4. Charges a series of massive origination fees and monthly fees – even if you have no balance owing. 


Our analysis suggests that ~87% of the number of loans issued by Capitec (not the value), are through Capitec’s 


recently rebranded multi-loan facility: Capitec Credit Facility. Viceroy believes this facility is little more than a 


loan shark making it ultimately unsustainable and highly unethical. 


Origination fees 
Loan origination fees are a major boost to Capitec’s returns every year and a significant reason Capitec’s returns 


are so exemplary compared to its competitors. While competitors’ origination fees are immaterial (<1% of 


earnings), Capitec’s origination fees contributed ~21% of earnings in 2017.

http://blog.6cents.co.za/summit-takes-capitec-to-court/
Viceroy Research Group 16 viceroyresearch.org 


This is largely attributable to the high number of loans and low value of the average loan issued by Capitec, 


allowing them to charge origination fees more often. 


 
Figure 24 Viceroy analysis of Capitec loan book composition 


While the accounting for these loans is slightly complex (fees are partially recognized upfront, partially amortized 


over life of loan), the relative stability of origination fees year-on-year and moderately flat number of new loans 


issued gives a relatively consistent gross origination fee income. Our analysis of origination fees suggests that 


87% of total loans issued by Capitec are credit facilities.  


Our assumption is also based on a minimum initiation fee, calculated as a pro-rata amount of ZAR 113 (pre-VAT) 


per ZAR 1,000 advance, drawn and repaid every month. 


The reality is that many advances are far below this ZAR 1,000 mark. For instance, we refer back to the affidavit 


of Ms. Mthimkhulu: 


 
Figure 25 Extract of Mthimkhulu v. Capitec 


Therefore, our 87% estimate of credit facility advances as a percentage of overall advances is a conservative 


estimate. 


According to former employees, Capitec also had “a lot of new cash out on extending loans” referring to a policy 


by which the company targets well-performing loans and offers to increase the term (generally into a 36-month 


loan) and increases the cash-out amount. This allows Capitec to book further origination fee income.

Loan sharking 
Capitec’s multi-loan product was withdrawn in November 2015 as a result of new credit regulations which will 


be expanded upon in section 4 below. The multi-loan product is essentially still available, but rebranded as 


Capitec’s new credit facility. 


 
Figure 26 Extract of Capitec’s “Credit Facility” webpage24 


Note that each monthly advance attracts a minimum of 12.9% in origination fees including VAT. Given these 


facilities have the characteristics of payday loans, this fee is essentially incurred monthly.  


Thus over one year drawing down the full ZAR 5,000 facility will incur customers an effective interest rate 155%. 


Viceroy refers to these origination fees as interest because IFRS standards clearly classify these fees as 


interest.  


This origination 155% is paid on top of interest rates of 20.5% resulting in a combined annual interest 175.5% 


assuming customers can meet their payment obligations each month. Considering Capitec’s history of burdening 


delinquent clients with new loans to repay their delinquent loans (see section 4), failure to pay the amount owed 


would substantially increase this interest rate. 


The credit facility also attracts a monthly fee of ZAR 68.4 if in use. If the facility is not drawn down, customers 


are still charged a maintenance fee of ZAR 35 per month, presumably for the “convenience” of having the facility 


available. 








Viceroy believes Capitec’s Credit Facility charges excessive and illegal interest rates, 


disguised as initiation fees and monthly fees.

4 Legal Proceedings 
Viceroy’s investigation unearthed several cases in South Africa’s justice system against Capitec for reckless 


lending claiming the bank: 


1. Failed to conduct affordability and credit assessments and/or 


2. Failed to ascertain whether the customer understood the cost and nature of their loans 


The claims are largely related to Capitec’s now-defunct multi-loan product through which customers could 


access 12 separate monthly loans. Each time the customer accessed one of the multi-loan advances an additional 


initiation fee was charged. We believe that these cases may trigger a class action suit (multi-party litigation) 


against Capitec that would at minimum require a refund of initiation fees associated with the multi-loan product. 


This represents a liability of an estimated ZAR 12.7bn (US $1bn). 


While an initial affordability and credit assessment was conducted at the start of the multi-loan agreement, 


further access to the advances was available at ATMs after answering three questions: 


1. “Your income did not decrease?”; 


2. “Your expenses did not increase?”; 


3. “You are not in arrears at any credit provider?” 


Paradoxically, according to a web archive of Capitec’s multi-loan website, the loans are principally marketed for 


“unplanned expense(s) or emergency situation(s)”. We struggle to understand what “unplanned expense(s) or 


emergency situation(s)” would result in a respondent answer in the positive to the above questions. 


 
Figure 27 Extract of archived Capitec multi-loan webpage dated July 4, 201525 


Considering that each advance incurs an initiation fee this appears to be a credit facility or payday loan rather 


than a loan: thus a full affordability and credit assessment should have been administered for each advance. 


As mentioned in section 2, one customer was issued an R80,000 loan to settle an existing R70,000 loan and was 


also granted an additional multi-loan facility despite the fact the combined payments would leave him with a 


negative balance each month.

Figure 28 Extract of Thobejane v. Capitec 


As highlighted above, this would constitute reckless lending. These claims were echoed by a separate affidavit 


claiming that Capitec advised a customer to take out a ZAR 87,102 loan to cover her outstanding balance on a 


multi-loan facility issued just two months earlier.

Test case – March 2018 
Legal experts that we have spoken to believe the outcome of a test case in March 2018 will be used to trigger a 


class action refund. 


Prior to its prohibition in November 2015, Capitec issued millions of multi-loan advances a year. Capitec continue 


to issue quasi-multi-loans rebranded as credit facilities. We believe that these lending practices were verifiably 


reckless and that Capitec will – at minimum – need to refund initiation fees from its multi-loan product 


amounting to an estimated ZAR 12.7bn (US $1bn). Viceroy have assumed 8% interest on these refunds, which 


is conservative given relatively high ZAR inflation over this period.

Readers should note that the claimants are seeking recovery of all sums paid to Capitec, 


making our estimate fairly conservative.

5 Capitec’s impossibly low arrears 
Critics and supporters of Capitec have both failed thus far to explain why Capitec’s loan performance is 


drastically better than its direct peers. In 2017 Capitec had 6.3% of loans past due (2016: 5.6%); extremely low 


for an unsecured lender to low-income customers. 


As previously discussed Viceroy believes that to prevent accounts from falling into arrears, Capitec simply issues 


a new credit agreement with identical terms. This was corroborated by affidavits of Capitec customers: 


 
Figure 35 Extract of Thobejane v. Capitec 


South Africa has been the graveyard of several unsecured lending operations due to high and unpredictably 


spiking delinquency rates. In this historically extremely risky environment Capitec has managed what we believe 


is an unrealistically low level of arrears with no clear reason why. 


Comparison 
To better assess the likelihood of Capitec’s loan performance being genuine, we have compared Capitec’s 


monthly loan payments to those of Bayport Financial Services South Africa, Standard Bank and African Bank 


Holdings Limited.  


 
Figure 36 Extract from Bayport Financial Services South Africa’s “About Us” webpage27 


Given the overlap between Bayport, African Bank and Capitec’s markets one would assume Bayport and African 


Bank Investments would have similar arrears rates however this is not the case: 


Figure 37 Extract from Bayport Monthly Investor Report November 201728 


Bayport’s arrears rate consistently runs at ~30% of gross advances over 2017.

Figure 38 Vintage analysis from Bayport Investor Report November 201729 


This ~30% arrears rate is echoed with African Bank Holdings portfolio of unsecured personal loans.  


 
Figure 39 Extract from African Bank Annual Report 201730 


Note: Capitec’s credit card product was only introduced in September 2016 and represented 1.3% of its loan book 


in 2017. As such the focus is on the loan arrears rate in the figure above. The figures above are post- African Bank 


Holdings’ restructure, implying an optimized loan book in the target market. 


How is Capitec’s arrears rate more than 20 percentage points lower than companies 


providing essentially the same service to the same market? 


There are really only two possible reasons:  


1. Lower monthly payments making easier for customers to remain non-delinquent; or 


2. Better policies regarding customer approval.

Viceroy Research Group 24 viceroyresearch.org 


Viceroy believes neither of these is the case. For the sake of completeness, we have included our findings below. 


If Capitec were to accurately represent the health of its loan book, it would need to take 


a ~ZAR 11bn write-off and impairment. Together with any potential class action 


liabilities, this is likely to put Capitec on the brink of insolvency. 


Better credit approval policies? No 
As detailed in section 4 above of this report, Capitec’s (possibly intentionally) loose methods of vetting potential 


customers are now the subject of a legal dispute.  


Affidavits claim Capitec did not properly conduct affordability tests for its multi-loan product and in several cases 


issued the client new loans to pay off their existing Capitec loans for which they were in arrears. The customers 


were then issued multi-loan product ignoring the fact that the combined repayments would place them in 


financial distress thus constituting an act of reckless lending. 


Lower monthly payments? No 
Unsecured loans from Capitec garner a headline interest rate of anywhere from 13% to 28%. Due to the large 


number of fees on top of this the effective interest rate is closer to 20% to 40%. These include monthly services 


fees, initiation fees and “compulsory” monthly insurance, the latter of which we were informed is impossible to 


get a loan without.  


For the sake of comparison of monthly payments, we have compared two loans: a ZAR 25,000 12-month loan 


and a ZAR 50,000 24-month loan between three banks: Capitec, Bayport and Standard Bank. The data below is 


valid as of January 27, 2018. 


Capitec  





    
Figure 40 Low- and High-case Payment Calculations for a Capitec Loan31 


As detailed in section 3 above roughly 87% of Capitec’s loan book is comprised of the 12-month credit 


facilities. Accordingly, the cost of these facilities will be of greater importance than the ZAR 50,000 24-month 


loan in our analysis. We have presented the costs of both loans for the sake of thoroughness.

Figure 47 Viceroy analysis of comparative loan repayments 


As can be seen from the table above, Standard Bank beats Capitec on monthly payments for both low- and high-


case scenarios. This confirms our thesis that Capitec’s delinquency rate is irregularly low and cannot be 


accounted for through lower fees than competitors. 


Write-off implication 
Tying our delinquency analysis with Capitec’s loan book irregularities, we believe Capitec’s loan book is subject 


to significant write-offs as delinquencies and risk are massively underrepresented.  


Below is a comparison of Capitec’s loan book against African Bank’s pre-restructure loan book for reference: 


 
Figure 48 Viceroy analysis of Capitec loan book delinquencies 


It’s noteworthy that African Bank has significantly culled its appetite to issue new high-risk loans, and still has a 


significantly higher impairment and write-off rate than Capitec. 


Viceroy estimates that a write-off and impairment of ~ZAR 11bn will accurately 


represent the delinquency and risk in Capitec’s loan book. 


Together with any damages/refunds arising from imminent ligation, this would put Capitec in a net liability 


position, at which point it would be in breach of the minimum liquidity required, as a bank, to meet its 


depositor’s demands. 


Viceroy encourages the South African Reserve Bank and financial regulators to seriously investigate these 


issues and consider placing the bank under curatorship (appoint a Viceroy, as it may).

6 State of the market 


Current financial stability assessment by the central bank 
The recent meteoric growth in microfinancing in South Africa came at a price. Credit default ratios in retail 


sectors have only increased since 2014 especially in the retail revolving credit and “other” categories which 


includes credit cards.  


It is to these sectors that Capitec is the most exposed. The general population’s ability to repay debt has not 


improved:

Viceroy Research Group 28 viceroyresearch.org 


Throughout 2016 to mid-2017 we see a significant decline in disposable income and net wealth, and a flat debt-


service cost as a percentage of disposable income.  


While the National Credit Regulator data shows that the proportion of South Africans with impaired credit 


records is falling, the use of aggregate data is heavily weighted towards the smaller, wealthier demographic who 


are not Capitec’s customer base.  


While the wealthy have had success at meeting this debt, demographic specific indicators suggest low-income 


demographics have seen no improvement in credit crisis.  


Experian’s Consumer Credit Default Index, which tracks demographic credit defaults, shows low-income 


households’ credit defaults remain extremely volatile, even post the 2013 credit crisis recovery: 





 
Figures 51 & 52 Extracts from Experian Consumer Credit Default Index November 201735 


Note: Mosaic type H33 refers to “Senior Single Traditionalists”.  


New defaults were up year-on-year for low-income households, Capitec’s target market 


for unsecured lending. 


Not only is Capitec’s market finding it harder to pay their existing loans on time, but they may not be able or 


willing to incur further loans in the future. Based on household economic indicators and other macro factors, 


Viceroy believes the projected appetite of the market for microfinance is drastically being overestimated. 


Regulatory Environment Changes : Deposit Insurance Scheme 
The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has initiated a privately funded Deposit Insurance Scheme (DIS) which 


will demand contribution from banks. The scheme would aim to protect “less financially sophisticated 


depositors” in the event of a bank failure and operate as a subsidiary of SARB.

http://www.experian.co.za/assets/consumer-information/experian_consumer_default_index_november_2017.pdf
Viceroy Research Group 29 viceroyresearch.org 


SARB suggests a coverage limit of R100,000 per qualifying depositor per bank with a recommended target size 


of 5.0% of covered deposits. This placed Capitec at significant risk with a SBG Securities Analysis note suggesting 


the possibility of a 12% drop in Capitec’s book value. 


 
Figure 53 SBG Securities Analysis – Deposit Insurance Schemes July 24, 2017 


Capitec’s deposits would be largely covered by the DIS placing them at great exposure: 





 
Figures 54 & 55 Extracts from “SARB – Designing a deposit insurance scheme for SA”36 


Viceroy believes the implementation of the DIS will have an adverse effect on Capitec’s ability to lend as it has 


done to date by placing further strain on its cash reserves. Capitec’s 2017 annual report shows ZAR 48,039m of 


retail deposits, implying a DIS funding obligation of ZAR 2,402m.

8 Impossible cost structure 


Staff  
A pillar of Capitec’s growth story is its incredibly low costs relative to other banks and lenders operating within 


the South African market, a factor Viceroy has been unable to account. 


 
Figure 56 Extract from J.P.Morgan Report “South African Banks” dated June 23, 2017 


Despite similar branch and ATM numbers, Capitec boasts a cost-to-income percentage of 35%, far below 


competitors FirstRand(51%), Standard Bank(55%), Barclays Africa(56%) and Nedbank(35%).  


While sell-side analysts and management have been quick to claim this is due to Capitec’s unique operational 


structure, the staff numbers show a different story: 


 
Figure 57 Extract from J.P.Morgan Report “South African Banks” dated June 23, 2017 


Capitec’s average staffing costs per employee are less than half those of any of its 


competitors.  


In 2017, average salaries at Capitec outside of Senior Management level positions averaged ZAR 165k, or USD 


$13k.
Viceroy Research Group 31 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 58 Extract Capitec Annual Report 2017 


Being an almost pure-play retail bank does not appear to be sufficient justification for why Capitec employees 


are remunerated less, the theory being lower qualified positions do not demand higher remuneration.  


Having less staff per branch is also inexplicable, as we are looking at cost on a per head basis. If anything, the 


fewer staff at Capitec branches should be paid more to ensure they get the best people. 


A review of indeed.co.za reflects that Capitec staff members are being paid significantly less than they would in 


the same role at a competitor branch. For instance: here is the average salary of retail branch managers: 


 
Figure 59 indeed.co.za branch manager salaries dated January 28, 2017 


Even African Bank appears to pay branch managers 25% more than Capitec. 


We don’t consider it viable that all local competitors appear to have significantly higher remuneration packages 


for staff than Capitec in similar roles.  


9 Channel checks 


Online reviews 
Consumers’ through to employees’ online reviews commonly refer to Capitec as a loan shark. A telling employee 


review that stood out to us on Glassdoor, states that Capitec actually phones clients to market loans37.

Viceroy Research Group 32 viceroyresearch.org 


 
Figure 60 Glassdoor.com employee review of Capitec 


Consumers appear to feel equally exploited by Capitec, raising issues regarding the non-performance of 


retrenchment insurance, Capitec debiting personal accounts to repay finances and incurring nonsensical fees, 


web checks showing Capitec took monies before they were due, where customers had to endure financial 


hardship as a result. Online reviews point towards a predatory lending operations where the consumer/client is 


locked into a lifetime of debt or use of expensive credit.  


Former employee interviews 
Former employees we interviewed raised serious issues. Viceroy believes these statements speak for themselves 


and require no interpretation: 


“Borrowers “for sure” have 1 or more loan outstanding with other providers Wonga, RealPeople & 


Capfin.”  


“It was crisis management just getting them to pay anything. Capitec had a whole team that would just 


consolidate and defer loans, to avoid default. Not sure what you mean about impairments it was just getting 


them to repay anything. There was no way they’d ever repay some had multi loans with multiple providers.” 


“We would do 27% interest and let the client pay only one monthly fee and one life insurance fee, the 


real interest rate after fees was huge…a substantial portion of the book.” 


“It was like they were paying the call-center people do to the consultants’ work. It was not a secret we 


were a loan shark. It was all about fees, initiation fee, origination fees, non-repayment penalties, outstanding 


loans, consolidation. People could not repay and it felt like you were taking food from their children’s’ mouths.” 


“When the [interest rate] cap came in [Capitec] had a problem. From memory they formed a separate 
insurance company, I think Capitec were the owners. Most of the loans did not have compulsory insurance. It 
was an “automatic” or optional product, but it was clear they wouldn’t get the loan without the insurance.” 
 


“Capitec profited from insurance. There [was] always a delay in processing claims especially for 


retrenchment. The insurance was meant to activate immediately but more often we never got to processing for 


4 months.”
Viceroy Research Group 33 viceroyresearch.org 


“Before leaving there was a big push on lending top up loans to good payers. We’d consolidate the 
balance of a loan into new loan at better rate. The targets were to raise the origination fees in exchange for 
reducing interest rate. Before leaving “no-payers” [defaulting accounts] were increasing.” 


10 Conclusion 
▪ Viceroy’s analysis and consumer affidavits show Capitec is inflating its loan book performance by issuing 


delinquent customers new loans.  


▪ Capitec’s origination fees for its credit facility and former multi-loan facility give it the characteristics of a 


loan shark operation.  


▪ Ongoing legal action against Capitec is likely to result in a class refund of predatory multi-loan lending fees. 


▪ Capitec’s low arrears book cannot be explained any other way: the company must be refinancing its own 


delinquencies. 


▪ Viceroy expects a write-off of ~ZAR 11bn to Capitec’s balance sheet to accurately reflect real delinquencies 


and risk. 


Viceroy believes the outcome of ongoing legal proceedings, massive loan book impairments and income 


statement impact will result in a loss-making, net-liability bank.  


As a result of blatantly predatory lending practices, Capitec massively inflated its loan book which Viceroy 


believes will lead to major write-offs. Despite operating in a notoriously high default and impairment sector of 


microlending, Capitec's default and impairment rates are well below the industry standard.  


Upon accurate accounting of Capitec’s loan book and reserving for potential litigation, Capitec’s own financial 


health seems to teeter on insolvency. The South African Reserve Bank and financial regulators cannot stand by 


silently in the face of these abuses. We implore the appropriate authorities to place Capitec under custodianship 


before further liquidity issues arise. 


African Bank Investments were wiped out in 2012 when strikes in South Africa’s platinum industry prevented its 


customers from repaying their loans. Recent volatility in the mining sector, the introduction of the new mining 


charter and a massive spike in unsecured credit defaults evidenced in the most recent National Credit 


Regulator’s report of 2017 all raise alarms that Capitec is playing a very dangerous game. 


Viceroy believes loopholes are being utilized to sustain unaffordable borrowing. This includes consolidating 


previous loans, restructuring/consolidation fees, initiation fees and service fees which all hide the true reality of 


a business struggling in a sector where historically, businesses have collapsed.  


The National Credit Regulator December 2017 report evidences a defaults and arrears rate topping 100+ days. 


In the unsecured lending sector, there appears to be only one company unaffected: Capitec. This company 


openly admitted to employing inexperienced staff to reduce wages bills, but amazingly has the most success in 


“avoiding” defaults38. 


Capitec will certainly state they have vigorous controls in place to avoid the lessons of other bankrupt 


microlenders in South Africa and Japan. The reality is very different.  


"While unsecured lending bore fantastic results for companies such as Steinhoff and [former] African 


Bank in the short term, it should be plainly apparent that this model is unsustainable and inevitably leads to 


collapse." Glen Jordan - Director, IMB Financial Services39.
