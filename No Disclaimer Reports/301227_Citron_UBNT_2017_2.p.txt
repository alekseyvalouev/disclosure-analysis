Last week Citron Research published a report detailing potential fraud at Ubiquiti
Networks. Since then, we have seen the CEO send off a series of tweets insulting
Citron and mainstream financial media, yet he has not addressed any of the red
flags that surround Ubiquiti’s financials.


Citron exposes Ubiquiti Networks  – Original Report Published 09/18/2017


QUESTIONS FOR
UBIQUITI CEO ON
INVESTOR DAY
For Immediate Release – September 25, 2017


Robert Pera should answer
these ten questions at his
investor day tomorrow:


1. Why have your cash balances held in
the US not grown in proportion to your
sales and expected margins in the US?
[See appendix]


2. Why does your cash balances overseas
generate interest of ~0.2% compared
to 1%+ for peers? [See appendix]

3. Whether it be the low returns on cash
balances or a complicated worldwide
distributor network, the company
seems to have a need for a CFO, do
you plan on hiring an experienced CFO
in the near future?


4. Does Ubiquiti plan on expanding its
board of directors in the future?


5. What does this company look like in 3
years and how do you expect to
maintain industry leading hardware
margins as you move towards more
consumers based products, which
require higher R&D, sales, and
marketing expenses?


6. Why did the company abruptly leave it
San Jose HQ and what happened to
those employees and positions?


7. Accepting that the company has a
misunderstood business model, do
you plan on breaking out products and
segments so the street can have more
clarity into your business and
understand where the margins are
being generated?


8. Why has Ubiquiti had such high
turnover in its audit committee and
financial roles? (6 audit committee
resignations, 3 CFO departures, 1 CAO
departure)


9. Can you update on the performance of
SunMax and AmpliFi (two recent
product launches) and the
expectations for FrontRow?


10. Is all of Ubiquiti’s cash in in Hong Kong
or is it spread among various
countries?

behind Citron’s questions. We detail the
troubling issues with the reconciliation
of cash.


Citron believes that these questions are fair and deserve an answer. It is
unfortunate that the investor day is only open to a select group of people
chosen by Ubiquiti. This story is FAR from over and probably just getting
started. Until these questions are answered sufficiently- the company still
looks like a total FRAUD.
