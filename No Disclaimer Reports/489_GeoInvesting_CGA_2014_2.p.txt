Summary


CGA claims to have invested $113 million to build out a vast network of franchised
retail stores that do not appear to exist.


In its 10-K, CGA claims to have 26,175 branded retailers. We have found little
evidence that they exist.


A December 2013 interview of a CGA employee noted only a few hundred stores
(CGA appears to have taken down the site).


CGA's new website sports a "distribution network" page with links to distributors in
41 cities and provinces, but no valid contacts.


CGA's "special investor days" appear to be a sham as well.


This idea was discussed in more depth with members of my private investing
community, GeoInvesting Micro Insights.


Imagine a world where a small fertilizer company can assign an absurd amount of money
($113 million) toward "marketing-related expenses" to over 1,100 distributors who own or
control over 26,000 claimed retailers - and then give little to no detail about who or where
these distributors and retailers are.


Welcome to the world of China Green Agriculture (NYSE:CGA).


In our initial report on China Green Agriculture, we announced that one year of time-lapse
video surveillance of CGA's high-margin Jinong fertilizer factory showed it had only
shipped out around 1/10th of the tonnage reportedly sold in CGA's SEC filings. Fertilizer
shipments from CGA's Gufeng factory also appeared lower than the tonnage sold per
SEC filings, albeit with data gathered on a much smaller number of days filmed.


We then exposed CGA's bizarre 2014 reclassification of $41 million of property, plant, and
equipment (PP&E) on its 2012 and 2013 balance sheets to marketing-related deferred
assets. As if that wasn't enough, CGA invested another $72 million in marketing-related
deferred assets in fiscal 2014, bringing the combined investment to $113 million. We
questioned whether any of this investment was real, and we suggested it could merely be

a way to move fake cash off of CGA's balance sheet. As of June 30, 2014, CGA had
almost no cash left on its balance sheet (after deducting $25.7 million of customer
deposits).


Today, we challenge CGA's claimed $113 million investment to build a franchise
network of CGA-branded retailers.


On the fiscal Q2 2014 earnings conference call held February 10, 2014, investor Peter
Siris was the first to ask CGA management for an explanation of the approximately $60
million invested (as of December 31, 2013) in marketing-related deferred assets (Note:
this amount does not even include the $41 million of 2012 and 2013 PP&E that CGA later
reclassified as marketing-related deferred assets in its 2014 10-K).


CEO Li Tao responded to Mr. Siris's question by claiming that the investment was to
establish a vast network of CGA-branded retailers "in every village":

Peter Siris: You spend 60 million dollars in building up this franchise network. What
is that for? Opening up stores? Explain to me where that money is, and when we
should see a return from that, because, if you are spending that money, you are
planning to see better business in the future, right?


CFO Ken Ren: Correct, yes.


Peter Siris: Can you give us some guidance on that? When do we see a return to
us?


...


CEO Li Tao: (In Chinese) I think everyone should understand it's marketing. Of
course, our marketing is not putting advertisements on television and such.
It's more about building our exclusive stores in every village, located in front
of the doors of our end users.


CFO Ken Ren: First of all I like to clarify that the 60 million dollar amount is the total
amount we invested to build or to develop the franchising network. Instead of heavily
putting commercials and advertisements on TV networks, over the television
network, what we did, our focus is to penetrate and build a widely accessible
network to cover the remote area including the countryside and rural villages where
the real users and customers can have easier access to our products broadly.


CEO Li Tao: (In Chinese) I hope our end users, who are farmers, will see our
exclusive stores, our signboard, our products when they walk outside their doors.
When they walk back home they will still see our signboard and product. If buying
products, or meeting friends, they will see our signboards and products.


CFO Ken Ren: Our goal, our vision for these franchise networks is to allow, to make
it feasible for our end users, the less sophisticated farmers to be able to see the
brand awareness, to see it... [technical difficulties in the call] Sorry for the technical
glitch. We are back. We are coming back. I'm gonna resume what I just said and
continue. So our vision, our goal from these franchise networking development
campaign is to make it feasible for our very end product users, the farmers, from
rural village in China, and those unsophisticated farmers would be able to see the
image of the company's products, the company's brand, when they out of their
house, when they walk into the road and the street in their town in their village, and
they make it easier for them to carry, to buy, our products easily back from the retail
outlets, from the franchise outlets, back to their home, to use, to consider it, to study

it at their home, and they can make it feasible or easier for them to carry their
products from their house to their farmland. This is the vision of why we are doing
this, and it's the long-term goal, when these franchise networks take effect.


A recording of this portion of the Q2 2014 conference call can be found here.


CGA gives few details about its distributors' retail network in its SEC filings, despite having
surreptitiously invested $113 million in it over the last three years (including the $41 million
of 2012 and 2013 PP&E reclassified in 2014).


According to the fiscal 2014 10-K, CGA launched a CGA-branded retailer program in
2010, and purportedly has 26,175 such small retailers in its network as of June 30, 2014:


Since the launch of the Pilot Program in January 2010, we have worked closely with
our existing distributors who designate over 26,175 retailers, namely the "China
Green Agriculture Retailers" for fiscal year ended June 30, 2014. We have entered
into agreements with these retailers to prominently display "China Green Agriculture
Authorized Retailer" on their exhibits, and have well-positioned standardized shelf
and product displays in their retail stores. In addition, we provide the retailers with
educational materials on proper product use and billboard ads with our product logo
to attract target farmers.


CGA has provided no evidence to support the existence of this vast network of CGA-
branded retailers, leaving investors on their own to determine whether CGA's retailers
exist. Few investors have the capability to perform even basic due diligence into this
matter. Those proficient in Chinese know that simple web searches turn up little evidence
of CGA's 26,175 branded retailers.


$113 million has been spent for this so-called network with little online presence? How is
this even possible? Common sense would tell us that this massive expenditure should
have a much bigger online presence, if only by accident.


CGA's Chinese websites further call into question the size of CGA's network of
branded retailers


On CGA's Techteam website, we found a December 11, 2013 interview of Hongli Qi, a
graphic designer who worked for Jinong, in which she claimed:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2565635-where-are-china-green-agricultures-26175-branded-stores 5/17


"济农现在遍布全国几百家的形象店、直营店的外观设计也是我做的"


"The exterior design of the few hundred Jinong exclusive stores, and direct selling
stores were all designed by me."


In the interview, Ms. Qi uses the phrase "exclusive stores," which is the same term that
CEO Li Tao used when answering Peter Siris's question regarding use of the tens of
millions of marketing investment dollars. Putting signboards on a few hundred stores in
China obviously does not cost a fraction of $113 million.


(Note: CGA appears to have removed the link to the interview of Ms. Qi from its Techteam
website. The cached copy of the interview is still available on Baidu here.)


Furthermore, CGA's newest Chinese website, 900cga.com, has a page titled "Distribution
Network." A screenshot of this web page is shown below. Even non-Chinese readers can
see that the links to maps of the distribution network in 41 Chinese provinces and cities
appear to be empty. When you click on the place links above the map on most pages, a
single blue dot appears centered on most of the maps, with no contact details. Only the
Shaanxi and Beijing maps show any contacts at all; however, none of the contacts are
real.


The Shaanxi map shows 3 blue dots, 2 of which show the same phone number, as shown
below:

The phone number is the same for the second Shaanxi location:

We called this number, and were told by the person who answered that it belonged to the
website development company that built CGA's new website.


The map of Beijing shows a single location with a fake "11111111" phone number with a
Chengdu area code, as well as an obviously fake Beijing address ending in "asdasd":

Here, we are expected to believe that CGA has the expertise and infrastructure to execute
payouts of vast sums of money and coordinate the development of over 26,000
"franchisees," but it cannot simply provide an accurate list of these locations on its
website. Wouldn't CGA have to have a name, address, and phone number, for each
franchisee that it has signed agreements with?

From this, we have reached what we believe to be a fairly obvious conclusion: CGA's
claim to have invested $113 million in marketing-related deferred assets, presumably to
build out a network of 26,175 CGA-branded stores, is doubtful at best and another
example of a pure sham at worst.


We challenge CGA to provide a directory of its branded stores so that investors can
confirm for themselves whether the stores really exist, and then draw their own
conclusions as to whether CGA really invested $113 million into building out its franchise
network.


Once again, we are doubtful CGA will respond, but for some blanket denials and
perfunctory "anti-short seller" language.


To-date, CGA has merely rejected our allegations without presenting any evidence to
disprove our findings. In its press release, CGA bragged about its transparency, but thus
far, it appears to be following the same opaque approach it used when dealing with the
Alfred Little and J Capital allegations in 2010 and 2011. This approach did little to appease
those skeptical of the company, and eventually led to Brean Murray cutting its rating to
"sell," citing CGA's failure to provide evidence refuting the short sellers' reports.


On October 7, 2014, in what seemed like an act of transparency to some, CGA
announced it would hold "special investor days" in Xi'an and Beijing on October 15 and
17, 2014, respectively. CGA asked investors wishing to attend to RSVP the company's
corporate secretary, Ms. Ran Liu, by October 12, 2014. We understand from several
sources that CGA is not replying to investors who have emailed Ms. Liu to confirm their
interest in attending the event. CGA's investor days appear to be open to only close
friends of the management. This is far from adding transparency - the investor days
appear to simply be another sham.
