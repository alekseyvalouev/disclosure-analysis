Report Aug 2015 / Oct 2015 Jan 2019


Enterprise Value $1.7 billion $8.6 billion


Company Promotion / 
Situation Overview


Leading quartz countertop manufacturer capable of producing 
sustainable 43% and 26% gross and EBITDA margins, while producing 


double digit growth in the fast growing U.S. market. The Company 
claimed it needed to increase capex to construct a manufacturing 


facility in the U.S. to accelerate its North American expansion.


Leading telecom and media billing solution provider, able to grow 
organically and support dividend, M&A, and share repurchases from 


existing cash flow. Industry consolidation is a continued source of new 
business opportunities and ways to continue growth and preserve margins


Our Criticism Our intense fundamental and forensic due diligence uncovered 
evidence of slowing U.S. growth, and margin pressure being 
covered-up. We also expressed grave concerns about the 


Company’s strategy to build a U.S. manufacturing facility and 
believed its capex costs seemed overstated, which would allow 


capitalization of costs on the balance sheet and potentially 
overstate earnings. Our background work into CEO Yos Shiran also 
revealed a pattern of mismanagement at Tefron, an Israeli textile 
company, that promoted a unique technology but failed to gain 
acceptance. Tefron’s business and shares ultimately collapsed.


Cryptic entity based in the tax-dodge haven of Guernsey that provides 
revenue management, BPO and IT services primarily to telecoms. Industry 


forces, and dependence on AT&T, have dragged on sales growth to the 
point that Amdocs appears to be in organic decline. We believe that DOX 


has engineered superficial top and bottom-line growth alongside unusually 
stable margins through opaque M&A, aggressive percentage-of-completion 


accounting, software cost capitalization, and repeated one-off net tax 
benefits. Challenged FCF growth, self-imposed minimum cash balances, and 
likely leverage limits will constrain DOX’s ability to pursue growth via M&A 


going forward. 


Successful Outcome Two CEO/CEO’s and two CFO/CFO’s of Caesarstone have 
subsequently resigned. The Company has reported numerous 


manufacturing problems in both its new U.S. production and Israeli 
facilities. Gross margins have contracted to 25%. The share price has


fallen >70% from our initiation price.


Amdocs has been unable to respond to Spruce Point’s criticism, and still is 
not disclosing accounts receivable factoring. Amdocs US president Eric 


Updyke recently resigned, and the Company missed Q1 results and issued 
Q2 guidance that disappointed analyst expectations

Executive Summary

Spruce Point Believes Kornit Digital (Nasdaq: KRNT) 
Is A “Strong Sell” With 75% - 85% Downside Risk


Spruce Point believes Kornit Digital (“the Company” or KRNT) saw 2018 revenues, and particularly cash flow, driven entirely by 
Amazon’s expansion of its Merch program, which are likely to taper based on a slow-down of program growth, and would leave a 
gaping hole in Kornit’s aggressive revenue growth strategy. Forensic evidence from warrants granted to Amazon suggests that 


105% of 2018 operating cash flow came from Amazon gross payments, and a cessation of new orders and rebate incentives coming 
due will depress future results. In addition, we believe Amazon is expanding into Japan, and that Kornit is not well positioned to 


win. Investors’ faith in Kornit’s financial results needs to be evaluated relative to its CFO having been the CFO at MRV 
Communications, which suspended reliance on its financials related to an option-backdating scandal.  With shares up 55% YTD and 
trading near all-time highs at a substantial premium to digital printing peers, Kornit has 75% – 85% downside risk ($4.50 - $9.30/ sh)


Unsustainable Recent Performance Driven By Hyped Amazon Deal:
 Kornit’s revenues to Amazon were 17% in 2018, and grew substantially after Amazon faced environmental permitting delays in 


2017. The sales to Amazon are primarily linked to printers supplied to its Merch by Amazon program, which allows merchants to
design and sell printed shirts and sweaters, while outsourcing production and logistics to Amazon
• Caution: Based on shipping records and weight tonnage, we can estimate unit printer shipments. We believe Kornit has 


discounted list prices to Amazon up to 50%. We also cannot accurately back into Kornit’s 2018 reported revenues, and have 
extreme concerns about the potential for revenue recognition issues


 While the program enjoyed early success, Spruce Point believes US program growth has plateaued, and has hard evidence that 
printer orders delivered to Amazon in the US have dramatically slowed YTD 2019. Furthermore, we believe Kornit will lose 
Amazon’s next leg of expansion of the Merch program to Japan:
• There are numerous alternative competitive print-on-demand solutions to Amazon’s program now on the market
• Amazon has twice changed royalty payouts to merchants, causing a backlash of customer resent
• Google trends for Merch by Amazon show stagnation and recent decline in late 2018
• Amazon stopped disclosing its Merch program and fashion ambitions in its recent annual investor letter
• Extreme Warning: Our industry channel checks and market sources have confirmed that Merch’s program growth is headed 


next to Japan, exactly where Kornit’s fiercest competitors, Brother, Ricoh and Seiko are located, and where Kornit has the 
weakest geographic presence, and just lost its Asia/Pacific President. We believe at best, Kornit’s margins will decline as it 
competes with the inveterate competitors not wanting to lose, and at worst it will lose this expansion opportunity


o We find no evidence that Kornit is hiring labor in Japan, has opened an office in Japan, and has 1 current employee
• Kornit’s printers result in T-shirts that smell like vinegar, which we believe has upset Amazon and its customers. Based on our 


research, we believe Amazon would terminate its partnership if it could find a higher quality printing partner

Spruce Point Believes  Digital
(Nasdaq: KRNT) Is A “Strong Sell”


Kornit’s Issue of Warrants and Rebates To Amazon Are Highly Suspicious:
 Selling digital printers is akin to selling a commodity product in a hyper competitive industry. In order to entice Amazon, 


Kornit issued it cashless warrants (a weak form that requires no capital commitment by Amazon) for its stock, which should 
be viewed as price discounts and are netted against sales.


 Based on the warrant vesting formula, we can determine that total payments by Amazon to Kornit in 2018 were 105% of total 
2018 operating cash flow. This suggests underlying organic cash flow decline from its remaining business.


 In addition to warrants (and price discounts to list price), Amazon also gets price rebates, and Kornit is not adequately 
disclosing the rebate terms in the contract or in the 20-F. This amounts to an effective “triple incentive” to win Amazon
• Based on our research, we believe the rebates will kick-in up to a year afterwards, causing short-term inflation in Kornit’s 


cash flow, and will be a drag on Kornit’s operating cash flow in 2019.
 Kornit uses the non-standard Monte Carlo analysis to value the warrants, instead of the more common Black-Scholes 


method, allowing it wider discretion to value the warrants.  It claims it cannot issue warrant expense guidance. Warrants are
effectively options, and plenty of public companies issue guidance on stock compensation expense.


 Kornit avoided including warrants in its diluted share count calculation, despite the fact 1.1m are vested and exercisable, with
an approximately market value of $16m. Kornit’s diluted EPS is lower than it appears.


 Warning: There’s a discrepancy between reported Amazon revenues in Kornit’s filings. In addition, because it appears Kornit 
received more cash than revenues booked from Amazon, deferred revenues should have increased more than reported.


 Warning: Kornit initially tried to exclude the warrant cost from Non-GAAP EPS, an aggressive tactic that the SEC questioned, 
and made it restate results. In our view, this illustrates how aggressive management is using the warrants.


 Extreme Warning: Kornit’s CFO was the CFO, and named in the option backdating scandal, at MRV Communications (Nasdaq: 
MRVC), which was delisted to the pink sheets, restated financials and settled a shareholder lawsuit. He omits from his bio 
that he started his career at Ernst & Young, which served as MRVC’s auditor and as Kornit’s. We observe that Kornit 
backdated the warrant expense in 2016 – before the Amazon deal was announced in Jan 2017. The backdating amount in 
Q4’16 has represented the single largest charge since inception, which suggest front-loading of expense recognition and 
could allow Kornit to inflate future revenues.

Spruce Point Believes  Digital
(Nasdaq: KRNT) Is A “Strong Sell”


Kornit’s Share Price Offers A Terrible Risk / Reward
 Analysts have bought into Kornit’s long-term growth story, and have meaningfully raised price targets in anticipation that the 


Company will deliver on its promises of sustained 20%+ p.a. sales growth.
 The current average sell-side analyst price target of $28 per share leaves no upside at the current price.
 Kornit’s current valuation is at an all-time high, and significantly above its long-term average. In addition, when viewed in the context 


of its competitors’ multiple and other low-technology computer and printer peers, Kornit’s valuation is at an extreme we’ve never 
seen. Kornit’s average sales, book, and cash flow multiple are 4.4x, 4.0x, 80x vs. current 5.6x, 5.8x, and 182x on our estimates. Digital 
printing peers trade at 1x, 1.4x, and 9x.


 We believe that investors are underestimating the risk that Amazon’s global expansion exclude Kornit, and that recent revenue and 
cash flow contribution taper; analysts also haven’t evaluated the risk or quantified the cash flow contribution in 2018. 


 If Kornit received a multiple closer to printing and computer equipment peers, and our concerns about Amazon come to fruition, it’s 
easy to justify a price target of $4.50 – $9.30 or 75% – 85% downside risk.


Other Concerning Aspects of The Kornit Growth Story
 Kornit’s second biggest customer, Cimpress NV (Nasdaq: CMPR) known for its Vistaprint business, revealed in late Jan 2019 that it is 


under severe pressure, and going through a management shake-up. Kornit conceals the extent of its exposure to Cimpress.
 Kornit’s long-time CEO abruptly and unexpectedly resigned in the middle of 2018, right after shipments were made to TX and PA, 


and ahead of the miraculous recovery in its financial performance and stock price explosion. Before leaving, he received a “special 
bonus” for what amounts to the ordinary role of helping the company raise capital. 


 The new CEO has issued wildly optimistic long-term revenue goals of $500m. Kornit focuses investors to revenue over cash flow, 
which has remained elusive. To illustrate, from 2015-2017 it converted just 1.5% of sales to cash.


 After presenting its long-term vision to investors, Kornit’s earliest and biggest shareholder, sold all of its stock in December 2018. 
The appears to be a vote of no confidence in management’s long-term growth plan


 Kornit is now actively promoting a “game-changing” and “breakthrough” technology for printing on polyester. However, what it 
didn’t actively say, rather burying it in the 20-F, is that its Chief Technology Officer would resign April 2019.


 Kornit is also having to reformulate its go-to-market strategy and acquired its largest distributor, Hirsch Solutions (Feb 2019), which 
accounted for 15% of 2018 sales. From our successful experience identifying short ideas (eg. iRobot, Sabre Corp, Caesarstone), 
distributor acquisitions often foretell signs of strain.

Fact Pattern of Recent Events Cause For 
Investor Skepticism


With KRNT’s share price up 55% YTD and near all-time highs, Spruce Point finds certain events concerning in the overall 
context of management touting record results and ‘game changing’ new product innovations, and promoting an Amazon 
deal where we find concerning revenue recognition and accounting anomalies. Kornit has touted aggressive long-term 


goals with a new CEO in place, inviting multiple broker upgrades, and allowing the Company’s long-time investment 
backer to completely exit its shares. Yet, it buried the fact its CTO would resign in April 2019 after announcing the game-


changing new product introduction. Furthermore, the acquisition of its material distributor at a time when Amazon is 
expanding to Asia/Japan, Kornit’s weakest market, is also a red flag we’ve observed from prior successful short ideas.

It’s All About Revenues


With a new CEO in place, Kornit held an Investor Day in October 2018 to promote its new long-term $500m revenue goal. 
In order to do this, Kornit is promoting its ability to expand its addressable market by lowering CPP or Cost Per Price –


which is the identical strategy presented before that has failed to generate sustainable cash flow. 
No surprise to us, Kornit does not show any cash conversion metrics in its investor presentations. Shortly after this 


Investor Day, Kornit’s earliest and largest shareholder sold all its stock.

Recent share price outperformance and investor optimism is entirely based on its record 2018 results, and investors 
belief in the new CEO’s ability to hit ambitious new long-term goals. Historically, Kornit has had inconsistent financial 


results, and difficulty generating cash flow. From 2015-2017 Kornit reported cumulative revenues of $309m which 
generated just $4.8m of operating cash flow or a lousy 1.5% return on sales.

For quarterly periods in 2017, Kornit did not disclose the amount of warrants granted and vested to Amazon, but recent 
disclosures in 2018 allow us to deduce how much it has received in payments from Amazon. We know that 85,522 warrants 


are granted per $5m of gross payments made upon invoice and order by Amazon. Therefore, we determine that Kornit 
received $35m of payments in FY 2018 which was 105% of its reported operating cash flow of $33.4m. Kornit booked 


$24.2m of Amazon revenues, so why the difference and did the balance increase deferred revenues?

Capital Structure And Valuation


Kornit’s valuation is rich for a commodity-type digital printing company, and analysts are overly optimistic that it can 
sustain 20%+ revenue growth while expanding EBITDA margins from 7.6% to 17.8%. With difficult Amazon revenue 
comps, a new CEO in place, and the resignation of its CTO, we are skeptical that these projections will materialize. 
Our skepticism seems shared with Fortissimo Capital, Kornit’s controlling shareholder and earliest investor, that 


recently sold all its stock in December 2018 at $20.60 per share, or 26% below the current price.

16


Recent Share Price Performance Driven 
Primarily By Amazon


On Jan 11, 2017 Kornit Digital announced a deal with Amazon. Through this agreement, Kornit delivered the Company’s high-
productivity system, the Avalanche 1000, to support Amazon’s expansion of production capacity for the Company’s Merch by 


Amazon service. To entice Amazon, Kornit Digital agreed to grant Amazon warrants to acquire over a five-year period up to 
2,932,176 of Kornit Digital’s common shares at $13.03 per share, based on the volume weighted average closing prices of Kornit 


Digital common shares for the thirty trading days prior to January 10, 2017. (1)

Evidence That Merch by Amazon’s Early 
Growth Has Tempered 


Google Trends for Merch by Amazon is a good proxy for customer interest in the program. The recent data points 
suggest the program has recently plateaued and even experienced a moderate decline. Search interest comes mainly 


from the U.S. where the program was first launched in 2015.

Lower Royalties Being Paid = 
Unhappy Merchants


Amazon has twice implemented royalty cuts to its merchants to support “increases in manufacturing costs”. Royalty 
cuts eat into merchants’ margins, which drives dissatisfaction. There is ample evidence this is occurring. While some 
merchants may be willing to absorb the payout compression, others may seek other platforms, of which there are no 


shortage. A recent article profiled “19 Customer Printing Services As An Alternative To Amazon Merch”. (1)

Amazon Has Stopped Discussing Merch


Amazon discussed its ambitions in fashion and called out Merch by Amazon specifically in its 2017 Annual Report and 
“Letter to Shareholders”. By the following year, Amazon’s discontinued any mention of fashion or its Merch program.

Amazon Now A Material Customer 
Driving Revenues: But Can It Last?


Since the Amazon deal announcement, revenues have grown to $24.2m or 17% of Kornit’s total sales in 2018.

Deep Dive Into Amazon Revenues


Amazon’s revenues have been driven by new printer purchases for new manufacturing facilities; recently, a new facility 
opened in Norristown, PA where Woot! operates an Amazon Merch manufacturing facility. The opening of the facility 


was initially delayed due to “regulatory permitting issues” – according to Kornit – but we know them to be 
environmental issues based on further research. It is currently permitted for up to 48 printers, but by Wall Street’s 


estimate, 40 units have been sold. At the list price of $400K - $500K per printer, the new facility could have accounted 
for upwards of $19m - $25m of 2018 Amazon revenues at 48 units, or $16m - $20m of revenues at 40 units.


Source: PA Environmental Dept


48 machines permitted at 
$400k - $500k per new Avalanche 1000 machine, we 


estimate $19m - $25m of total revenue potential. 
Though based on Wall Street research close to the 
Company, 40 are believed to have been sold and 


installed following environmental delays started in 2017 
that postponed deliveries to 2018 according to local 


media sources.1,2 This would equate to approximately 
$16m - $20m of Amazon sales associated with just the 


Norristown unit sales3,4

2017 Shipments To Amazon


There is only one public record of Kornit making a delivery to Coppell, Texas – a town less than 10 miles away to the Woot! facility in 
2017.  There is also an unusually large shipment of Avalanche 1000 R-Series printers that was made to the New York region on Sept 8, 


2017. At an assumed weight of 2,200 Kg per printer, we estimate the shipment was 38 printers. On Sept 26, 2017 Kornit revised its 
guidance from $34.0m - $38.0m to $27.0m to $28.5m. The article says the customer was “unable to take delivery” due to “delays in the 
receipt of regulatory permits for their site”. But the shipping records show the delivery was made, and by November 16, 2017 in Q4’17 


according to records, Amazon’s Norristown facility was approved. Yet, revenues and inventory barely changed between Q3 and Q4’17, so 
something appears wrong. Furthermore, the implied price of the Avalanche 1000-R units is at a 50% discount to the reported list price.

2018 Shipments To Amazon


Based on public records of imports from Israel to Amazon’s Woot! business entities in the United States, we see that Kornit’s
2018 printer sales to Amazon were driven by orders to its two facilities: Norristown, PA and Carrollton, TX facilities.
Note: We assume deliveries consigned to Kornit North America marked for Houston, TX delivery are also for Woot!.

A Closer Look Into 2018 Amazon Revenues


Using known shipment weights to Amazon’s two facilities, and Kornit’s standard weight measures for its various products, we can 
estimate the total number of units shipped at approximately 9 for Norristown, PA and 20 for Texas in 2018.


We estimate $5.3M - $7.3M of total revenues to Amazon’s US facilities.  Kornit also reported a big increase in European sales in Q2’18, 
believed to be Amazon related, and coinciding with its Aug 2018 expansion announcement to UK/Germany. This resulted in a $5.6M 


revenue increase in the region. This puts our total Amazon printer sale estimate at $10.9M - $12.9M. We estimate Amazon could spend 
between $5.7M – $7.6M on ink globally1, for total Amazon sales of $16.7M - $20.5M. Our total Amazon revenue falls short of Kornit’s 


$24.2M reported Amazon revenues for 2018. Note: Kornit’s CEO resigned June 4, 2018 around the time all of these shipments occurred.

Revenue Recognition Concerns (cont’d)


Per the prior slide, most of the large printer orders were delivered in Q3’2018, which is when we would have expected 
to see a substantial increase in revenues, and a decline of inventory out of the finished goods account. 


Per Kornit’s revenue recognition policy, revenue is recognized with transfer of control and performance obligation is 
completed. We find it curious that revenues grew just $1.7m between Q2 and Q3, while inventory was essentially 


unchanged. Revenues were also flat between Q3 and Q4’18. We could understand some potential time lag between 
shipment, installation and set-up, but multiple months would appear to be excessive.

Discrepancies With Amazon Revenues?


Kornit’s disclosures give an inconsistent view of actual revenues from Amazon. We find stated discrepancies in both 
2016 and 2017 reported revenues. At best just a rounding error, at worst evidence of financial control issues.


Source: Kornit 2018 20-F


2018 net revenues: $142.373M x 17% = $24.2M 2017 net revenues: $114.088M x 13% = $14.84M


Note the % in the past has 
specifically been cited as “net” 


of the warrants which is the 
GAAP amount. There is also a 


discrepancy in 2016 where they 
reported $17.9m vs.$17.4m 


implied from 16%.

Has Kornit Been Treating Amazon With 
Respect And Delivering A Quality Product?


Kornit appears to have a major issue with its products. According to reviews and our industry conversations, its T-
shirts smell like vinegar. This problem seems to have been lingering for many years and remains unresolved based on 
recent complaints. Kornit has even been advertising for a job position in Chemistry Research.(1) Our understanding is 


that Amazon values product quality and customer service above all, and that it has been displeased by Kornit’s inability 
to solve the problem. This issue creates risk that Amazon replaces Kornit in favor of a better quality printing partner.

YTD 2019 Shipments To Amazon


Based on public records of imports from Israel to Amazon’s Woot! business entities in the United States, we see that 
Kornit has made only 1 small delivery classified under printer parts or accessories by HS code. Current purchases 


consist mainly of ink replenishment. It appears demand for new printers has dramatically slowed.

Challenges At Kornit’s Other Largest 
Customer: Cimpress


Kornit conceals the identity of its 2nd biggest customer in its SEC filings, but we have determined it’s Cimpress N.V 
(Nasdaq: CMPR). Cimpress just reported its worst quarter in a long time, with weakness centered at Vistaprint, which 


saw a decrease in new customer bookings. Cimpress is restructuring management, bound to effect Kornit. 


Ronen Samuel Intro Call June 4, 2018: “Good question. Well, 
differences, in the end, the printing, the area that I was dealing with is 
the graphic market, which require very, very high quality but also 
flexibility. Well, with Kornit, we require to print on many different media. 
We need the flexibility. The print quality is different in terms of the 
technology, in terms of the requirement of the end user. I see there on 
the technology side a different, but there's so many similarities. Even the 
customers that I was serving and I give two example that you know 
about Kornit's biggest customer, which is Cimpress and Amazon 
actually were – they are big customers of HP Indigo and I have a 
very close relationship and connection with them. I know what they 
need and there's a lot of similarity between what Kornit needs to deliver 
in the textile market to the graphic arts market”


Customer A Is Amazon
But Why Conceal Customer B?

With Amazon Merch Moving To Japan, 
Kornit Is In Trouble With Big Competition


Spruce Point has learned through investigative research that Amazon by Merch is moving to Japan. This presents a 
major issue for Kornit, because some of its biggest competitors, Brother, Seiko and Ricoh, are located in Japan. 


According to an expert, due to nationalistic pride of wanting to partner with Amazon, we believe there will be fiercer 
competition resulting in: 1) Lower margins to Kornit or, 2) A complete loss of the business to a Japanese firm with 


more local resources.

The principal competition for our digital printing systems 
comes from manufacturers of analog screen printing systems, 
textile printers and ink, such as M&R Printing Equipment, Inc.,

the high throughput digital direct-to-garment market is Aeoon

Kornit Has A Weak Presence In Asia/Japan


We do not believe that Kornit has the same business strength or resources to adequately expand globally to Asia and 
Japan with its material client Amazon. Its Asia/Pacific President recently departed, and the CEO is touting Asia growth 


where his predecessors have failed.1,2 Per its own disclosures, it has the fewest employees in Asia Pacific, relies entirely 
on distributors for initial maintenance and support services, and is experiencing declining revenue in the region.

“As of December 31, 2018, we had 444 employees and 
subcontractors, with 277 located in Israel, 77 in the United 
States, 53 in Europe and 37 in Asia Pacific.”


”In the United States, we provide maintenance and support 
directly to our customers. In the EMEA region, we provide 
maintenance and support to approximately half of our 
customers, depending on their location. In the Asia Pacific 
region, our independent distributors provide initial 
maintenance and support, and we provide second-line 
support when needed.”

Kornit Does Not Show Any Growth 
Needs In Japan


We find no evidence that Kornit is hiring in Japan or has opened a Japanese office. It relies on two distributors in the 
country, and has only one regional manager we could identify, who has been with Kornit just one year. This suggests 


that Kornit is not prepared to grow with Amazon in Japan and may have already lost the business.

Kornit Has Failed In Promising Asia 
Growth To The Market


Kornit has clearly been talking up Asia and Japan for a while, promising that growth would accelerate in the middle of 
2017, according to equity research. Yet, clearly by 2018 results, it showed a decline of Asia revenues, leading us to 
believe that management has been playing lip service to Asia growth, without making the necessary commitment.

of sales in 2016-2018, respectively. The timing of the deal coincides with our discovery that Amazon is 
taking steps to expand in Japan, where Kornit has a weak presence.

Close Look Into Unusual 
Amazon Warrant Transaction
39


A Close Look At The Amazon Warrant Deal


In January 2017, Kornit entered into a master purchase agreement with an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. governing sales of its
systems and ink and other consumables at agreed-upon prices that vary based on sales volumes. It also agreed to provide 


maintenance services and extended warranties to Amazon at agreed prices. The term of the agreement is five years beginning on
May 1, 2016 (note: back-dated prior to signing) and extends automatically for additional 1yr periods unless terminated by Amazon. 


According to the agreement Kornit is required to issue to an affiliate of Amazon warrants to purchase up to 2,932,176 of its 
ordinary shares which vest based on payments made by Amazon in connection with the purchase of goods and services from it.


The agreements with Amazon contain a number of material undertakings and other arrangements:
 Kornit’s revenues are presented net of the relative value of the warrants in each particular period related to the revenues 


recognized. The value of the warrants depends, in part, on the price of its shares and the volatility, and the adverse impact of
the warrants on its net revenues increases as our share price increases. Accordingly, its net revenues may fluctuate due to the 
non-cash impact of the value of the warrant on its gross revenues.


 It agreed to provide a rebate to Amazon based on the number of systems and amount of ink and other consumables Amazon 
orders in a given 12-month period.1 The timing and scale of any such rebate may be difficult to predict and may 
cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual revenues, gross profit and operating profit.  


 It is required to notify Amazon 12 months in advance if it intends to stop supporting one of the products or services that it
supplies to Amazon and to continue to manufacture the product or provide such service during such 12-month period. Subject 
to certain exceptions, it is required to continue to supply ink in such quantities as Amazon requires for at least 36 months after 
the earlier of (1) the end of the term of the master purchase agreement or (2) 18 months following the purchase of the last 
product sold pursuant to the agreement.


 It is required to deliver its products and services to Amazon and to comply with a service level agreement. If it fails to meet the 
requirements under such service level agreement Amazon will receive credits against its cost for those delayed products or 
services.


Source: Kornit 20-F and press release
1) Note: Kornit has twice changed its disclosure about the timing of the rebate. (2017: No mention of 12m period) and (2018: “12 month periods are not concurrent with our reporting periods”) 


Selling digital printers and ink is an intensely competitive business. Spruce Point is concerned that Kornit had to offer both 
price discounts, warrants and rebates to Amazon as part of the deal. Pay close attention to the language where Kornit 
states that the “timing and scale” of rebates may be difficult to predict.  Why should the timing and scale rebates be 


difficult to predict? Wouldn’t Amazon want to apply for its rebate as quickly as possible in the maximum amount available?

Non-Standard Warrant Valuation Method


Spruce Point is concerned that KRNT uses Monte Carlo simulation techniques to value the warrants, when in practice, most 
companies use the Black-Scholes method. We believe this valuation method gives management broader latitude to value the 


warrants vs. the more variable-determinant Black Scholes method. Furthermore, in 2018 KRNT claimed that it could no longer give 
guidance on the impact of warrants to its revenues, despite using the Monte Carlo method, which would allow it to simulate key 
inputs driving the valuation. How does Kornit factor rebates to Amazon into its revenue model? Spruce Point is aware of many 
companies that provide stock option expense guidance while providing forecasts. Why can’t Kornit forecast warrant expense?


Source:  Kornit 20-F, F-29


“Moving to our guidance for the first quarter of 2018. We expect revenues to be in the range of $28 million to $31 
million. We expect non-GAAP adjusted operating income to be in the range of minus 2% of revenues to 3% of 
revenues. These numbers assume no impact of deferred value of issued warrants in the first quarter of 2018. The 
calculation of warrants per value is based on the combined effect of estimation of future revenues from Amazon, 
future Kornit share price in an unknown date, Kornit future stock volatility as well as other variables that currently 
cannot be predicted. Since we are not able to predict these variables, we'll assume the warrants impact at 0 value 
for guidance purposes.”

“As a reminder, the calculation of warrants' fair value is based on combined effect of estimation of future revenues 
from Amazon, future Kornit share price in an unknown date, future stock volatility as well as other variables that 
currently are not predictable and some of which has no correlation to our business. As of today, we are not able to 
predict these variables. We assume the warrants impact at zero value for guidance purposes only.”

Aggressive Warrant Accounting


Clearly the SEC has already taken notice of Kornit’s aggressive warrant practice, and told it to revise Non-GAAP 
results. Kornit tried to get investors to ignore the warrant cost on earnings, despite it being a clear discount incentive 


to entice Amazon purchases. As a result, its Non-GAAP EPS was overstated, and subsequently restatement lower. 
We believe this illustrates that management is willing to be aggressive with its accounting decisions.

Potential Revenue Manipulation Through 
Front-Loading of Expenses?


Why did Kornit recognize warrant expense in Q4 2016 when its deal with Amazon wasn’t signed and the warrants 
legally issued until January 10, 2017?1 It is very concerning to Spruce Point that the largest warrant expense charge 


was recognized during this pre-announcement period. This raises the potential of expense front-loading to potentially 
overstate future revenues.

Rebate Concerns


Publicly, Kornit has promoted the careful language as warrants vesting based on “payments”. Yet, the fine 
print of the Warrant Agreement clarifies “gross payments” by Amazon to Kornit.  


Gross of what – rebates perhaps?

What Kornit Says In the 20-F and Deal Press Release:  “According to the agreement we were required to issue to an

Amazon in connection with the purchase of goods and services from us.”

Rebate Concerns (Cont’d)


Kornit has obscured the rebate terms received from Amazon, and the amount it recognizes in its income 
statement, but says that it accounts for rebates on “historical experience” or “specific terms and conditions 
of the incentive”. We see two problems with this: 1) Kornit has never disclosed offering rebates before in its 
SEC filings, so what “historical” experience does it have? 2) The rebate terms of the Amazon agreement are 
redacted, but based on our interpretation, the “Printer Measurement Period” can extend up to or beyond a 


year as referenced by the term “anniversary”. This suggests Kornit may be delaying significant rebates into 
2019. Maybe now we know why Kornit said the timing and scale were difficult to predict.

“Net cash provided by operating activities was $15.7 million this quarter compared to

activities was $11.9 million in the year ago quarter. Increase in cash was mainly a

$ in millions, except warrants


For quarterly periods in 2017, Kornit did not disclose the amount of warrants granted and vested to Amazon, but recent 
disclosures in 2018 allow us to deduce how much it has received in gross payments from Amazon. We know that 85,522 
warrants are granted per $5m of gross payments made upon invoice and order by Amazon. Therefore, we determine that 


Kornit received $35m of payments in FY 2018 which was 105% of its reported operating cash flow of $33.4m. Kornit booked 
$24.2m of Amazon revenues, so why the difference and did the balance increase deferred revenues?

QoQ Growth -12.7% 19.0% 3.8% -6.5% 85.4%


YoY Growth 1% 237% 105% 1% 114%


If Kornit received $35m from Amazon, but booked $24.2m of revenues, then the $10.8m difference should be reflected in its 
“Deferred Revenue and Advances From Customers”. However, this cannot possibly be the case since the liability account 


balance stood at just $3.63m at year end 2018, while total revenues associated with these liabilities were just $6m. 
Is it possible that massive rebates are accounting for this divergence?(1) Kornit needs to explain this issue to investors.

1) Unless the $10.8m difference was the rebate paid by Kornit. However, to pay a $10.8m rebate on $24.2m of revenues (44%) would seem excessive

Wrong Diluted Share Count?


Despite Kornit stating that 1.1 million warrants are vested and currently exercisable, not a single share is accounted 
for in its 2018 diluted share count. How can this possibly be? Kornit even states that the warrants were not 


considered “anti-dilutive” which would have certainly allowed them to exclude the warrants in the calculation.(1)


?


1) 20-F, F-24: “The total number of shares related to the outstanding options and RSU’s excluded from the calculation of diluted net earnings per share due to their anti-
dilutive effect was 1,498,503 and 884,028 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2018, respectively.”


Factoring in an additional 
1.1m warrants, Diluted EPS 
would have been $0.34 and 
made its Q4’18 and full year 
earnings miss vs. Street 
estimates even worse

Low Quality Earnings: 
One-Time Valuation Release Benefit


Kornit’s 2018 earnings quality was even worse when investors consider that it made the discretionary decision to 
release the full amount of its deferred tax asset valuation allowance of $5.5m. This is a non-cash benefit that Kornit 


will not be able to use as a benefit again in 2019. By normalizing results for this one-time benefit, and factoring in the 
incremental dilution from the Amazon warrants, we estimate 2018 earnings were $0.15c, or 57% below the $0.35c 


reported buy Kornit. GAAP consensus EPS estimate was $0.23c, which Kornit would have missed.

CEO’s Abruptly And Unexpectedly Resigns 
Suspicious In Context 


Investors should be concerned by the unexpected and abrupt resignation of CEO Gabi Seligsohn in June 2018. In our 
opinion, the timing of his departures is suspicious when viewed in context of the anomalous Amazon deliveries in early/mid 


2018, and the subsequent admission by Cimpress NV, Kornit’s second largest customer, that its Vistaprint business is facing 
greater challenges. We also take issue with Kornit granting the CEO a “special bonus” for doing his job of raising capital and 


interfacing with investors. With hindsight, it does not appear he shared Kornit’s long-term vision.

CFO Connection To Option Backdating 
Scandal At MRV Communications


Kornit’s CFO was the CFO and a long-time executive of MRV Communications (Nasdaq: MRVC) which had a large 
financial restatement, delisted its stock the pink sheets, and settled fraud charges related to option backdating. This is 


concerning in the context that Kornit appears to be using aggressive warrant accounting for the Amazon deal, for 
which the agreement appears to be backdated to May 1, 2016 -- months prior to the announcement in Jan 11, 2017. (1,2)

various managerial positions, including Co-President at MRV

Kornit’s CFO omits from his biography that he learned his accounting at Ernst & Young. We verified this by 
checking his biography disclosed while he was the CFO at MRV Communications. It is very concerning that 
Kornit’s current auditor is a member of E&Y Global, and has challenges with spotting accounting failures. 


Mr. Avidan served as MRV’s acting Chief Financial Officer in July 
2007, a position that became permanent as of January 2008. Prior to 
assuming the Chief Financial Officer position, Mr. Avidan served as 
Vice President and General Manager of MRV’s subsidiary, MRV 
International, from 2001 to July 2007. From 1995 to 2001, he served 
MRV in various executive capacities with other MRV subsidiaries. 
From 1992 to 1995, Mr. Avidan served as Vice President of Finance 
and Chief Financial Officer of Ace North Hills, which MRV acquired in 
1995. From 1989 to 1992, he practiced accounting with a public 
accounting firm that became part of Ernst & Young. Mr. Avidan 
holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics and Accounting 
from Haifa University.

Tefron was another US-listed, Israeli founded company promoting 
its game changing technology in the textile industry that eventually 
collapsed. Like, Kornit, it heavily promoted a partnership with a 
major US company (Nike). The stock ultimately collapsed, 
allegations of bad faith were raised by insiders, and accounting 
restatements occurred. For more, read our prior report.

Spruce Point is concerned that the CTO’s resignation was not more broadly disclosed, particularly in the

Extreme Valuation Disconnect


Kornit trades at a meaningful premium to direct digital printing peers it competes with, as well as its second 
largest print customer which is struggling, on the belief that its 20%+ revenue growth rate is sustainable and 
its margins are better than peers and will expand. We believe Kornit is set-up to miss these revenue growth 


expectations when it becomes apparent that the Amazon’s growth contribution cannot be sustained, and 
issues with Cimpress’ struggles flow through to Kornit.

Kornit has a very poor history of generating cash 
flow from sales. We believe 2018 operating cash 
flow is an extreme anomaly driven by $35m of 


gross Amazon payments that won’t reoccur, and 
rebates that will further depress results. We apply 


peer cash flow multiples to our generous and 
optimistic cash flow forecast for 2019  


$ in millions, except per share amounts


Given our concerns about the reliability of Kornit’s financials, we believe the most conservative way to value the Company 
is on its revenues and cash flow, both of which we believe will normalize for the large Amazon contribution in 2018. 


In addition, we believe the Company’s multiple will be re-priced as it realizes that Kornit’s 20%+ revenue growth has never 
resulted in material cash generation for investors.
