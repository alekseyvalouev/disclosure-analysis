Until Q4 Call, When Management Said…


“We are focused on, and making significant 


progress in, resolving numerous claims and 


unapproved change orders as well as billing and 


collecting other unbilled amounts, which will allow 


us to convert these unbilled costs to cash.”


- Gary Smalley, CFO Q4 2015 earnings call

Are AR the Next Unbilled 


Receivable Problem?


“[TPC is] focusing heavily on collecting

Are AR the Next Unbilled 


Receivable Problem?


“I don't think we're expecting working capital to continue to 


grow. As we said, this quarter, we held unapproved 


changeovers and claims pretty flat over the year. And the 


increases that we've got in unbilled and in receivables are 


purely timing differences as that volume of work starts to 


pick up.”

Banks However…


Will Bank of America say “enough is enough”?


• TPC is subject to recent additional covenants regarding its liquidity, including weekly 


minimum liquidity requirements (based on specified available cash balances and 


availability under the Revolver)


• Loan agreement has been amended 6 times in 5 years, ranging from readjusting the 


leverage covenant higher, due to lower than expected EBITDA to higher fees and 


moving the maturity ahead of the bonds and lowering additional borrowing capacity.   


• We believe these kinds of changes are typical of a credit facility with distressed or 


CCC rated credits. 


• The leverage covenant is currently calculated at 3.6x vs. the covenant stepping down 


to 3.25x by 4Q.

Liquidity Could be a Major Problem


• As of Q2, the company had $93.6 million of cash on the balance sheet.  


However, 79% of that cash is in JVs with access restrictions. TPC runs its 


unpredictable, negative free cash flow business (ex-JVs) on $19 million of 


cash on hand.


• With only $19 million of accessible cash on hand and $145.8 million of 


unused revolver capacity and relatively volatile cash flow, the looming $600 


million in maturities due in 2018 (includes full draw on revolver) could be an 


issue. 


• Access to the revolver could be an issue after Bank of America’s numerous 


amendments and restrictions on the facility.

Even So He Had to Sell His Stock, 


Which He Hated


“I hated every sale of stock I've made, since my first one. I 


have one more that I have to make over the next 30 days 


to satisfy a final agreement. After that, I don't intend to sell 


any stock at these ridiculous numbers. It's like cutting off 


fingers every time I sell at these prices.”

Tutor Share Transactions


• To be fair, he made open market purchases in 


2015 of 200,000 shares in 2015 (approx. $4.5 


million)


– almost covered by his $3.75 million bonus for 


(not yet) finding a successor


• He has net sold estimated 13 million shares 


since 2009.
