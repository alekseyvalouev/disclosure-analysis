Summary


Short Ideas Healthcare


The U.S. Preventative Services Task Force’s Colorectal Cancer Screening Draft Recommendation issued
yesterday is devastating for Exact Sciences' only product, Cologuard.


I think this is the beginning of the end for the company.


My price target for the stock a year from now is $3, so I shorted more yesterday.


The shares of one of my largest short positions (~3%), Exact Sciences, crashed by more than 46% yesterday to close
at $9.98 after the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force's Colorectal Cancer Screening Draft Recommendation listed
Exact's sole product, Cologuard, a poop-in-a-bucket screening test, as an "Alternative Test" rather than a
recommended one, and said numerous damning things such as:


The USPSTF found no studies that assessed the impact of screening with FIT-DNA [Cologuard] on cancer
incidence, morbidity, quality of life, or mortality.

Evidence on the optimal screening interval, if any, is lacking.


A theoretical concern about FIT-DNA is whether its use might lead to more frequent and invasive followup testing
in persons who are not at increased risk of colorectal cancer because of patient or clinician concerns about
abnormal DNA results.


There are no data that evaluate how to implement FIT-DNA into a longitudinal colorectal cancer screening
program.


…empiric evidence is lacking on appropriate followup of abnormal results, making it difficult to accurately bound
the potential net benefit of this screening test.


I haven't written about Exact Sciences prior to now because it isn't a fraud/scam or doing nefarious things like so many
of the stocks I've written about on Seeking Alpha (see Chris DeMuth's summary of my calls on WRLD, LRN, LL, IOC,
DDD and UNIS). Exact has a real product that addresses a very serious problem, the low screening rate for colorectal
cancer, the second-leading U.S. cancer killer. Nevertheless, I felt (and still feel) that it's a great short because the test
has significant drawbacks that will severely limit its adoption and, in light of this, the valuation is absurd.


While I've never published an article about it before now, I did pitch this stock as my favorite short at the Robin Hood
Investors Conference a year ago when it was at $24.22 (click here to see my slide presentation). In light of the 59%
drop in the stock since then, it might appear to have been an easy short, but it was anything but. I first shorted it at
$14.22 in April 2014 and watched it soar over the subsequent 15 months to a peak in late June of $32.85. This was
extremely painful, but I was confident in my analysis and didn't cover a single share - in fact, I added to the position on
a number of occasions, most recently just a couple of weeks ago at $19.57 - so it's nice to see my analysis (and
stubbornness) pay off.

Now I have a high-class problem: what to do when an investment works? While it can be dangerous adding to a short
position that's already fallen a lot, it can also be highly profitable if the stock continues to plunge, as my experience
with Lumber Liquidators demonstrates.


The only rational way to think about this is to pretend like I never had a position and was looking at this stock for the
first time today. In the case of Exact Sciences, I fail to see how a "single product" diagnostic company, whose test just
got body slammed by a highly influential group, could be worth anything close to its current market cap of nearly $1
billion.


I expect that the USPSTF report, which could hardly have been more damning, will cause what little demand there is
for the test to plunge (what physician is going to prescribe an "Alternative Test" when far cheaper, established
"Recommended Screening Tests" are available?) and many good salespeople to flee (one friend, who knows many
Exact salespeople, tells me that the sales force is in a state of chaos, hardly surprising since most of their options are
now underwater). As a result, I think the company is likely to miss analysts' revenue estimates by a country mile.
Specifically, Canaccord and Wedbush, in their latest reports, predict 2016 revenues of $112 million and $113 million,
respectively, which I think is laughable.


In Q2, Exact's revenues were $8.1 million, which analysts expect rose to $12.6 million in the just-ended Q3. I have no
view on whether Exact will meet this number when it reports earnings at the end of this month, but I have a strong
opinion that the company has almost no chance of meeting analysts' consensus going forward revenue estimates of
$18.2 million in Q4 and $139.8 million next year. In fact, I think Q3 may well prove to be the peak and that the
company's revenues will be well less than half what analysts are currently forecasting.


Enormous Cash Burn


If I'm right about a massive revenue miss, this, by itself, will crush the stock - but in addition, I think it will be difficult for
Exact to reduce the enormous cost structure it's built up in anticipation of Cologuard's launch. As this chart shows, the
company has been burning an average of $37 million over each of the last three quarters:
