CITRON REPORTS ON
LONGTOP FINANCIAL
(NYSE:LFT)


“Money made through dishonest practices will not
last long”…Chinese Proverb


  Introduction


To think the fraud in the US listed Chinese stocks is limited to the


RTO market is naïve.  Citron introduces a story that has all the


markings of a complete stock fraud — with off balance sheet


transactions that create outsized margins and management with


backgrounds unsuitable to run a public company.


The most obvious risk factor in the China space, and the factor that


has linked so many of these collapsed stocks, is obviously “the story


too good to be true”.    Which brings us to the curious case of


Longtop Financial (NYSE:LFT), a company that produces software


for the banking sector.   In this report, Citron outlines several


concerns which should be considered by the auditors as they


prepare the company’s annual audit.  It is the opinion of Citron that


every financial statement from its IPO to this date is fraudulent …


read on to understand.


   Margins far in excess of
competitors

LFT reports spectacularly high margins — much greater than any


peer company.  In the fiscal year March 2010 LFT reported gross


margins of 69% and non-GAAP operating margins of 49%. Peers


report gross margins between 15-50% and operating margins of 10-


25% or even lower.


Management's explanation for the high margins is that they have


more standardized software sales then peers and standardized


software has very high gross margins of around 90%. The company

5/26/2018 Citron reports on Longtop Financial (NYSE:LFT) – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-longtop-financial-nyselft/ 3/10


claims that these solutions and modules can be deployed to new


customers with fewer  man-hours and expenses.


Furthermore, even if you believe the standardized software gross


margin is 90%, then this implies that LFT is generating 60-65%


gross margins on customized software development which is still


much higher than peers.   If the China space has taught us anything,


it is that when something seems too good to be true, it probably is. 


So what is the real reason for these supersized margins?


  1.  Unconventional Staffing Model


Until recently, the vast majority of LFT's employees were not


directly employed by the company. As of March 31, 2010 LFT had


4,258 employees of which 3,413 (80%) were employed by third-


party HR staffing companies.


Of the employees at staffing companies, 95% (3,235) were from a


single firm called Xiamen Longtop Human Resources Services Co


(XLHRS), but this entity has no verifiable business presence except


for LFT.  (The remaining 5% were being serviced by Beijing FESCO


and Randstad Shanghai Temp Staffing, both of which do have a


verifiable business presence beyond LFT). 


LFT has consistently claimed that (XLHRS) is an unrelated party. 


The existence of Longtop Staffing has allowed LFT to transfer the


majority of its cost structure off-balance sheet which creates


opportunities for massive accounting fraud.  Does any of this sound


unrelated to you?


Xiamen Longtop Human Resources (XLHRS) shares a name


with its only customer:  Longtop Financial.


XLHRS was formed in May of 2007, just months before LFT’s


IPO


Even though it is its largest line item expenditure by far,


XLHRS is never mentioned in filings until the annual report


filed July 2008.


XLHRS has no website and does not seem to be soliciting any


customers, even though they just lost their only customer


LFT did not have any long term contract and did not have to


pay any penalties or minimums in their relationship with


XLHRS

XLHRS used the same email server as their only client — as


evidenced by these help wanted ads placed by them that ask


perspective employees to contact them at “longtop.com.  For


example, this is a 2009 job listing listing for XLHRS using a


Longtop.com email address:


http://www.xmjob.com.cn/web/temp/sh
ID=101114
[http://www.xmjob.com.cn/web/temp/s
ID=101114]    
As of writing of this report, Citron has reason to believe that


XLHRS has for months been located in the same building as


Longtop Financial. 


When the outsourcing agency relationship was challenged, the


company’s response was to terminate it, and take all the


employees in-house.


Same building, same email, same name, no
other customers … but a totally unrelated
party? 


If in fact XLHRS is discovered to be anything other
than a completely independent company, then every
financial statement from inception to the present will
have to be restated, and Longtop will go down in
history as “another China fraud stock”.


Previously, the company claimed this outsourcing
arrangement was part of the justification of its
outsized margins.  Yet now that they are dumping
XLHRS, the company says there will be no financial
penalty, no cost and no margin loss associated with
“taking a Mulligan” on the whole relationship!  Great
trick!


“Extreme outsourcing” is a common characteristic
of other stocks in the China space that have collapsed
under findings of fraud.  Why?  Because it obliterates
transparency.  For example:  the large advertising
sales teams responsible for CCME’s huge reported
income couldn’t be located – the company claimed
they were outsourced.  Similarly, DGW and DYP
claimed outsourced distributor networks; reality was
another matter.

We understand that Citron is making a bold claim in
saying that Longtop is committing fraud by setting up
their own HR Company to lay off certain liabilities. 
What the outsource maneuver does is make invisible a
lot of metrics that would afford meaningful insight
into how the company operates, such as ratios of
revenues per employee, costs per employee, etc.


Even though all the indicators and evidence would
suggest XLHRS is a subsidiary of LFT, and not an
unrelated party, would management be that
brave to set up a company with the same name
in order to deceive?


YES!!  THEY HAVE DONE IT BEFORE — AND
HAVE BEEN FOUND LIABLE, TOO.


  2.  Key Management Background
Misdeeds


– “Study the past if you would define the
future.”  Confucius


Before they founded Longtop, Chairman and CEO Jia and Lian


worked for a company named Xiamen Dongnan Computer Co.  They


conveniently left this out of their bios in the prospectus. 


http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1412494/00
[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1412494/0


Mr. Xiaogong Jia is one of our founders and
has served as the chairman of our board of
directors since our inception in June 1996.
Mr. Jia has over 29 years of experience in
China’s IT industry. He is currently a standing
director of the China Business Council,
director of Fujian Computer Society, vice-
president of Xiamen Computer Society and
standing vice chairman of Xiamen Software
Industry Society. Prior to founding our
company in 1996, Mr. Jia has served various
positions including deputy head engineer, vice
general manager and general manager of
Xiamen Longtop Electronic Computer
Company.


Mr. Weizhou Lian is one of our founders
and has served as our director and chief
executive officer since our inception in June

1996. He has over 20 years of experience in
China’s IT industry. Prior to founding our
company, Mr. Lian held various positions,
including technology department manager,
sales department manager, vice general
manager and general manager, of Xiamen
Longtop Electronic Computer Company from
1985 to 1996.


 


A reason for this omission could be that they were
sued by their former employer for unfair business
practices. 


Translated Case: Xiamen Dongnan vs Jia
Xiaogong and Lian Weizhou
[https://docs.google.com/viewer?
a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B1c7XC1mx
XnoEK]


In the lawsuit, they were found liable for drawing
salaries from their old employer while working for
their own company. 


Leading up to mid-1996, Jia Xiaogong (LFT Chairman,
aka Ka Hiu Kung) and Lian Weizhou (LFT CEO, aka
Lin Wai Chau) were working as managers at Xiamen
Dongnan Computer Co (XDCC) and its parent
company.


On July 15, 1996, unbeknownst to their employer, Jia
Xiaogong, Lian Weizhou, and two others set up a
company called Xiamen Dongnan Rongtong
Electronic Co (XDREC), and allegedly  recruited 43
of their co-employees.


The suit also alleged that on October 15, Lian signed a
contract with one of XDCC's major clients, but
inscribed on the contract that he was working for
XDREC instead of XDCC. The two company names
sound very similar in both Chinese and English so it
would be likely that the client thought he was signing a
contract with XDCC.  (The good ole’ same name
confusion trick!)


And this is what we found most amazing:


Then, on November 26 Xiaogong and Weizhou
allegedly sent a letter to the Xiamen Postal Office

stating, “due to our business needs, our address has
changed from 5th floor, Huli Information Building to
11th floor, Huanjian Building, Xinzhong Road,
Xiamen; please forward all relevant mails to the new
address".  The new address was a PO Box they set up
to illegally intercepting the mail of their namesake
company.

It should be noted that this was no ordinary case.  It
went to the high court in Fujian.   Talk about a
“textbook case” – this case has literally become
one!  Here it is referenced as one of the cases in the
book entitled:


"Anti Unfair Competition Law: Principal Cases
[http://books.google.com/books?id=F82-
uCFPGXIC&pg=PA15&lpg=PA15&dq=%E5%8E%A6%E
"


So we are supposed to believe the management
would never pull the same name trick…..even
though they have done it in the past.  Do You
Really Believe This??


At the very least, had this track record of management
been properly disclosed in the prospectus, investors
would have had the option of considering it before
deciding to plunge hundreds of millions of US
investment dollars into this company.  This was, after
all, the foundation of the current Longtop.  Would the
IPO have actually closed?


  3.  Non-transparent Management
Transactions


In a day in age where Warren Buffet and Bill Gates are
pleading with billionaires to give half of their fortune
away to charity, Longtop Founder and Chairman Hiu
Kung Ka has gifted 70% of his stock holdings to his
own employees and friends in the first 4 years of the
company being public.  This transaction is not just
fishy…..it stinks.

http://citronresearch.com/citron-reports-on-longtop-financial-nyselft/ 8/10


We challenge anyone, including the analysts, to find
any CEO or Chairman of a publicly traded company on
any exchange in the world, who has “gifted” this
amount of stock to his own employees. 


Does the guy — who set up a dummy P.O. Box to divert
his employer’s mail and steal its customers –seem like
the kind of guy who would just give away his net worth
with no encumbrances?  We know that Hiu Kung Ka is
a shrewd businessman who doesn’t mind playing loose
with the rules.  And we are supposed to believe that he
has just “gifted” 9 million shares, valued at over a
quarter billion dollars?


It is the opinion of Citron that this transaction has an
undisclosed “tail”.  Was money used to either pay off
hidden liabilities of the company?  Or does it generate
an undisclosed benefit to Mr. Ka?   Either way, this
type of transaction undermines the credibility of
management, which, in the absence of full
transparency, must extend to revenue recognition,
acquisitions, and staffing cost issues, LFT’s largest
expense.


 4.  Audit is coming – will it be a
day of reckoning?
LFT is audited by Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the
mainland China arm of Deloitte & Touche.  Prior to
this year, investors would have regarded Deloitte as
“the gold standard” for accounting in China. 


However, in the wake of the CCME debacle, in which
Deloitte’s recent resignation letter identified no less
than ten separate instances of the most egregious
corporate malfeasance, Citron has to wonder how it
was that Deloitte was all too happy to sign off on
CCME’s books in 2009.


Obviously the halo over Deloitte’s head has been
broken.  There are a lot of bridges to be crossed before
Longtop’s current-year audit can be put to bed.


A Note to Analysts


Last week the analysts were quick to defend the
company –against accusations that were never
made.    Instead of just dismissing any bear case …

Citron says do what you are paid to do … start
ANALYZING.  The last thing Wall St. needs is more
discounted cash flow analysis based on asking for
management’s forecasts. 


Citron challenges you to answer these concerns
without starting with the phrase “after
discussions with management”.  Do LFT’s
margins truly pass the smell test in cost-competitive
China?  Does the staffing story make perfect sense to
you?  How about management’s stock gifts? 


If not, what are the risks of “massaged” revenue
recognition, and/or the ugly implications of related
party impacts on acquisitions, cost accounting, and
stock transactions?


Other Issues


As telegraphed by the analysts and management, there
are concerns about the revenue recognition from some
of LFT’s larger customers.  We will save all
information on the revenues for Part 2 of our
reporting on Longtop.  The other issues that will be
addressed in future reports are beneficial ownership of
its acquisitions and the nonsensical answers the
company has given for its unusual staffing model,
which leaves critical investors thinking they are just
“making it up as they go along”.
