The Bell Tolls For Deer Consumer Products

On 10/9/12, Deer Consumer Products (DEER - Halted since 8/13/12) filed an 8-K (here)
disclosing that on 10/2/12 NASDAQ made a strongly worded determination to delist DEER
for the following reasons:


1. DEER made "false and misleading disclosures regarding the operational status of its
manufacturing facilities in Yangjiang, China";


2. DEER failed "to provide complete responses to NASDAQ Staff's questions regarding
the Company's customers, suppliers and shipping providers"; and


3. DEER's "involvement in a scheme to illicitly transfer corporate funds to a group of
stockbrokers through a bogus consulting contract."


Regarding the first reason, NASDAQ's assertion that DEER lied about the operational
status of its Yangjiang manufacturing facilities affirms my findings in a Seeking Alpha
Editor's Pick article I published (here) on 8/14/12 which concluded that DEER's old factory
was completely idle and its new factory was operating at less than 5% of capacity.


Regarding the second reason, I believe NASDAQ's questions concerning DEER's
customers relate to previous allegations that DEER exaggerated its sales. I recently
engaged a team of market researchers to conduct random channel checks of the retail
sales of DEER's largest reported customer, Gome Electrical Appliances Holdings Limited.
Based on the results of these visits to Gome flagship and other major market stores I
concluded that DEER's sales to Gome are substantially lower than reported in its SEC
filings. The following is a summary of the findings:


1. All 24 Gome stores interviewed reported declining sales, averaging well under 10 units
per week.


2. 6 Gome stores reported a lack of product supply from DEER, which is consistent with
my findings that DEER's factories are idled.


3. 14 stores attributed the weak sales to a lack of brand recognition.
4. 8 stores felt DEER does not care about its business with Gome and provides no retail


support.
5. 5 stores complained that DEER refused to pay sales commissions as promised.

Regarding NASDAQ's third reason for the delisting, financial investigative journalist Roddy
Boyd first broke the story in December of 2011 (here) of DEER's illicit transfer of corporate
funds to pump its stock in 2010 and Bill Singer of Forbes in February of 2012 reported on
FINRA's settlement of the matter (here). DEER's stock price history shows that buyers
tried very hard to keep the stock above $11 for four months prior and one week after my
original report in March of 2011.


Another clue is that NASDAQ's delisting decision came one day after DEER's Audit
Committee Chairman submitted his resignation (see 8-K here). Despite DEER's claim that
the resignation was not due to any dispute with the company, the timing certainly raises
suspicions.


I conclude that NASDAQ was not a moment too soon to delist DEER, putting an end to
DEER's long history of false and misleading disclosures to its investors that I first exposed
over one and a half years ago. I am preparing to file a whistleblower report to the SEC
showing how DEER's management, directors, promoters, auditor, and lawyers should all
be held accountable for investor losses.


Many investors rightfully question why it took regulators so long to take action against
DEER. I believe there are several reasons. First of all, DEER categorically denied my
allegations and commenced a costly and aggressive legal campaign to silence my
opinion. DEER then engaged its Wall Street analysts to visit and defend the company.
None of this worked as DEER's stock price sunk lower and lower, after DEER failed to
refute each new allegation.


DEER received a major boost from Silvercorp Metals (NYSE:SVM) CEO Rui Feng's fight
against a "conspiracy" of short sellers. On 9/19/11 SVM announced (here) that, "We look
forward to co-operating with Deer and all other victims of Alfred Little." The next day The
Globe and Mail reported (here) that SVM was "teaming" with DEER to fight short sellers
and quoted Rui Feng stating: "Our lawyers are now working with Deer's lawyers to launch
a lawsuit together to subpoena these people behind the scenes." [Emphasis added]


Who are the so-called "victims" of "conspiring" short sellers that DEER and SVM teamed
against and swore to avenge? In light of NASDAQ's decision to delist DEER for lying
about the operational status of its factories, failing to provide complete responses about its
customers, and illicitly transferring corporate funds to a group of stockbrokers, the only
true victims are the investors victimized by companies such as DEER. The only real
conspiracy was conducted by DEER and SVM to silence their critics; critics who once
again have proven to be correct.
