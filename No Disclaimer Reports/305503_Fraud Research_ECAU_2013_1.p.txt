Echo	Automotive:	The	$155	Million	Company	Driven	By	Promotional
Steam
Feb.	7,	2013	8:45	AM	ET46	comments
by:	Fraud	Research	Institute


On	January	28,	2013,	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	published	its	first	research	report	on	a
penny	stock	in	the	graphite	sector	that	was	subject	to	a	massive	stock	promotion
campaign.	This	promoted	penny	stock	was	the	perfect	subject	for	our	first	investigation:
zero	revenues,	$2,212	total	assets	and	a	very	questionable	stock	promotion	that	included
the	dissemination	of	unsolicited	commercial	emails	(SPAM)	are	all	perfect	ingredients	for
an	inevitable	collapse	of	a	pre-revenue	mining	company	valued	at	more	than
$100,000,000.


Since	the	publication	of	our	research	report	titled	USA	Graphite:	Why	This	$100	Million
Company	Could	Fall	By	85%	Or	More,	the	stock	has	dropped	by	79%	in	a	mere	8	trading
days.


Our	current	investigation	began	when	we	noticed	an	increase	in	the	trading	volume	of	a
development	stage	company	led	by	a	president	with	a	checkered	career	as	an	executive
in	the	automotive	industry.	More	specifically,	he	was	very	closely	involved	with	a	number
of	automotive	companies	that	eventually	went	bankrupt.	Now	this	individual	is	leading	a
technology-oriented	automotive	company	and	he	has	brought	aboard	several	other
executives	who	have	been	involved	in	their	own	failing	automotive	ventures.


After	the	discovery	of	a	stock	promotion	campaign	with	an	astonishing	$3,000,000	budget
that	has	greatly	contributed	to	this	stock's	recent	explosion	from	$0.75	to	$3.61,	we	are
very	certain	that	this	current	investigation	will	be	an	equally	successful	win	for	both
experienced	traders	that	take	the	trade	and	also	for	traders	just	starting	to	get	their	feet
wet	in	the	market	because	the	facts	presented	in	this	2-part	series	will	very	likely	save
them	from	a	potentially	catastrophic	loss.


As	an	added	bonus,	after	reading	all	of	the	promotional	materials	on	this	company	and
realizing	how	brutally	dishonest	this	campaign	is	versus	many	others	we	have	witnessed
recently,	our	team	will	get	a	lot	of	satisfaction	from	publishing	a	very	in-depth,	factual	2-
part	series.

7/18/2019 Echo Automotive: The $155 Million Company Driven By Promotional Steam - Echo Automotive, Inc. (OTCMKTS:ECAU) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163721-echo-automotive-the-155-million-company-driven-by-promotional-steam 2/11


Considering	the	focus	of	our	current	investigation	and	how	it	is	arguably	the	most	exciting
short-biased	trade	setup	we	have	come	across	in	over	twelve	months,	it	is	time	we	begin
picking	apart	the	overly	hyped	and	fundamentally	lacking	high	flying	promoted	penny
stock	doing	business	as	Echo	Automotive	(OTCPK:ECAU).


It	is	our	team's	opinion	that	Echo	Automotive	presents	a	very	exciting	opportunity	for
short-biased	traders	because	there	are	a	massive	number	of	big	red	flags	surrounding	this
company	and	also	because	the	stock	has	recently	peaked	and	rebounded,	so	the
inevitable	drop	back	down	to	a	rational	valuation	is	quickly	approaching	-	almost	exactly
like	we	recently	experienced	with	USA	Graphite	Inc.	(OTC:USGT):


1.	The	annotated	chart	above	depicts	the	price	movement	across	the	entire	stock
promotion	from	start	to	finish	for	USGT.OB.	You	will	notice	that	the	campaign	from	start
to	finish	is	broken	down	into	A,	B,	C	&	D;


2.	Between	A	&	B	the	stock	promotion	is	underway	and	the	price	usually	trends	higher;
3.	Between	B	&	C	the	peak	is	reached	and	the	stock	plummet;
4.	Between	C	&	D	there	is	a	modest	rebound;	and
5.	Once	the	stock	begins	to	show	weakness	around	point	D	then	you	can	reap
massive	%	gains.


If	we	look	back	at	our	last	investigation,	short	sellers	that	entered	the	trade	at	the
beginning	of	weakness	during	point	D	have	been	able	to	generate	profits	greater	than
70%	within	8	trading	days.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163721-echo-automotive-the-155-million-company-driven-by-promotional-steam 3/11


ECAU.OB	is	incredibly	exciting	because	it	is	trading	at	a	much	higher	price	per	share	and
it	traded	over	$80,000,000	total	volume	during	the	past	several	weeks.	We	believe	this	is
important	because	it	is	likely	many	more	sellers	will	panic	once	they	see	weakness	at
point	D.


So	one	of	many	reasons	for	short	sellers	to	be	excited	to	learn	more	about	ECAU.OB	is
because	it	is	trading	in	a	very	similar	fashion	to	the	way	USGT.OB	did	prior	to	the
publication	of	our	report.


The	team's	goal	with	USGT.OB	was	to	wait	for	the	initial	run	of	the	promotion	(A-to-B),
wait	patiently	through	the	first	big	collapse	(B-to-C)	and	then	once	it	is	rebounding	towards
D	it	is	time	to	take	a	position.


This	is	precisely	what	I	believe	will	make	a	lot	of	us	money	this	time	around:


Wait	patiently	for	it	to	move	towards	point	D	and	short	the	unbelievably	overvalued
$155,000,000	company	that	generated	$6,000	in	sales	and	booked	a	$1,480,000	net	loss
during	the	3	months	period	ended	September	29th	2012.


After	Echo	Automotive's	initial	run	from	$0.75	to	a	high	of	$3.61,	the	stock	fell	to	the	low
$1.20's.	Since	then	it	has	rebounded	all	the	way	back	to	$2	-	making	now	the	precise	time
to	short	this	promoted	penny	stock	because	it	is	on	the	very	tail	end	of	the	campaign	and
is	very	likely	to	fall	apart	sooner	than	later.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163721-echo-automotive-the-155-million-company-driven-by-promotional-steam 4/11


So	let	us	get	started	and	look	into	the	reasons	why	we	have	been	very	confident	for	a	long
time	that	ECAU.OB	would	end	up	being	a	profitable	trade	setup	at	some	point	in	time:


On	The	Surface


Immediately	at	the	start	of	our	investigation	we	noticed	a	number	of	similarities	that,	in	our
team's	experience,	fit	the	characteristics	of	a	penny	stock	that	is	likely	to	be	the	subject	of
an	eventual	stock	promotion:


Recent	public	market	entry	via	reverse	merger	with	a	"shell	status"	company	that	had
very	little	in	the	way	of	a	real	business;


Subsequent	name	and	ticker	symbol	change	along	with	the	resignation	of	former
officers	and	directors	and	the	appointment	of	a	new	management	team;


Execution	of	a	recent	five-for-one	forward-split	during	a	time	when	insiders	and
affiliates	owned	a	large	majority	of	the	trading	float;	meaning	that	the	total	number	of
shares	outstanding	increase	by	a	factor	of	five	while	the	share	price	remains	the	same;


Development	of	a	corporate	website	that	one	could	reasonably	argue	is	marketed
more	towards	potential	investors	rather	than	customers	or	business	partners;


Production	of	a	well-crafted	investor	relations	video	and	presentation	emphasizing	the
opportunity	and	the	future	business	prospects	while	leaving	out	most	company
fundamentals;	and


A	substantial	increase	in	the	stock's	trading	volume	after	months	of	very	little	activity.


As	our	investigation	progressed,	we	identified	a	number	of	red	flags	pertaining	to	the
history	of	the	company,	the	company's	former	sole	officer	and	director	along	with	the
current	officers	and	directors.	Some	of	these	red	flags	relate	to	the	internal	business	itself
while	others	pertain	to	actions	made	by	past	and	present	officers	and	directors	that	fall
outside	the	scope	of	their	involvement	with	Echo	Automotive.


We	strongly	believe	that	a	number	of	these	red	flags	could	arguably	be	considered
material	information	despite	the	fact	that	none	of	them	appear	in	SEC	filings.


The	Tipping	Point


There	are	probably	hundreds	if	not	thousands	of	OTCBB	companies	with	a	large	number
of	red	flags	and	it	is	impossible	to	investigate	them	all.	In	this	instance,	the	tipping	point
that	led	to	our	full	blown	investigation	was	the	discovery	of	an	online	tout	sheet	backed	by

an	alleged	$3,000,000	budget	that	can	be	viewed	at	ECAUReports.com.


Shortly	after	the	$3,000,000	stock	promotion	campaign	was	discovered,	shares	of
ECAU.OB	soared	from	$0.75	to	a	high	of	$3.61	with	over	$75,000,000	worth	of	stock
changing	hands	during	the	19-day	span.	Promotions	of	this	magnitude	are	very	rare	so
our	team	made	the	decision	to	allocate	a	large	majority	of	our	resources	towards	this
investigation	in	order	to	shed	light	on	every	identifiable	fact	related	to:


The	company's	internal	business	environment	including	the	history	of	the	management
team;	and


The	$3,000,000	stock	promotion	featuring	Chuck	Hughes;	the	carnival-barking	editor
of	the	Micro	Cap	Research	Report	with	alleged	research	led	him	to	the	conclusion	that
ECAU.OB	"could	fly	past	$10.00	by	mid-year!"


In	light	of	the	fact	that	there	was	not	a	single	new	material	event	disclosed	that	would	have
been	likely	to	alter	the	fundamentals	of	the	business	and	its	intrinsic	value,	it	is	not	at	all
unreasonable	to	attribute	the	meteoric	rise	in	share	price	to	Echo's	stock	promotion
campaign.	Therefore,	we	expect	that	once	promotional	activities	cease,	then	the	stock	will
retrace	back	towards	its	original	levels	prior	to	the	start	of	the	promotion	($0.64).


However,	the	Fraud	Research	Institute	believes	that	an	eventual	64%	decline	from
prevailing	market	prices	is	too	conservative	of	an	estimate.	This	is	because	it	is	based	on
the	assumption	that	Echo	Automotive	traded	with	a	fair	valuation	prior	to	the	start	of	the
campaign	and	will	continue	to	trade	with	a	fair	valuation	over	time.	As	we	will	prove	in
upcoming	sections,	the	company's	market	cap	was	extremely	lofty	before	the	promotion
got	underway	and	if	the	market	corrects	this	lofty	valuation	over	time,	then	shares	could
drop	by	an	amount	much	greater	than	64%.


In	order	to	try	and	accurately	value	Echo	Automotive	prior	to	the	promotion,	it	is	very
important	to	look	all	the	way	back	starting	with	the	inception	of	the	company.


Corporate	Background


The	company	was	originally	incorporated	in	the	state	of	Nevada	on	September	2,	2008	as
Canterbury	Resources,	Incorporated.	At	that	time	the	company	was	a	pre-exploration
stage	company	engaged	in	the	acquisition	and	exploration	of	mineral	properties.	The
Company	owned	no	physical	property	although	it	acquired	a	100%	interest	in	a	mineral
property	referred	to	as	the	Kaikoura	Property	from	Plymouth	Enterprises	Resources,	Inc.
for	consideration	of	$5,000.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163721-echo-automotive-the-155-million-company-driven-by-promotional-steam 6/11


At	the	time	of	Canterbury's	incorporation,	their	corporate	office	was	listed	as	69	Stanley
Point	Rd.,	Devonport,	Auckland,	New	Zealand,	which	also	happened	to	be	the	personal
residence	of	their	sole	officer	and	director	-	Bruce	A.	Wetherall.	The	company	incurred	a
$300	monthly	expense	for	its	use.


On	December	30,	2008,	Canterbury	completed	a	private	placement	whereby	11,500,000
shares	of	common	stock	were	sold	to	Bruce	A.	Wetherall	at	$0.001	per	share	for	proceeds
of	$11,500.	Wetherall	sold	5,000,000	of	his	shares	to	some	private	investors	for
$0.01/share	shortly	thereafter.	Wetherall's	6,500,000	shares	gave	him	a	56.5%	ownership
of	the	company's	issued	&	outstanding	shares.


Bruce	Wetherall	was	listed	as	the	mining	company's	sole	officer	and	director	although	the
S-1	registration	statement	discloses	the	fact	that	he	does	not	have	any	formal	training	as	a
geologist.


A	quick	glance	at	Canterbury's	balance	sheet	and	income	statement	from	the	company's
annual	report	for	the	fiscal	year	ending	December	31,	2009	would	lead	any	rational
investor	to	believe	that	few,	if	any,	mining	operations	took	place	during	that	time:


Above,	you	will	notice	that	Canterbury	did	not	generate	any	revenues	in	2009	and	its
exploration	expenses	totaled	$0.	Combine	the	company's	lack	of	operations	with	the	zero
assets	recorded	on	the	balance	sheet	and	it	is	very	fair	to	say	that	Bruce	A.	Wetherall	was
either	unwilling	or	unable	to	execute	Canterbury's	exploration	business	since	its	inception.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1163721-echo-automotive-the-155-million-company-driven-by-promotional-steam 7/11


In	our	experiences,	it	is	almost	always	the	latter.	Public	shells	like	Canterbury	Resources
make	some	of	the	best	stocks	to	be	promoted	because	the	float	is	ideally	in	the	lands	of	a
small	#	of	people.


Beyond	acquiring	the	Kaikoura	Property	from	Plymouth	Enterprises	Resources,	Inc.	for
consideration	of	$5,000,	Canterbury	had	very	little	in	the	way	of	a	bona	fide	business	with
real	operations	and	it	is	not	unreasonable	to	suggest	that	Canterbury	was	created	merely
to	act	as	a	vehicle	for	a	reverse	merger.


Echo	Automotive:	The	Surviving	Public	Company


On	May	16,	2012,	Canterbury	entered	into	a	letter	of	intent	with	Controlled	Carbon,	LLC
dba	Echo	Automotive	to	execute	a	reverse	merger	whereby	Canterbury	acquired	all	of	the
issued	and	outstanding	units	of	Echo	in	exchange	for	the	issuance	of	approximately
52,500,000	shares	of	common	stock	to	the	members	of	DBPJ	Stock	Holding	LLC.


According	to	the	Arizona	Corporation	Commission,	members	of	DBPJ	Stock	Holding,	LLC
consisted	of	Jason	Plotke,	William	D.	Kennedy,	William	W.	Kennedy	along	with	each
individual's	family	trust.

Effective	May	16,	2012,	Bruce	A.	Wetherall	resigned	as	the	President,	Chief	Executive
Officer,	Chief	Financial	Officer,	Chief	Accounting	Officer,	Secretary	and	Treasurer	of	the
Company.


The	newly	formed	Board	of	Directors	would	consist	of	Jason	Plotke,	William	Daniel
Kennedy,	Jim	Holden,	Eric	Crown	and	Daniel	Clark.	Plotke	would	take	over	as	President
of	the	company	and	Kennedy	was	appointed	Chief	Executive	Officer.


Take	a	quick	glance	at	the	dissolution	of	DBPJ	Stock	Holding,	LLC	below.	It	is	a	subject
we	will	cover	in	much	greater	detail	in	Part	II	but	never	forget	that	research	will	always	pay
off	in	this	niche	because	it	is	unlikely	that	even	2%	of	retail	penny	stock	traders	are	aware
of	this	document:

EchoDrive™	Technology


Echo	Automotive	Inc.	is	a	developer	of	technologies	designed	to	convert	traditional	fleet
vehicles	into	electric	hybrid	plug-in	vehicles	by	adding	a	modular	plug-in	battery	pack	to	an
existing	vehicle	drivetrain.	Its	platform	is	marketed	as	the	EchoDrive™.


According	to	the	company's	website,	the	EchoDrive™	can	be	easily	bolted	onto	new	and
existing	vehicles	to	reduce	fuel	usage	by	up	to	50%	in	a	cost	effective	manner	that	offers	a
rapid	return	on	investment.


The	EchoDrive™	platform	utilizes	technology	owned	by	Clean	Futures	LLC	through	an
exclusive	worldwide	license	that	was	granted	as	part	of	the	licensing	agreement	dated
February	1,	2012.


The	Competition

Before	we	take	a	look	at	the	company's	current	and	former	officers	and	directors,	it	is
important	to	understand	the	vast	number	of	competitors	in	the	automotive	plug-in
conversion	marketplace.	These	competitors	have	already	made	far	greater	strides	than
the	company's	EchoDrive™	platform,	which	is	still	being	operated	in	"stealth	mode"	for	a
reason	we	cannot	figure	out.	The	corporate	video	on	Echo	Automotive's	website	alludes	to
a	"radical	and	new	approach	for	converting	fleet	vehicles	into	highly	efficient	plug-in
hybrids"	although	there	seem	to	be	other	companies	that	have	made	far	greater
advancements	with	very	similar	technologies:


Wrightspeed,	Inc.	received	a	$5.8	million	grant	from	the	California	Energy	Commission
to	accelerate	manufacturing	of	Wrightspeed's	Route™,	a	retrofit	powertrain	for	the
medium	duty	commercial	fleet	market.	Wrightspeed	also	raised	$10	million	in	private
investments	during	2010	and	2011.	The	company	uses	electric	drive	with	onboard
power	generation	to	make	powertrains	with	unlimited	range.


SINOEV	Technologies	Inc.	is	an	EV	power-train	company	backed	by	Cleiner,	Perkins,
Caufield	and	Byers	("CPCB").	According	to	the	Wall	Street	Journal,	CPCB	is	one	of	the
largest	and	most	established	venture	capital	firms	in	Silicon	Valley.


ALTe	PowerTrain	Technologies	is	a	developer	of	electric	and	hybrid	propulsion
systems	for	use	in	the	retrofit	of	light	to	medium	duty	fleet	vehicles.	According	to	the
company's	website,	the	ALTe	powertrain	retrofit	takes	13	man	hours	to	compete	and
results	in	an	80-200%	improvement	in	fuel	economy.


Mission	Motors	creates	powertrain	solutions	for	hybrids	and	EVs	based	on	its	own
technology	and	manufactured	components.


Besides	the	tough	competition	in	this	sector,	Echo	Automotive's	management	team	has
been	involved	in	several	failed	automotive	companies	and	it	makes	us	question	how	they
can	possibly	expect	this	company	to	perform	any	different.


Conclusion


Part	I	serves	as	a	primer	so	that	everyone	can	understand	why	this	is	one	of	the	top	short-
biased	setups	to	come	across	our	team's	desk	in	a	long	time.	This	is	a	$155,000,000
company	that	just	posted	$6,000	revenues	and	a	$1,480,000	loss	for	the	most	recent
quarter.


The	competition	is	incredibly	tough	and	ECAU.OB's	competitors	continue	to	make	real
strides	forward	on	a	daily	basis;

The	fact	that	Echo	Automotive	licenses	its	technologies	and	focuses	on	the	build	out	of
platforms	means	that	there	is	nothing	patentable	to	prevent	competitors	from	making
nearly	identical	products;
They	are	also	in	the	very	early	stages	and	purport	to	stay	in	"stealth	mode"	until
March;	and
The	formation	of	the	company	since	inception	fits	just	about	everything	I	look	for	when
seeking	out	future	large	scale	stock	promotions.


In	Part	II	we	dig	much	deeper	into	the	company	with	the	goal	to	publish	all	the	facts	about
this	overvalued	and	underperforming	company	that	investors	need	to	understand.


We	also	take	a	look	at	some	of	the	most	blatant	red	flags	that	I	have	ever	seen	from	one
small	public	company.


It	is	already	very	clear	to	see	how	lucrative	this	one	trade	may	be	for	anyone	interested	in
short-selling	the	most	irrational	and	hyper	inflated	stocks	on	Wall	Street.


However,	once	you	have	a	full	understanding	of	all	the	red	flags	surrounding	Echo
