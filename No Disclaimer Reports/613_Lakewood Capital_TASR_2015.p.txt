Lakewood Capital Short On TASER International, Inc. (TSAR)
April 27, 2015 2:55 pm  by VW Sta�


he following is an excerpt from Anthony Bozza’s Lakewood Capital Q1 letter to investors on


why they are shortTASER International, Inc. (TSAR) – stay tuned for more coverage.


Also see – Bozza’s GTAT short “Bozza admitted that their experiment was “crude and


unscienti�c,” analysts at the hedge fund simply dropped both of the phones on their faces from six


feet in the air”


Over the years, we have had good results shorting stocks of questionable value that are at the center of


the latest media or investor frenzy. For instance, one year ago, I wrote about our short position in a


company called Plug Power, a bene�ciary of the investment craze du jour at that time – fuel cells.


Since then, Plug Power’s stock has returned to earth, declining by over 60%. Whether the subject of


interest is clean energy, bird �u, 3D printing, Ebola or marijuana stocks, there always seems to be a


headline-grabbing theme that investors feel compelled to “play” through the stock market. Recently,


we have initiated a short position in Taser International, a $1.6 billion market capitalization company


whose shares have doubled in recent quarters as investors look for ways to capitalize on the likelihood


of increased use of police o�cer body cameras.


Taser International is widely known for its weapons segment, which produces stun guns that


represent close to 90% of total sales. While the weapons business is e�ectively a monopoly, it has


already reached nearly full penetration, and sales are now mostly driven by replacement demand. Last


year this business had record volume with 98,000 professional units sold.


Taser International’s sales


We believe a fair portion of these sales re�ects catch-up replacement demand from strained police


budgets coming out of the recession. On average, Taser sold 72,000 units annually over the prior nine


years. We believe the useful life of a Taser stun gun is seven to ten years, and given Taser

International’s installed base of approximately 600,000 units, normalized demand is well below


100,000 units. Additionally, we believe current operating margins of 35% may be at peak levels versus


a 17% average over the past �ve years. Taser has also touted opportunities in international markets,


but our research indicates that this has been slow to materialize (despite a decade of Taser’s e�orts)


due to cultural di�erences as many international police forces do not carry weapons at all. At a


generous 20x earnings, the weapons business would be worth $12 per share compared to Taser’s


current price of approximately $30 per share.


Investors in Taser International’s stock have high hopes for the company’s burgeoning body camera


business which allows police departments to record the activities of its police o�cers.


Taser International’s pro�t potential is questionable


While we recognize the merits of o�cers wearing body cameras, we believe the pro�t potential for


Taser International is questionable. Unlike Taser’s weapons business, the body camera business has


multiple well-funded competitors. Taser does not even manufacture its own hardware and sells the


cameras at breakeven to negative gross margins with the hopes of making money by charging for


cloud-based video storage. Many police forces already have in-house technology infrastructure to


support video for their in-car video systems, and they are often nervous about storing this data o�


premise. Even if agencies agree to cloud storage, we are skeptical they would be willing to pay Taser


very much for this given Taser in turn is merely using Amazon’s cloud service to store the data.


The body camera segment lost $19 million last year. Even presuming an aggressive market penetration


rate of 70% and a 50% market share for Taser, we struggle to see how this business is worth even $4


per share. Adding this value to our estimated weapons business value, we believe Taser International’s


shares have nearly 50% downside from current levels.
