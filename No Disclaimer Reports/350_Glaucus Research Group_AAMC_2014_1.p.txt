"Winter is Coming.”                                   -   George R.R. Martin, Game of Thrones


THIS RESEARCH REPORT EXPRESSES OUR OPINIONS. Use Glaucus Research Group California, LLC’s research opinions at 
your own risk. This is not investment advice nor should it be construed as such.  You should do your own research and due diligence 
before making any investment decisions with respect to the securities covered herein. We are short AAMC and therefore stand to 
realize significant gains in the event that the price of AAMC’s stock declines.  We are long RESI and therefore stand to realize 
significant gains in the event that the price of RESI’s stock increases.  Please refer to our full disclaimer on page three of this report.


ALTISOURCE ASSET MANAGEMENT CORP (NYSE: AAMC) (“AAMC”), a recent spinoff 


from Bill Erbey’s empire of distressed real estate and mortgage interests, is the asset manager for 


ALTISOURCE RESIDENTIAL CORP (NYSE: RESI) (“RESI”), which owns a portfolio of non-


performing mortgages (“NPLs”) and foreclosed single-family homes.  In exchange for these 


services, AAMC receives a quarterly incentive fee, which in Q4 2013 was equal to 32% of 


RESI’s dividends paid to shareholders (the “Incentive Fee”).  


We believe that AAMC’s Incentive Fee is at least four to seven times higher than the 


compensation received by similarly situated asset managers, and as such, is a sweetheart deal 


that will unjustly enrich insiders with a beneficial stake in AAMC at the expense of RESI’s 


shareholders.   


As shareholders of RESI, we believe that RESI’s independent directors have a fiduciary duty to 


either terminate or substantially renegotiate its asset management agreement with AAMC. 


To terminate the Asset Management Agreement between AAMC and RESI at the earliest date 


permitted under the contract (December 21, 2014), RESI’s independent directors must give notice 


of their intent to do so by June 24, 2014 (97 days from today).  We expect to sue RESI's 


independent directors for violating their fiduciary duty of loyalty to RESI’s shareholders unless 
they address the lopsided compensation deal given to AAMC.  RESI's independent directors are as 


follows:


 Michael A. Eruzione     (former captain of ‘miracle on ice’ 1980 U.S. Olympic Hockey team)


 Robert J. Fitzpatrick     (CFO of Institutional Mortgage Capital Canada, Inc.)


 James H. Mullen, Jr.     (President of Allegheny College in Meadville, PA)


 David B. Reiner     (Managing Director of Regional Real Estate Investment Corporation)


1. A Clear Conflict of Interest.  RESI does not have its own executives.  Rather, AAMC’s 


management team serves in a dual role as both asset managers and executives of RESI, even 


though they owe no fiduciary duty to RESI’s shareholders.  Furthermore, AAMC’s 
Incentive Fee is calculated by an opaque methodology and is therefore difficult to model 


(evidenced by the fact that Wall St. consensus estimates underestimated it by 454% in Q4 


2013), giving AAMC significant discretion in calculating its own paycheck.  Because 


AAMC’s executive team today owns far more equity in AAMC than RESI, AAMC’s 


management team is financially incentivized to generate large asset management fees at 


the expense of RESI’s shareholders. 


2. RESI Massively Overpays AAMC.  Wall St. analysts estimate that AAMC’s Incentive Fee 


will be 45% of RESI dividends in 2015, rising steadily from 32% for Q4 2013.  We believe 


this compensation is significantly higher than the market compensation paid to similarly 


situated asset managers.  


a. AAMC’s Incentive Fee is Worth $2.7 billion.  AAMC’s market capitalization reflects 


the net present value that the market places on AAMC’s rights under the Asset 


Management Agreement.  By firing or internalizing its asset manager (or substantially 


renegotiating AAMC’s fees), RESI’s independent directors could capture much of the
|LONG: Altisource Residential Corp
INDUSTRY:      Real Estate Finance


NYSE: RESI|
|SHORT: Altisource Asset Management Corp NYSE: AAMC|


value of AAMC’s management fees for RESI’s shareholders, which we estimate would
increase RESI’s share price by 114% and boost its 2015 dividends by at least $0.15 
per quarter per share.


b. Internally Managed REITs.  Analysts expect RESI to pay 40%-45% of its dividends to 
rent a small management team (AAMC has seven employees and no material assets).  By 
comparison, four internally managed mortgage REITs (NYSE: MFA, CMO, CYS and 
NLY) recently paid an average of 6.2% of their distributable dividends as compensation 
to their respective internal asset managers, suggesting that RESI pays AAMC over 7x
what similarly situated mortgage REITs are paying for internal asset management. 


c. Externally Managed REITs.  Widening the comp set to include twelve externally 
managed mortgage REITS shows that RESI pays AAMC around 4x more than the 
amount paid by other REITs to external asset managers.  


d. AAMC’s Straw Man.  RESI’s management presentation includes a misleading 
comparison of its asset management fees with SWAY, a REIT with virtually the same 
strategy and an almost identical portfolio of NPLs and single-family homes. This 
comparison is blatantly misleading, as SWAY’s asset manager has 545 employees and 
performs both asset management and property management functions.  RESI is paying 
more for less: at an 8% ROE, SWAY’s manager receives roughly $50,000 in fees per 
employee whereas AAMC receives $3.4 million per employee!     


3. RESI has the Contractual Right to Revisit the Asset Management Agreement.  A 
termination provision in the Asset Management Agreement gives RESI’s independent 
directors the right to cancel or renegotiate the contract in the event that two-thirds of RESI’s 
independent directors believe that AAMC’s Incentive Fee is unreasonable, which in our 
opinion, is self-evident given that AAMC is paid four to seven times more than comparable 
(not to mention larger and more experienced) asset managers.  


4. Independent Directors Have A Fiduciary Duty to Fire AAMC or Lower the Incentive 
Fee. We believe that RESI’s independent directors face the material risk of a shareholder 
derivative suit over the Asset Management Agreement with AAMC.  A potential plaintiff 
could easily argue that the independent directors violated their duty of loyalty to the 
corporation by giving AAMC a sweetheart deal on terms that are 4-7x above the market price 
for an asset manager.


a. Limited Disruption. RESI shareholders need not fear disrupting its relationships with 
Ocwen Financial (NYSE: OCN) (its mortgage servicer) or Altisource Portfolio Solutions 
(NASDAQ: ASPS) (its property manager), both related parties under the Erbey empire.  
RESI barely needs ASPS right now because it has few rental properties (RESI paid ASPS 
$2.8 million for property management and other expenses in 2013), making switching 
costs to another property manager painless. As for Ocwen (RESI paid OCN $9.3 million 
in 2013), mortgage servicers are a dime a dozen (Ocwen is fourth in the US residential 
space with 5% market share), making it highly likely that RESI can quickly and easily 
find a replacement.


5. Valuation. We believe that RESI’s independent directors have a fiduciary duty to terminate 
the Asset Management Agreement or, at the very least, significantly renegotiate AAMC’s 
Incentive Fees.  The market believes that the NPV of AAMC’s Incentive Fee is a staggering 
$2.7 billion. We project that RESI’s share price will increase by up to 114% and its dividends 
will increase by $0.15 per quarter per share if it captures ¾ of these expected cash flows.  
We also estimate that AAMC’s share price will fall by up to 87% as its compensation is 
brought in line with market rates. 


RESI’s independent directors must act quickly: with each passing quarter, AAMC’s 
Termination Fee will only get larger.  We estimate that if RESI terminates the contract in 
December 2014, the Termination Fee under the contract will be ~$55 million.  By December 
2015, we estimate that the Termination Fee will rise to a whopping ~$120 million. Winter is 
coming.

“TANGLED WEB OF CONFLICTS”


ALTISOURCE ASSET MANAGEMENT CORP (“AAMC”) (NYSE: AAMC), a recent spinoff from Bill 
Erbey’s empire of distressed real estate and mortgage interests, is the asset manager for ALTISOURCE
RESIDENTIAL CORP (“RESI”) (NYSE: RESI), which owns a portfolio of non-performing mortgages 
(“NPLs”) and foreclosed single-family homes.  


On February 26, 2014, New York State’s banking regulator, Benjamin M. Lawsky, supervisor of the 
state’s Department of Financial Services, released a letter to Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”)
(NYSE: OCN), RESI’s mortgage servicer, stating that his office found a “number of potential conflicts of 
interest between Ocwen and other public companies (including RESI and AAMC) with which it is closely 
affiliated.”  Mr. Lawsky expressed concern that such a “tangled web of conflicts could create incentives 
that harm borrowers and push homeowners unduly into foreclosure.”  


We believe that we have identified another significant potential conflict of interest in the Erbey empire, 
this time between AAMC and the interests of RESI’s shareholders. Specifically, we believe that RESI 
massively overpays AAMC to manage its assets, so much so that in our opinion, RESI’s independent 
directors have a fiduciary duty, prior to June 24, 2014, to provide written notice to AAMC of their 
intent to terminate or renegotiate the Asset Management Agreement by the earliest date permitted 
under the contract: December 21, 2014.

RESI purchases non-performing residential mortgages at a discount to face value.  It owns the right to 
collect mortgage payments from the debtors, and in case of a default, to foreclose on the underlying real 
estate.  After seizing properties through foreclosure, RESI rents out the homes as single-family units.  As 
a REIT, RESI is not permitted to retain its earnings and by law must pay at least 90% of its REIT taxable 
income in the form of shareholder dividends each year.  


RESI is a variable interest entity (“VIE”). As the primary beneficiary of the VIE, AAMC reports on a 
consolidated basis (with RESI), but to be clear, RESI owns all of the real estate and NPLs.  AAMC owns 
none.  AAMC’s only material source of income is the Incentive Fee pursuant to the Asset Management 
Agreement with RESI.  But RESI does not have its own management or executive team to safeguard 
the interests of its shareholders.  Rather, AAMC’s executives’ serve in a dual role as both asset 
managers and RESI’s executives.  


RESI separately pays Ocwen Financial Corporation (“Ocwen”; NYSE: OCN) to service its acquired 
loans.  In addition, RESI’s pays a property management fee to Altisource Portfolio Solutions S.A. 
(NASDAQ: ASPS) (“ASPS”) to manage any homes it has acquired through foreclosure on an NPL.  
RESI sits at the epicenter of a labyrinthine structure, with AAMC at the top.  The following diagram
illustrates the interlocking relationships between the four companies and the flow of funds within the 
structure.


Ultimately, we believe that AAMC earns too much to do too little.  We estimate that RESI pays AAMC 
seven times more than what internally managed mortgage-REITs pay their asset managers.  AAMC’s 
Incentive Fee appears to be a sweetheart deal that enriches the beneficial owners of AAMC at the expense 
of RESI’s shareholders.  


As a shareholder of RESI, we believe it is of paramount importance that RESI’s independent directors 
renegotiate or terminate this egregious contract by the end of 2014.  Not only would such a reduction in 
asset management fees (especially if RESI internalized AAMC’s team) be a boon to RESI shareholders, 
it would signal to the market and regulators the independence of RESI and its directors from the other 
companies in the Ocwen empire.

A CLEAR CONFLICT OF INTEREST


The letter recently released by Benjamin Lawsky, the supervisor of New York’s Department of Financial 
Services, raised the regulator’s concerns that Ocwen’s management has “the opportunity and incentive 
to make decisions concerning Ocwen that are intended to benefit the share price of affiliated companies, 
resulting in harm to … Ocwen’s shareholders as a result.”  


The letter highlighted that Ocwen’s chief risk officer was also the chief risk officer of ASPS “and 
reported directly to Mr. Erbey in both capacities.  This individual seemed not to appreciate the potential 
conflicts of interest posed by this dual role, which was particularly alarming given his role as Chief Risk 
Officer.”


We believe that the conflict of interest is just as clear in the case of AAMC and RESI.  RESI does not 
have its own executives or management team.  Rather, AAMC’s management team serves in a dual role 
as both asset managers and a rental executive team for RESI and, critically, report to Bill Erbey in both 
capacities (Erbey is the chairman of the board of both companies).  


RESI's prospectus makes clear that AAMC and its officers do not have a fiduciary duty to RESI
shareholders:


Even more critically, AAMC’s management team is financially incentivized to increase AAMC’s fees, 
even though higher fees reduce dividends paid to RESI’s shareholders. AAMC CEO Ashish Pandey 
owns 45 times more equity in AAMC than RESI: as of February 24, 2014, he currently owns over 
$40mm in restricted stock and options in AAMC and a paltry $875,000 in shares of RESI.

Further, outstanding stock options granted under AAMC's options plan have almost 10 times the 
intrinsic value of the options granted by RESI. 


In our view, this could not be a clearer conflict of interest.  RESI does not have a single executive, officer 
or employee to safeguard the interests of RESI’s shareholders, or to ensure that AAMC is not 
overreaching with its Incentive Fee.  Just as Mr. Lawsky recently objected to, the same executives report 
to Bill Erbey in both capacities.  Furthermore, because AAMC’s CEO owns far more equity in AAMC 
than RESI, AAMC’s management team has every financial incentive to increase AAMC’s asset 
management fees at the expense of RESI’s shareholders.


As if such misaligned incentives were not enough, the methodology used to calculate the Incentive Fee is 
opaque, and in our view, may be subject to tinkering and gamesmanship by AAMC.  


Investors should fear what they do not understand.  They should fear even more what Wall St. analysts, 
whose ubiquitous access to the management team and expertise in modeling, do not remotely understand.  


Prior to AAMC’s February 2014 earnings announcement and annual report, investors and Wall St. 
analysts modeled AAMC’s Incentive Fee as a percentage of cash dividends to RESI’s shareholders (a 
figure driven by REIT taxable income).  It therefore came as a great surprise to experts and laymen alike 
when AAMC announced that its Q4 2013 Incentive Fee was 454% higher than consensus estimates.  In 
the following chart, we compare the ex-ante estimates for RESI’s dividends and asset management fee to 
the reported figures.


This chart only serves to illustrate that while analysts accurately predicted RESI’s dividends, there was 
absolutely no understanding of how RESI’s performance influenced AAMC’s Incentive Fee. This
ambiguity permits AAMC significant leeway to determine its own compensation.  


Section 4(a) of the Asset Management Agreement provides that, in exchange for managing RESI’s 
portfolio of loans and residential assets, RESI shall pay AAMC an Incentive Fee of between 2% and 50% 
of the amount of “cash dividends paid by RESI to its shareholders” each quarter.  The Incentive Fee is 
structured as a waterfall: the more assets RESI acquires (and the better the returns on such assets), the 
greater the fee to which AAMC will be entitled.   The following is an excerpt of the contract: 


RESI Dividends Paid 4Q 2013

Any investor reading this clause would reasonably believe that AAMC’s Incentive Fee was calculated 
from the dividends paid to RESI’s shareholders each quarter.  RESI quarterly dividends, driven by REIT 
taxable income, are easily modeled and thus transparent to investors and analysts alike.  But as we saw in 
Q4 2013, this is NOT the case.    


In the very next sentence, Section 4(b), the Asset Management Agreement states “for purposes of 
[calculating AAMC’s Incentive Fee], RESI shall be deemed to have made quarterly distributions to its 
shareholders of all of its “Available Cash.” 


Available Cash is not a GAAP term.  Rather, it is a term in the Asset Management Agreement whose 
definition is so opaque that, in our view, it cannot be reliably predicted or cross-checked.  The Asset 
Management Agreement defines Available Cash as the sum of all cash receipts of RESI (plus any 
reduction in reserves) minus the sum of all cash disbursements (plus any increase in reserves):

The methodology is opaque, as evidence by the significant disparity between Wall St.’s forecasts of 


AAMC’s Incentive Fee and the fee paid in Q4 2013.  Whereas it is relatively easy to model RESI’s REIT 
taxable income, it is comparatively difficult to model quarterly cash flows from RESI to AAMC based on 


the information provided to the market.  


To the extent that AAMC’s Incentive Fee is based on either the subjective judgment of AAMC’s 
management team (such as the reduction or increase of reserves) or the timing of cash realization events, 


RESI’s shareholders should worry that AAMC’s payment is vulnerable to tinkering.  The overlapping


management, Bill Erbey’s control of both companies, and the opaque and unpredictable methodology by 
which AAMC writes its own paycheck, are compounded by the fact that AAMC’s executives are 


financially incentivized to generate the highest asset management fees possible.  In our opinion, such 


incentives create a clear conflict of interest, to the detriment of RESI’s shareholders.

RESI MASSIVELY OVERPAYS AAMC


Comparing the cost of AAMC’s Incentive Fee to the compensation structure of other internal and external 
asset managers of mortgage and single-family REITs shows just how much RESI is overpaying.  A
survey of comparable asset managers reveals that AAMC's compensation is currently around four to 
seven times higher than the market value for a manager of a portfolio of residential and/or NPL assets.  


1) AAMC’s Incentive Fee is Worth $2.7 billion.


The simplest way to determine whether AAMC’s Incentive Fee is reasonable is to examine the market 
value of the stream of payments it is entitled to receive under the Asset Management Agreement. 
AAMC’s only customer is RESI, and its only material source of revenue is the stream of fees it expects 
to receive from RESI.  In fact, the Asset Management Agreement includes an exclusivity provision 
preventing AAMC from managing the assets of other REITs.  As such, AAMC’s market capitalization 
should reflect the net present value of AAMC’s rights under the Asset Management Agreement.  
AAMC’s market capitalization is currently $2.7 billion. 


$2.7 billion seems a priori unreasonable to manage a loan portfolio considering that AAMC does not 
service the loans, manage RESI’s properties, and has only 7 employees, no assets and virtually no 
infrastructure.  To boot, RESI reimburses AAMC for the salaries of AAMC’s management team.  


Put simply, we estimate that RESI’s independent directors could capture up to 75% of AAMC’s
$2.7 billion in market value by firing, internalizing or substantially renegotiating the fees of a 7-
person asset management team whose salaries it already pays.  RESI’s independent directors have a 
fiduciary duty to investigate whether they can hire a competent asset manager (whether external or 
internal) for less.    


2) Internally Managed Mortgage REITs


Another methodology to compare AAMC’s Incentive Fee to the asset management fees paid by other 
REITs is to measure the fees as a percentage of dividends paid to shareholders.  The chart below sets forth
AAMC’s Incentive Fees and RESI’s dividends from Q4 2013 as well as the consensus Wall St. estimates 
for such fees and dividends in both 2014 and 2015.

Based on Wall St. consensus estimates, AAMC’s Incentive Fee will reach a whopping 45% of the 
dividends paid to RESI’s shareholders in 2015.  


In the following table, we calculated the total compensation and benefits, measured as a percentage of 
dividends, paid by four mortgage REITs (MFA Financial (NYSE: MFA), Capstead Mortgage Corp 
(NYSE: CMO), CYS Investments (NYSE: CYS) and Annaly Capital Management (NYSE: NLY)) to 
internal asset managers of their respective loan portfolios. 


The four mortgage REITs listed below have brought management of their loan portfolios in-house for an 
average of 6% of their dividends.  By our estimate, RESI will be obligated to pay AAMC seven 
times that amount (45% in 2015) or more going forward.  


We believe that the four REITs identified above are suitable comps because their management teams 
perform a similar function to AAMC: developing and implementing an investment strategy, identifying 
which loans to acquire and determining how much to pay for new loans.  Despite only having seven 
employees, RESI pays seven times as much as the four mortgage REITs to manage a portfolio of loans.

www.glaucusresearch.comSHORT: AAMC LONG: RESI


Both charts above show that RESI is paying more for less when compared to other internally managed 
REITs.  AAMC has seven employees, no material assets and a limited operating history.  AAMC does not 
service RESI’s loans (outsourced to Ocwen). AAMC does not service the properties it obtains through 
default (outsourced to ASPS). 


AAMC simply provides the experience and expertise of a small management team, led by 40-year-old 
Chief Executive Officer, Ashish Pandey, who as recently as 10 years ago was an ‘Associate Consultant’ 
with Tata Strategic Management Group and fresh off his MBA from Indian Institute of Management.


The following table is the cash compensation paid to AAMC’s management team: 


RESI is bestowing the right to a stream of payments currently valued (or overvalued) by the market at an 
exorbitant $2.7 billion to rent a seven-person management team who agreed to do the job for just over $2 
million in base compensation.  AAMC does not even bear the cost of its management team’s salaries, as 
they are reimbursed by RESI. 


Assuming an even moderately efficient labor market, RESI’s independent directors could obtain 
comparable talent for $10 million in base compensation per year, which would allow RESI to boost its
consensus 2015 annual dividend by around $40 million ($0.17 per quarter per share). 


3) Externally Managed REITs


Widening the comp set to include management fees paid to external asset managers of single-family 
REITs further underscores that RESI overpays AAMC to manage its portfolio.  


In the following table, we have outlined the actual compensation paid to the asset managers of twelve 
externally managed mortgage REITS.  Despite the fact that AAMC has by far the fewest employees, it is 
paid an average of 4x more.

Assuming an even moderately efficient market for external asset managers, RESI’s independent directors 
could obtain a perfectly competent external asset manager for $18 million in compensation per year (1.5% 
of book value of $1.2 billion), which would allow RESI to boost its consensus 2015 annual dividend 
by around $32 million ($0.14 per quarter per share). 


In addition, AAMC is performing fewer services for RESI than other external asset managers are 
performing for their respective REITs. AAMC has seven employees, while other asset managers have 
over 300.  Despite the fact that it has far fewer resources, AAMC is paid on average 4x more.

In our opinion, the two charts above show just how little RESI’s shareholders are getting for their money.  
AAMC’s paltry infrastructure, assets and human resources stand in stark comparison to the handsomeness 
of its Incentive Fee. 


Recently, American Homes 4 Rent (NYSE: AMH) took its asset management in-house, acquiring its 
portfolio and property managers rather than continuing to pay a 1.75x-book-value incentive fee.  In its 
public filings, AMH spoke of the savings it believed it could achieve by internalizing these services:


CYS also recently elected to internalize its external asset manager, noting in its public filings that there 
was virtually no impact to the results of its operations.


If AMH and CYS believed they could save on asset management by moving to internal management with 
limited disruption to their operations, and they were already paying at least 50% less than RESI, then 
RESI is surely being ripped off by AAMC.

4) AAMC’S STRAW MAN: SWAY


RESI’s most recent management presentation includes a slide which, at least first glance, appears to show 
investors that AAMC’s asset management fee is reasonable when compared to the fees paid by an 
alternative company, which clearly appears to be Starwood Waypoint Residential Trust (NYSE: SWAY), 
a similarly situated REIT.  


Source: RESI Q3 2013 management presentation, page 7.


We believe that this slide is blatantly misleading.  


In January 2014, Starwood Property Trust Inc. (STWD) spun off SWAY, which will directly compete 
with RESI to purchase NPLs for single-family homes.  SWAY currently owns 6,700 NPLs (versus RESI's 
8,054 NPLs) and trades for a market cap of $1.1 billion. SWAY is managed by privately held SWAY
Management, LLC (“¨SWAY’s Manager”), for a per annum fee of 1.5% of SWAY's market 
capitalization.1


The reason that the slide above is misleading is that SWAY’s Manager has more resources and provides 
more services for SWAY than AAMC does for RESI.  Compare SWAY’s Manager, with 545 dedicated 
employees, against the 7 employees at AAMC. Per RESI’s own management slide, assuming an 8% 
return on equity, AAMC’s Incentive Fee generates over $3.4 million per employee, whereas SWAY’s 
Manager will earn less than $50,000 per employee.2  
                                               
1 SWAY also reimburses Sway’s Manager for certain expenses, which are enumerated in its public filings (available here: 
http://investors.starwoodwaypoint.com/Cache/21620019.pdf?IID=4423541&FID=21620019&O=3&OSID=9)
2 SWAY’s Manager also manages a legacy portfolio of single-family rentals for Waypoint Legacy Funds, but this portfolio is not 
expected to grow and we estimate that it will comprise less than 20% of the assets managed by SWAY’s Manager in 2-3 years.

This simple comparison shows that RESI is getting a lot less for its money than SWAY. AAMC receives 
more than 70 times the revenue per employee in this scenario is that SWAY’s Manager is not only 
performing the asset management functions performed by AAMC, but also the life-cycle management of 
single-family units which RESI outsources to its sister company, ASPS.  


"our Manager will seek to retain approximately 545 employees currently employed by

www.glaucusresearch.comSHORT: AAMC LONG: RESI


Ultimately, the slide put forth by RESI comparing its fee structure to SWAY’s is misleading because 
SWAY’s asset management fees include compensation for both asset and property management, 
whereas AAMC only performs basic asset management services.  


Profit margin earned by ASPS on RESI property management services are expected to be highly material 
in 2015.  The following slide shows the combined incentive fees to AAMC plus the expected profit 
margin to ASPS in 2015.  The chart below reflects RESI's current book value of ~$1.2 billion.


Wall St. analysts estimate that RESI will spend between $40-60 million on property management 
expenses in 2015.  In order to make an apples-to-apples comparison, we can strip out the expenses like 
property taxes that would be 100% reimbursed by RESI and estimate the margin (roughly 30%) captured 
by ASPS on the remaining property management functions that SWAY's asset manager already provides.

If we tweak RESI’s management slide 7 to include the property management fees which RESI currently

unfavorable for AAMC.

**SWAY's asset manager provides renovation, maintenance, and leasing services to SWAY inclusive within its 
management fee (1.5% of market cap), whereas RESI has to pay AAMC and ASPS separately for the same services.  
We believe an apples to apples comparison must add ASPS fees to AAMC's Incentive Fee.
† Glaucus estimate based on a typical 30% general contractor markup on non-reimbursable expenses.  We believe 
this is conservative as ASPS earned a 36% operating margin on its Mortgage Services revenue (renovations/asset 
management) in 2013 (ASPS 2013 10-K, pg 29).  Mortgage Services (not Technology) is ASPS's most profitable 
segment.  
‡ Deutsche Bank and Piper Jaffray both assume that RESI pays ASPS ~$15K-$16K per renovation (conversion to 
REO).  However, according to page 8 of Piper's initiating coverage report, renovation fees to ASPS are excluded 
from construction fees as they are baked into the property balance.  Therefore, the fees to ASPS via the Piper model 
above may be significantly understated.

www.glaucusresearch.comSHORT: AAMC LONG: RESI


Rather than looking reasonable, RESI’s fees look egregious.  As shown in the above chart, investors can 
see that RESI is paying slightly more money in instances of poor performances, but 65% more on the 
upside.


This should undermine the myth propagated by AAMC that RESI’s shareholders are only obligated to 
pay hefty fees if the investments generate positive returns on equity.  Rather, RESI must pay a property 
manager irrespective of AAMC’s performance and it must pay AAMC if the investments succeed.  
Heads, I win.  Tails, you lose. 


The second reason that RESI’s comparison to SWAY is misleading is that RESI compares returns at a 
book value of equity at $1.2 billion. AAMC’s management has aggressive growth targets, and if RESI 
continues to raise money at a rate of $300 million per quarter, RESI’s book value of equity will reach $3 
billion by 2015 or 2016.  


Such growth would make AAMC’s Incentive Fees even more unreasonable as compared to SWAY’s 
Manager.  If we tweak RESI’s comparison slide 7 to include both the ASPS property management fees 
and a book value of $3 billion to match this growth forecast, AAMC’s fees look downright exploitative.

Ultimately, we believe that RESI’s straw man comparison of AAMC with SWAY, seemingly designed to 
convince independent directors and shareholders of the reasonableness of AAMC’s fees, is further 
evidence that AAMC is wildly overpaid. 


Note: same assumptions as prior slide, except book value of equity has been increased to $3 billion (and shares outstanding 
increased to 100 million due to expected equity issuance by RESI) from $1.2 billion.  This increases the profits to ASPS on 
a linear basis to $48 million from $19.2 million as well as increases SWAY's management fee on a linear basis with book 
value.  However, because of AAMC's waterfall fee structure, AAMC's Incentive Fee accelerates as book value is increased 
on an accretive basis to $3 billion from $1.2 billion.  RESI is expected to hit $3 billion in book value by 2016.

www.glaucusresearch.comSHORT: AAMC LONG: RESI


RESI CAN TERMINATE OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACT


The foundation for AAMC’s soaring stock price is the dangerous assumption that AAMC will be entitled 
to an increasingly lucrative Incentive Fee (at RESI's expense) as RESI raises equity and acquires more 
assets. But this is not necessarily so because of a termination provision in the contract which permits
RESI’s independent directors to terminate or substantially renegotiate AAMC’s Incentive Fee.


The Asset Management Agreement (Section 10(b)(ii)) provides that in order to terminate the contract, 
two-thirds of RESI’s independent directors must agree that: 


“the compensation payable to the Asset Manager [AAMC] hereunder is unreasonable; 
provided that RESI shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement … if the Asset 
Manager [AAMC] agrees to continue to provide the services under this Agreement at a 
reduced fee that at least two-thirds of the Independent Directors determines to be 
reasonable pursuant to the procedure set forth below.”  


Once RESI’s independent directors deem the Incentive Fee unreasonable, AAMC has the right to ask for 
a revised compensation structure.  If two-thirds of RESI’s independent directors believe the revised fee is 
still unreasonable, RESI has the right to unilaterally cancel the contract. 


Critically, the Asset Management Agreement does not define the word ‘reasonable’ as it relates to 
AAMC’s Incentive Fee, leaving RESI’s independent directors with considerable discretion.  The simplest 
way to determine the reasonableness of AAMC’s compensation structure is to look at the market price 
charged by similarly situated asset managers in the mortgage REIT space.  As we discussed above, we 
estimate that AAMC’s Incentive Fee is four to seven times higher than the compensation paid to other 
experienced asset managers.  


The Asset Management Agreement requires that RESI’s independent directors give AAMC 180 days 
notice of their intent to terminate the contract on the grounds that AAMC’s compensation is unreasonable, 
so in order to cancel the contract at the earliest possible date (December 21, 2014), RESI’s independent 
directors must deliver notice no later than June 24, 2014.  


Notably, Asset Management Agreement provides for a Termination Fee (measured as three times the 
sum of the average of the annual Incentive Fees paid over the previous 24 months) in the event that 
RESI’s independent directors terminate the contract. We estimate that if RESI terminates the contract in 
December 2014, the Termination Fee under the contract will be ~$55 million.  By December 2015, we 
estimate that the Termination Fee will rise to a whopping ~$120 million. 


RESI’s independent directors must act quickly: with each passing quarter, AAMC’s Terminate Fee will 
only get larger.  Investors should also note that RESI is not obligated to pay a Termination Fee under the 
Asset Management Agreement if it renegotiates (rather than terminates) AAMC’s Incentive Fees.  Any 
investor adverse to paying a Termination Fee or finding a different asset manager (external or internal) 
would look favorably on simply reducing AAMC’s current compensation.

FIDUCIARY DUTY TO TERMINATE OR MODIFY


We believe that RESI’s independent directors have a fiduciary duty to RESI’s shareholders to either 
terminate or renegotiate the Asset Management Agreement to lower RESI’s asset management fees.  


Skeptics may argue that Bill Erbey has stacked RESI’s board with friendly directors who would never 
authorize a course of action which would be adverse to Erbey’s interest, let alone terminating the 
relationship with AAMC, its sister company.  But this misses the point: the independent directors of 
RESI, regardless of their level of actual or perceived independence, are at risk of getting sued if they do 
not either terminate the Asset Management Agreement or at the very least renegotiate a much lower 
Incentive Fee.


1) Potential Breach of Duty of Loyalty


Under Maryland law, directors of a corporation such as RESI generally owe a duty of care and a duty of 
loyalty to the corporation.  In this case, a breach of the duty of loyalty would involve an alleged conflict 
of interest with regard to the selection of RESI’s asset manager, as well as to the negotiation of AAMC’s 
Incentive Fees.  


We believe that RESI’s independent directors face the material risk of a shareholder derivative suit over 
the Asset Management Agreement.  A potential plaintiff could easily argue that the independent directors 
violated their duty of loyalty to the corporation by giving AAMC, a company controlled by Bill Erbey 
(the chairman of RESI’s board of directors) a sweetheart deal on terms that are far above (i.e. four to 
seven times above) the market price for an asset manager. 


A derivative suit against RESI’s independent directors would be further bolstered by the facts that:


 The independent directors are contractually permitted to renegotiate AAMC’s Incentive Fees 
perhaps without having to pay a Termination Fee under the Asset Management Agreement;


 The independent directors are paying AAMC, by our estimate, four to seven times more than 
other mortgage REITs are paying external and internal asset managers;


 AAMC is controlled by RESI’s chairman and architect of the structure, Bill Erbey, raising the 
specter of undue influence over RESI’s independent directors by virtue of his resources and 
influence; 


 AAMC has only seven employees, no assets and little experience in the asset management 
market, especially when compared to third party asset managers for companies like NLY or 
TWO, which have access to hundreds of employees and a highly experienced operating team.


 AAMC’s management team is financially incentivized to maximize the Incentive Fee, which 
results in reducing the dividends payable to RESI’s shareholders.  


2) Kinder Morgan: A Noteworthy Precedent


On February 6, 2014, Jon Slotoroff, an investor in Kinder Morgan Energy Partners LP (“Kinder Morgan 
MLP”), sued Kinder Morgan Inc. (“KMI”), which serves as KMP’s general partner.  Slotoroff’s
complaint alleges that KMI used its control over the Kinder Morgan MLP to allocate cash flow 
distributions in bad faith.  Plaintiffs allege over $3.2 billion in damages since 2010.

The nuances of the allegations are important.  KMI’s compensation structure should be familiar to 
shareholders of AAMC and RESI.  KMI, as the general partner and asset manager, is entitled to a share of 
distributable cash dividends from the Kinder Morgan MLP, referred to as Incentive Distribution Rights 
(“IDRs”).


Plaintiffs allege that KMI, in bad faith, caused the Kinder Morgan MLP to misallocate capital 
expenditures to ‘expansion’ instead of maintenance,’ thus boosting distributions to KMI and diluting the 
value of assets held at the Kinder Morgan MLP.3  The plaintiffs are alleging a breach of fiduciary duty to 
the shareholders (in this case limited partners) by engaging in accounting gimmicks to maximize the 
amount of distributable profits to the asset manager at the cost of the long-term financial health of the 
MLP.  


This case is not perfectly analogous to the AAMC-RESI situation.  We are not alleging that AAMC is 
engaging in manipulative accounting tactics to artificially inflate the cash distributions to which it is 
entitled.  But it is critical because it is one of the first examples where shareholders are beginning to push 
against the asset manager of an MLP-type structure where the company holding the assets (i.e., RESI and 
Kinder Morgan MLP) has been cleaved from the asset manager (i.e., AAMC and KMI).  


3) Limited Disruption to Existing Relationships


It possible, however unlikely, that AAMC attempts to keep its outlandish fee by threatening that Ocwen 
and ASPS will cease to be RESI’s mortgage servicer and property manager (respectively) in the event 
RESI cancels or reduces AAMC’s Incentive Fees. Indeed, in the event of the termination of the Asset 
Management Agreement between AAMC and RESI, RESI’s contracts with ASPS and Ocwen will 
terminate within 30 days. 


Both Ocwen and ASPS are public companies, and their respective officers and managers are bound by 
fiduciary duties of both care and loyalty.  For either Ocwen or ASPS to reject an existing revenue stream 
simply out of spite or misplaced fealty to a sister company would raise problematic questions as to 
whether their respective officers and directors were acting in the best interests or the corporation and their 
shareholders or in the best interests of the Erbey empire.  We do not believe OCN or ASPS shareholders 
would allow it.


RESI paid ASPS $2.8 million in 2013, only $0.8 million of which was related to property management.  
As such, from RESI’s perspective, it currently has so few rental properties that switching costs to 
another property manager are low.   By contrast, ASPS derives 75% of its revenue from related parties, 
and although RESI currently possesses few rental properties, its fees to its property manager will increase 
in the future.  We therefore believe that ASPS has every incentive to continue its relationship with RESI
and has almost no leverage to walk away. 


Ocwen, on the other hand, is a large mortgage servicer that would barely notice if it lost RESI’s business.  
This should not be confused with leverage over RESI, because mortgage servicers are a dime a dozen.  
Ocwen is the fourth largest mortgage servicer in the United States (for single-family residential), yet it 
only controls a 5% market share over the residential home mortgage servicing market.  


The mortgaging service market is highly fragmented and intensely competitive, making it more than 
likely that if Ocwen wants to depart in a huff over AAMC, RESI could quickly find a suitable alternative.

VALUATION 


We believe that RESI’s independent directors have a fiduciary duty to terminate the Asset Management 
Agreement or, at the very least, significantly renegotiate AAMC’s Incentive Fees.  The market believes 
that the NPV of AAMC’s Incentive Fee is a staggering $2.7 billion. RESI’s shareholders should be 
overjoyed because RESI’s market capitalization should increase as it captures the majority of these 
expected cash flows.  We project that RESI’s shares will increase by up to 114% if RESI captures 75% 
of the market cap of AAMC, whereas in the same scenario, AAMC's share price has up to 87% to fall.


The following sensitivity analysis shows our projected reduction in AAMC’s share price and the 
commensurate increase in RESI’s share price with each 10% reduction in AAMC’s Incentive Fees. 


The implications for both companies are clear.  If RESI’s independent directors fulfill their fiduciary 
duties to shareholders, RESI’s shareholders should expect a significant increase in the REIT’s dividends 
and share price.  By contrast, this sensitivity analysis reveals that even a 50% decrease in AAMC’s 
Incentive Fees, which would still leave its overall compensation structure significantly above market for 
an asset manager, will send AAMC’s share price to $428 per share (and this assumes AAMC continues to 
trade at an absurd and unsustainable multiple).


If, as we expect, RESI’s independent directors bring AAMC’s Incentive Fees down to market rates (a 
75% decrease), it will reduce AAMC’s estimated distributable 2015 dividends by 87%.

AAMC’s issuance on March 18, 2014, of $250 million in redeemable preferred stock only puts AAMC's 
common shareholders in a more precarious position.  AAMC issued the preferred shares, which are akin 
to debt as they sit at the top of the capital structure, to ostensibly fund the repurchase of common stock.  
However, the holders of the preferred shares may require AAMC to redeem them for cash in March 2020.  
In the event that RESI substantially reduces AAMC’s Incentive Fee or terminates the Asset Management 
Agreement, such preferred shares would be difficult for AAMC to redeem assuming the Company 
already spent the proceeds of the issuance.      


The potential benefits to RESI’s shareholders are enormous.

We project that RESI’s shares will increase by up to 114% if RESI captures a significant part of the 
market cap of AAMC, whereas AAMC's share price has up to 87% to fall. As a shareholder of RESI, we 
therefore believe it is of paramount importance that RESI’s independent directors renegotiate or terminate 
this egregious contract.  


As a first step, we expect RESI’s independent directors to hire an independent advisor to conduct a 
market survey of asset management fees.  We believe that this will confirm that AAMC is vastly overpaid 
and the independent advisor can counsel RESI’s independent directors in either renegotiating the fees 
with AAMC, internalizing their asset management team (our preferred approach) or finding another more 
reasonably priced external manager.  Not only would such a reduction in asset management fees 
(especially if RESI internalized AAMC’s team) be a boon to RESI shareholders, it would signal to the 
market and regulators the independence of RESI and its directors from the other companies in the Ocwen 
empire. 


In order to terminate the Asset Management Agreement by December 21, 2014, RESI’s independent 
directors must give notice of their intent to do so by June 24, 2014 (97 days from today).  Because any 
Termination Fee would be much larger in 2015, we believe that any delay would cause material harm to 
RESI’s shareholders.  RESI’s independent directors must act quickly.  Winter, as they say, is coming.
