Plugging Into Some Reality: 
Fair Value of Plug Power is 50 Cents 





Can someone please bring me a vodka and some second hand smoke?  If we are going to have 
to hang around in a casino, let’s at least have the experience. 
 
Citron Research understands well the difference between a cult stock, dream stock, and a 
casino stock: 


 A cult stock has a devout following people devoted to its products; therefore it can 
be challenging to assign a valuation.  This could be either Tesla or Netflix.  Both 
deliver great products; hence a cult around their shares.   
 


 A dream stock is a stock with limitless blue sky.  Regardless of current financials, 
investors can always look to the future.  In dreamland, we have many biotechs and 
stocks in the 3D printing space.   
 


 A casino stock, by contrast, is the lowest form of speculative moonshot.  A casino 
stock can trade twice its outstanding shares in a single day, while turning over its 
entire float on people gambling that they can find a buyer at a higher price … Who 
really cares about anything else, right?   The recent volume and share price surge in 
Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) demonstrates how Wall Street treats this stock:   
nothing more than a casino. 


 
Who is behind PLUG, and what do they do?  This is simple: Plug Power sells fuel cell-powered 
forklifts … with fuel cells they acquire from Ballard Power. Nothing fancy here, folks. Same 
business model since the 2000 crash … Well over a decade as a public company, during which 
they have lost close to $850 million, while developing no IP or meaningful revenue growth.  
Profitability?  Forget about it! 
 
Citron will now explain why this stock is eventually headed right back to 50 cents (a blended 
average of all of their recent capital raises).  On Thursday management will issue earnings and 
guidance.   We warn investors.  YOU CANNOT TRUST MANAGEMENT GUIDANCE … Not Even a 
Little Bit.  Here is a history of broken promises and failure to deliver of Plug Power over the 
years:
Citron on Plug Power  March 11, 2014 Page 2 of 9 
 





Let us look at the promises over the years -- how they are not just misses but complete 
fabrications.  And why is any of this going to change???  Let;s start with recent guidance and 
comments and look back all the way to 2009. 


There was a lot of talk about orders in 2013.  
 


Actual Orders 
 


Millions, USD Orders Revenue 


2010 12 19 


2011 46 28 


2012 14 26 


2013 * (9 mos) 44 26 


 
(Orders calculated using year-end backlog revenue -- 2013E number based on management's guidance of 32 million 
orders in the 4th quarter, plus prior December 4th business update of 12 million orders between May to Oct 8


th
.  Revenue 


number is using Cowen's estimate, so 7 million wouldn’t be a surprise).   


 
 Results:  Shipments of fuel cells declined year-over year.  It simply doesn’t appear that 


an increase in orders is going to result in an increase in revenues.  
 





 
This investor presentation slide was made in June 2012:  








“We're also on track to meet our target of shipping $40 million of revenue in 2012….We 
see significant pickup with our present customer base and are forecasting annual orders 
to range as expected between US$50 million to US$60 million…We do expect that both 
a ramp in shipment volumes and an increase in share of shipments from new product 
platforms over the remaining quarters of 2012 will boost gross margins into positive 
territory.” 


-- CEO Andy Marsh, Q1 2012 conference call 


During the nine months ended September 30, 2013 we shipped 639 fuel cell systems to 
end customers as compared to 873 fuel cell systems shipped during the nine months 
ended September 30, 2012.” 


-- CEO Andy Marsh, Q3 2013 conference call
Citron on Plug Power  March 11, 2014 Page 3 of 9 
 











 Results:  2012 actual revenues were …  $26.1M.  Gross margins were -55%.  
 
2


nd
 quarter, 2011: 





 Results:  The company shipped 1,024 units in 2011.  
 








 Results:  2010 revenue of $19.5M and GM of -39%. 
  


“In line with our path to profitability, I would now like to reiterate Plug Power's 2010 
milestone. First, Plug Power will dramatically increase unit shipments for the year, 
shipping between 2100 and 2300 systems consisting of at least 1100 GenDrive and 1000 
GenSys fuel cells. Second, consistent with these shipments, Plug Power will generate 
between mid 40 and low $50 million in revenue. Plug Power will achieve a gross margin 
percentage in the mid-teens.” 


-- CEO Andy Marsh, Q1 2009 conference call 


My first question is about guidance, just for clarification. Your prior guidance was, I 
believe, 1,600 to 2,300 units shipped in 2011. Are you changing guidance now to just 
more than 1,600?...  
Well, Phil, I think based on where we're at and the additional orders that we expect to 
book at the end of the quarter, we expect to ship still in that target range but more 
towards the lower end of that range.” 


-- CEO Andy Marsh, Q2 2011 conference call 


Orders: 
“We see significant pickup with our present customer base and are forecasting annual 
orders to range as expected between US$50 million to US$60 million.” 


-- CEO Andy Marsh, Q2 2012 conference call
Citron on Plug Power  March 11, 2014 Page 4 of 9 
 


We dug back further through the past 4 years and beyond – there’s a consistent string of 
broken promises, and complete unaccountability for management guidance. Just like the above 
example, the company does not only miss earnings estimates, but are actively and intentionally 
deceptive in their projections.   
 
As far back has Citron Research can find, Plug Power has NOT ONCE delivered the amount of 
units that investors were promised.  The company’s promotional practices have become so 
outrageous that on their own website, posted as “company news”, they reprint an article from 
a Seeking Alpha poster: 
 


http://www.plugpower.com/News/CompanyNews/12-03-12/WHY_PLUG_POWER_COULD_DOUBLE.aspx 
 


  Results:  They missed this published estimated by close to 50%. 
 


   Money Talks … Bullshit Walks. 
 


Citron Research believes that management’s lack of honesty or conviction about the future  of 
their company was most evident last year.  While operating under a going concern from their 


auditor, the company did a capital raise at .15 cents …with a .15 cent warrant!  Guess how 
many shares management bought?  Below is a table of the capital raises of company during 
2013.  Management did not participate in ANY of these capital raises.  Management’s only 
participation was to take some stock in lieu of salary from a preexisting agreement while the 
company was on a trajectory to bankruptcy.

Plug Power Capital Raise Events in 2013: 
 





 
Date 


Shares 
Issued 


(Millions) Share Price 


Equity Raise 9/16/13 21.39 0.54 


Air Liquide Convertible Raise 5/8/13 10.97 0.24 


Equity Raise 2/20/13 43.42 0.15 


    Total Shares Raised 75.78 
  Average Price 0.27 
   


It should be noted that the equity raises above all had warrant coverage, which made the deals 
even sweeter for the investors … yet management was noticeably absent.   In contrast to Elon 
Musk, who committed nearly his whole life saving into his Tesla investment when they were 
just starting out, management of Plug Power wouldn’t even buy the stock at .15 cents just one 
year ago.

Following this span of extraordinarily trashy capital raises, management deception has not 
slowed down either.  In a February 26, 2014 interview CEO Marsh says: 
 





http://finance.yahoo.com/news/exclusive-interview-andy-marsh-president-185800025.html 


Almost exactly one week after making that comment, the company sold another $22.4 million 
worth of stock at 15% discount to prior day closing price ($5.75). Even Marsh himself could not 
ever dream this stock would ever get over $5, so the company helped themselves to yet 
another helping of the public’s money. 
 
OK, so what has changed in one year since the stock was .15 cents?  ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!   
IF ANYTHING THE STORY HAS GOTTEN WORSE.  All investors have to know is right in the public 
filings about the past year trends of the company: 
 


Revenue for the 9 months ended September 30, 2013 was $18.6M, vs $20.2M for the prior 
year.   Nothing more needs to be said. 
 


C’mon Citron- What about WalMart and FedEx?  Doesn’t that 
mean some great things ahead? 
 


Anyone close to the story knows that Wal-Mart and Fedex, amongst a few other multinationals, 
have been Plug Power Customers for the past few years.  The main reason is not because PLUG 
has built a better mousetrap but rather to take advantage of the 1063 Treasury Program that 
gives tax credits for renewable energy.  Wal-Mart, big user of these credits, has gone as far as 
to install solar panels on the roofs of many of their stores.

“The balance sheet's been the best it's been since I've been with the company. As of at 
our announcement in mid-January, after raising $30 million, we have $46 million on the 
balance sheet. We will use about $10 million in operating cash this year, and we will 
leave this year profitable, and so we see no need for cash to fund the present business 
plan.”

This is not Citron talking, but rather a Fuel Cell Industry Journal: 
 





http://www.fuelcelltoday.com/media/1889744/fct_review_2013.pdf 





   But All of this is About to End   
 
At the end of 2016, this punchbowl will get taken away, which can, in the company’s words be 
their deathblow.  In this 2012 letter to the House Ways and Means committee, CEO Marsh 
describes the need to continue Federal incentives to make their business work … and without 
them, the technologies are going to go overseas. 


http://waysandmeans.house.gov/uploadedfiles/plug_power_inc._fc42612.pdf 





This is disclosed in stark relief as a risk factor in their 10-K: 
 


 From 10-K for 2012:  
 
“Some conditions or contingencies that are out of our 


control may include, but are not limited to, government tax 


policy, government funding programs, and government 


incentive programs.” 
 


What is most astonishing is that even with government subsidies and “lack of competition”, 
Plug Power still cannot either make a profit or even grow revenue in a meaningful way.  
Imagine how bad this business will become at the end of 2016. 
  


“Materials handling vehicles (MHV) continue to be an important niche market for  
the fuel cell industry. This application was popularized in 2009 thanks to funding  
allocated from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which saw the  
subsidized sale of fuel cell equipped forklifts deployed at the warehouses of  
many high-profile American brands, including BMW Manufacturing, Coca-Cola,  
FedEx and Walmart.”

   Damned if You Do, Damned if You Don’t 
 


If by some chance, fuel cell forklifts do find themselves a market, there are numerous better 
financed companies waiting to enter the space – which has no competitive moat whatsoever 
protecting  it.  Here are two such examples of companies with plans established if demand 
increases. 
 
It seems like Plug Power’s only competitive advantage is going to be selling product at negative 
gross margin.   


If the business can every show financial viability, say hello to Still and Toyota:

forklift-truck-at-german-headquarters 





http://www.toyotaforklift.ca/pages/about-us/toyota-philosophy/environmental-focus/future-vehicles.aspx 


 
The only thing holding back Plug Power’s better funded competitors is the proof that this 
business can be sustained concept without subsidies.   
 
Plug Power does have one barrier to entry, though.  No one else wants to lose $800 million 
selling a product in which they don’t even own the technology. 
 


   Forget About Citron- What do the Other Professionals 
Have to Say? 
 


Alternative Energy and Clean Technologies are some of the most thoroughly covered sectors on 
all of Wall Street.  Despite the popularity of this sector, only 1 analyst covers Plug Power.  And 
who is this analyst?  It’s our pal Rob Stone from Cowen and Company!  Not too surprisingly, 
Cowen just facilitated an offering for PLUG.  
 
Cowen and Mr. Stone have assigned a price target of $5.50 to Plug Power, which we believe to 
be extremely generous.  Citron Research has had an interesting year with Mr. Stone and 
Cowen.  This is the same analyst that put a $46 price target on Unipixel in 2013 … the same 
month Citron focused its commentary on the company.  Citron’s take was a single digit stock. 
 


http://online.barrons.com/article/BT-CO-20130429-705604.html 
http://www.citronresearch.com/unipixel-stop-the-presses/ 





Needless to say the stock has gone from $35 to $10, while Cowen and Stone capitulated and 
eventually lowered their target to $10. 
 


http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20140102-703457.html 





Citron Research and Mr. Stone and Cowen met up again in November as he/they put a $62 
price target on VoxelJet.

tml 





The same month Citron published on VoxelJet: 
http://www.citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/vjet-Q1-comment-final.pdf 





In the following 5 months the stock has soared … from over $60 to $32. 
 
While we would love to call Mr. Stone incompetent, we will not.  Instead we will call him a 
“company man” who takes one for the team.  Cowen raises money and he puts out a buy 
recommendation.   It should be noted that even with his most glowing recommendation, he 
could only get to $5.5 a share on Plug Power(which is probably $5 too high,) 
 


Investors must note that unlike other clean tech stock – Plug Power owns no unique 
technology.  As we see in their filings: 
 


  Intellectual Property:  Nothing Special 
 


In their own 10-K, they admit they don’t have proprietary protection : 
 





http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1093691/000100329713000101/esplugpower10k1.htm 





Remember, Plug’s primary source for the power systems in those forklifts comes from Ballard 
Power.  
 


Gun to Head:  So I Have to Own a Fuel Cell Company… 
 


While we believe this entire space has entered a speculative frenzy, investors would be better 
suited buying Ballard Power(NASDAQ:BLDP), the actual power and technology provider to 
PLUG.  Also financially, even ignoring their recent run-up, there is a gross disconnect in share 
price … while Ballard has established multiple revenue streams with their fuel cell technology. 
 


Plug Power (PLUG):   
 Trades at 61x revenues  
 Market cap, fully diluted, (remember the warrants) currently valued $1.6 Billion 


 
Ballard Power (BLDP): 


 $810M Enterprise Value 
 Trading at “only” 13.2x sales (rough calc based on 10M warrants O/S) 





““We believe that neither we nor our competitors can achieve a significant proprietary 
position on the basic technologies currently used in PEM fuel cell systems.”

  Conclusion:  Plug Power in a Nutshell 
 


 No profits 
 No unique technology 
 No scalability 
 No demand 
 No brand equity 
 No media hype  
 No analyst support 


 
And this business shows no signs of improvement, only the looming end of government 
subsidies.   


 
Does anyone ever really end up a winner at a casino???
