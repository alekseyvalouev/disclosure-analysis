Executive Summary – China Shen Zhou 
Mining & Resources (AMEX: SHZ) 


In this Initiating Coverage Report, Absaroka will present compelling evidence that China Shen Zhou Mining & 


Resources (“SHZ” or the “Company”) is fraudulently misrepresenting its business and thus is massively over-


valued by the market at this time.  Prior to starting detailed research in SHZ, Absaroka was excited about the 


potential prospects of a mining company to supply China’s rapidly growing commodity needs for continued 


economic development.  Unfortunately, Absaroka’s due diligence process unearthed a plethora of serious 


concerns about the validity of the Company, including: 


1. SHZ’s main product is fluorite (a.k.a fluorspar or CaF2):  Despite a common misconception in the 


market, fluorite is not a rare earth nor does SHZ have any exposure to the rare earths business 


2. SHZ Management is significantly exaggerating the size of critical mines:  For example, its fluorite 


mine supposedly has a production capacity of >2x historical output and the Qingxing mine is 


allegedly 777.4km long, which would make it one of the world’s largest underground mines and 


violate the sovereignty  of Mongolia 


3. SHZ’s FY11 guidance cannot be reconciled with prior results and Management is making promises it 


cannot meet:  Even if SHZ is able to achieve its extremely aggressive production forecasts of >2x 


volume growth, the implied commodity prices are irrationally high based on the revenue guidance 


4. The recent Xinyi Fluorite Company investment appears to be a fraudulent scheme to transfer equity 


to related parties and includes a put-option that is highly dilutive to public shareholders 


5. Significant CFO turnover, low quality auditors, and a dubious Audit Committee raises grave concern 


about the validity of published historical financials and forward-looking guidance:  2 of the auditors 


of the alleged China Education Alliance (NYSE: CEU) fraud have also signed off on SHZ’s financials 


6. Audit Committee Chairman and Independent Director Mr. Gene Michael Bennett appears to have a 


fabricated employment history, a non-existent CPA certification, overstated educational 


achievements, and has been a Board member for four other Chinese reverse-merger frauds  


7. Multiple material differences between Management statements and reality, including a 60% miss on 


FY09 fluorite production guidance, mysterious fluorite pricing data, and failed development projects 


8. The recent trading history was significantly impacted by the Company’s prolific and misleading 


investor relations effort while insiders were selling stock prior to the $20mm equity offering 


9. $20mm equity offering in January 2011 had no rational explanation based on business needs and 


significantly increases the risk of corporate malfeasance 


Any of these serious issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public shareholders to 


question the current $5.25/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” form of shareholder activism.  


Recommendation:  CONVICTION SELL 
Price Target: $1.25

1:  SHZ’s Main Product is Fluorite (a.k.a Fluorspar or CaF2) - Fluorite is 


not a rare earth element nor does SHZ have any exposure to the rare 


earths business, despite a common misperception in the market 
Based on statements from numerous investors and commentators, the market apparently believes SHZ is a 


producer of rare earths and/or has exposure to the sky-rocketing rare earths business.
3
  While prices for rare-


earth metals have soared to record heights (cerium oxide is currently trading at $71,000 per ton, up 992% 


from July 2010 and lanthanum oxide is at $73,000 per ton, up 769% from July 2010), fluorite prices have only 


increased approximately 19% over the same time period according to Industrial Minerals.
4
  SHZ’s main 


product is fluorite, which is not a rare earth element, and SHZ is not certified by the People’s Republic of 


China to mine, process, refine, export or use rare earths.  Because of the false belief about rare earths 


exposure, SHZ has traded up in correlation with other rare earths equities (the Bloomberg Rare Earth Equity 


Index is up 273% from 07/08/10 to 03/04/11) and thus is massively over-valued by the market at this time.   


Please review Appendix B for the complete list of Chinese certified rare earth companies. 


Unlike rare earths, a significant portion of the global fluorite demand, geological reserves, and production 


occurs outside of China.  Moreover, the United States’ core allies, such as Mexico, Spain, and South Africa, 


have both significant fluorite production capacity and economically viable, proven geological reserves.  Also, 


the refiners, processors, and end-users of fluorite are distributed globally, which is significantly different from 


the very narrow rare earths value chain, in which most of China’s rare earth ore is shipped directly to Japan 


for further refining and inclusion in value-added goods; the rare earths value chain has been significantly 


impacted by recent political tension between China and Japan.  Finally, multiple substitutes, recycling, and 


the synthetic production of fluorite in chemical and industrial processes result in elastic demand and 


drastically dampens price volatility relative to rare earths. 


Geo-Political Supply Considerations: Fluorite vs. Rare Earths5 
Due to the global production capacity, 


fluorite does not benefit from the 


same geo-political supply 


considerations and scarcity premium 


as the rare earths.  Moreover, the U.S. 


Congress is not placing any 


importance on the sources of the 


fluorite supplies or advocating the 


stockpiling of fluorite supplies for 


defense industry applications.
6


  As 


discussed in greater detail in the following table, rare earths are critical components for numerous critical 


modern military and green technologies, while fluorite is mainly a basic feedstock for industrial and chemical 


processes.

Description • Halide mineral composed of calcium fluoride (CaF
2
) 


• Isometric shape with a cubic habit configuration, 
though octahedral and more complex isometric 
forms are not uncommon 


• 17 chemically similar metallic elements 
• Elements number 21, 39, and 57-71 on the periodic 


table 


Classification Classified based on purity: 
• Metallurgical grade - low 
• Ceramic grade fluorite - medium 
• Acid grade - high 


Classified based on atomic weight and location on the 
periodic table: 
• Heavy Rare Earth (HREE) 
• Light Rare Earth (LREE) 


Uses • Metallurgical grade used as a flux to lower the 
melting point of raw materials in steel production 


• Ceramic grade fluorite is used in the manufacture of 
opalescent glass, enamels and cooking utensils 


• Acid grade is used to make hydrofluoric acid by 
decomposing the fluorite with sulfuric acid 


• Precision-guided munitions 
• High-energy lasers 
• Night vision equipment 
• Radar systems 
• High-efficiency magnets and fiber optics 
• Hybrid car batteries and motors 


Recycling & 
Synthetic 
Production 


• Aluminum producers recycle hydrofluoric acid and 
fluorides from smelting operations 


• Hydrofluoric acid is also recycled in the petroleum 
alkylation process 


• Synthetic fluorspar is recovered from uranium 
enrichment, petroleum alkylation and stainless steel 
pickling 


• Difficult to recycle economically 
• Not possible to synthetically create elements 


Substitutes • Aluminum smelting dross, borax, calcium chloride, 
iron oxides, manganese ore, silica sand, and 
titanium dioxide have been used as substitutes for 
fluorspar fluxes 


• Fluorosilicic acid has been used as a substitute in 
aluminum fluoride production and also can be used 
as a substitute in hydrofluoric acid production 


• Limited at this time 
• Difficult to replace without losing performance 


SHZ’s Historical Fluorite Pricing and Sales Volume9 
As clearly visible below, while SHZ’s realized fluorite pricing increased to record levels in FY08, sales volume 


dropped by over 50%.  Fluorite sales volume recovered slightly in FY09 to 40,056 tons, but SHZ’s VWAP 


fluorite price decreased 22%.  In 3Q10, fluorite pricing increased slightly from FY09 levels, but the annualized 


sales volume was at a record low relative to prior full-year results.  Thus, SHZ’s fluorite business has not 


benefited from inelastic demand and sky-rocketing prices like some of the Chinese rare earth producers.

Sumochaganaobao Fluorite Mine – Approximately half the size SHZ claims 


SHZ’s Sumochaganaobao fluorite mine was acquired in 2002 from a state-owned enterprise and has 


been expanded to transition from the historical open-pit operations to underground mining; at this 


time, most of the fluorite veins economically accessible via open-pit mining have been depleted.  


Located on the high altitude, desert steppes of Inner Mongolia, the mine has historically been forced to 


close during the winter due to the extreme weather conditions.   


The Sumochaganaobao fluorite mine is extremely isolated and thus the operating costs of the mine are 


significant higher relative to fluorite producers with reserves in southern China.  Located approximately 


90km from the nearest town on a mud road, all supplies to the mine and all the ore from the mine must 


be transported via truck, which is significantly more expensive than rail transport.  Prior to 2007, all 


electrical power for production and the miners living quarters was produced on-site with inefficient 


diesel generators, which were quite expensive to operate and maintain.  Although the mine is now 


connected to the state power network, the mine’s operating costs do not appear to have materially 


improved.  Water for the production processes and the miners’ living needs is sourced from three wells 


about one kilometer away from the mine; the arid climate makes it difficult to secure alternative water 


supplies. 


According to SHZ’s 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings, in its best operating year, Sumochaganaobao achieved 


fluorite sales volume of 74,971 metric tons.  However, fluorite volumes have been materially lower since 


FY07, despite several operational improvements, with 40,056 metric tons in FY09 and annualized 3Q10 


sales (prime mining season in Inner Mongolia) were only 28,736 metric tons.  Because of the low 


historical production volumes and the significant production issues discussed in the next section, 


Absaroka is highly confident the annual fluorite production capacity of Sumochaganaobao is 


approximately half of the 150,000 metric tons claimed by Management.

STRICTLY PRIVATE & CONFIDENTIAL 


 China Shen Zhou Mining & Resources (AMEX: SHZ) Page 8 
 


Sumochaganaobao Fluorite, continued – Approximately half the size SHZ claims  
 


Absaroka is aware of at least two fatal flaws which limits SHZ’s production at Sumochaganaobao:   


First, underground mining requires detailed engineering and operational optimization to ensure the 


mine access is large enough to handle the throughput of miners starting shifts and supplies (bolting 


steel, explosives, cement, etc.) entering the mine and the backhaul of ore, waste rock, and miners 


ending shifts out of the mine.  Based on estimated throughput/backhaul calculations for the 


Sumochaganaobao facility performed by Absaroka’s mine engineering consultant, it is difficult to believe 


that the maximum annual production from the underground mine could ever be more than 75,000 


metric tons of fluorite.  This significant production constraint is also visible when comparing the scale of 


Sumochaganaobao’s main shaft mine entrance to a legitimate mining project, such as Teck’s Galore 


Creek.
13


  For an approximate comparison of the relative mine entrances, please compare the size of the 


set of stairs (approximately 1 meter tall) on the left side of the Sumochaganaobao entrance relative to 


the size of the group of people standing (approximately 2 meters tall) in front of Galore Creek.   















































Second, access to adequate water supply is a critical component for a successful mining facility as large 


amounts of clean water are required to separate concentrated ore from waste rock.  Historically, SHZ 


has had problems with the Sumochaganaobao water supplies “temporarily *failing to+ meet processing 


requirements for large-scaled production.”
14


  Northern China is currently experiencing the worst 


drought in at least 60 years and drinking water is being rationed in communities surrounding Beijing.
15


  It 


seems highly implausible SHZ will now be able to get enough water in 2011 for its critical mine located in 


the high altitude, desert steppes of Inner Mongolia when even industrialized city dwellers cannot find 


enough water.   








Difficult to Believe Sumochaganaobao’s Annual Fluorite Production Could Ever Be More Than Half of 


the 150,000 Metric Tons Claimed by Management

The Qingxing Zinc & Copper Mine was established in 


2003 and acquired by SHZ in 2006.  The mine has 


been intermittently closed by SHZ since its 


acquisition due to the high cost of extracting its 


lower-grade ore relative to the price of zinc and 


copper concentrate, especially during the extreme 


Inner Mongolia winters; in 2009, the mine produced 


very few products because of “technological 


difficulties.”
16


  As of 12/03/10, SHZ Management 


expects to keep the mine open throughout FY11 and 


increase production levels by approximately 270% 


over the historical average levels since FY07.  


However, the high production costs for the ore 


relative to the prices of zinc and copper concentrate will limit free cash flow generation in FY11. 


According to SHZ’s SEC filings, the mine coordinates 


are E106º45′15″-106º45’45”, N47º57′14”-40º57′45”, 


which implies the mine is 777.4km long, crosses the 


international border into Mongolia, and proceeds to 


the outskirts of Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia.
17


   For 


reference, this claimed length makes it one of the 


world’s largest underground mines and is 


approximately twice the length of the trenched 


portion of the Great Wall of China.  Absaroka is 


highly confident the mine is significantly smaller 


than the 777.4km length SHZ Management claims.  


Based on the age of the mine, the main shaft is likely 


at most 20km long, assuming an aggressive 2,500m 


of mainline shaft progress per year of operation.   


Other Major Operations 


SHZ’s Keyinbulake Project in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region of China is currently in the 


exploration stage with significant development risk and a long horizon before any potential positive free 


cash flow generation.  In 2009, political unrest and violence because of ethnic conflicts between the 


minority Uygur and the Han Chinese in Xinjiang Uygur prevented SHZ from accessing the project site.

3.  SHZ’s FY11 Guidance – Not possible to reconcile with prior results and 


SHZ appears to be making promises it cannot meet 
On 12/03/10, SHZ distributed the press release entitled “China Shen Zhou Announces Operational and 


Financial Guidance” which provided forward-looking statements on FY11.  For reference, below is a 


quotation of the relevant section of the press release (emphasis added for clarity): 


“For 2011, China Shen Zhou expects production to reach approximately 60,000 metric tons of 


fluorite powder and approximately 40,000 metric tons of fluorite lumps. Nonferrous metal 


production should reach approximately 15,000 metric tons of zinc concentrate (equal to 


7,000 metric tons of zinc metal) and nearly 1,500 metric tons of copper concentrate (equal to 


280 metric tons of copper metal) in the 2011 year...For the year to end December 31, 2011, 


net revenues are expected to approximate $38.0 million, a 164% increase compared with the 


2010 estimated net revenues of $14.5 million. All this anticipated growth is organic from the 


current product portfolio. Net income for the 2011 year is estimated to reach approximately 


$11.0 million.“ 


Utilizing some simple arithmetic, it becomes crystal clear that SHZ’s FY11 forecast cannot be relied upon, 


even if one makes the heroic assumption that SHZ is able to achieve its extremely aggressive production 


forecasts despite the fatal mine flaws discussed in the prior sections.  Please review Appendix C for a 


complete reconciliation of Absaroka’s calculations and third-party data sources. 


In summary, after backing-out the revenue associated with SHZ’s estimated FY11 zinc and copper 


concentrate sales by utilizing forward pricing data from the Shanghai Futures Exchange, it appears SHZ is 


forecasting its volume-weighted average fluorite price to increase by approximately 124.0% from its 


realized 3Q10 fluorite price and 135.6% from its fluorite VWAP from FY06-FY09.  Based on independent, 


third-party fluorite data from Industrial Minerals, the highly regarded global non-metallic minerals 


pricing data and news source, SHZ’s pricing growth forecast is comically aggressive and does not 


reconcile with forecasts from other fluorite industry participants.  For example, Industrial Minerals data 


shows Chinese Metallurgical Fluorspar pricing in 2011 has only increased approximately 16.3% since 


09/30/10 versus SHZ’s forecast of 124.0%.
19


  Moreover, based on discussions Absaroka’s in-country 


investigator had with Chinese fluorite industry participants, SHZ’s Inner Mongolia fluorite vein deposits 


have significantly higher levels of naturally occurring silica impurities versus southern producers, which 


will limit SHZ’s ability to increase pricing over its historical levels.  Finally, it is critical to note that SHZ 


specifically mentions the financial guidance is “organic from the current product portfolio,” so the 


January acquisition of Xinyi Fluorite would be additive to the December FY11 financial guidance.   


Thus, based on the massive forecasted production volume growth and aggressive commodity pricing 


estimates, Absaroka is highly confident SHZ’s FY11 financial guidance cannot be relied upon and the 


FY11 results will most likely only be incrementally better than the operating losses and negative free 


cash flow SHZ achieved in FY07.

4:  Xinyi Fluorite Company Investment – Deal structure includes a dilutive 


equity put-option and shockingly low transaction multiples20  
On January 13, 2011, SHZ announced it signed a $13.5mm equity transfer agreement with the shareholders 


of Xinyi Fluorite Company Ltd. (“Xinyi”) in order to acquire a 55% equity interest in the company.  Xinyi was 


established in 2003, operates in Anhui Province (southeastern China),  and purportedly operates three 


fluorite mines.  Because Xinyi is located 2,000km from SHZ’s current mine and freight costs are a significant 


consideration for the end-users of fluorite, it is difficult to understand how Management intends to, as per 


the press release, “leverage our sales, production, and our marketing network” to successfully integrate 


these geographically separate mines, especially as SHZ currently does “not employ any marketing staff.”
21





Moreover, analysis of the Equity Transfer Agreement filed with the SEC raises several material concerns.  


First, SHZ is paying for a majority, $7.6mm, of the acquistion with parent company stock (i.e. issuing new 


AMEX shares).  As per contract point 4.9 “Party B *SHZ+ warrants that the equity share value of the Parent 


Company in the amount of RMB fifty million Yuan [$7.6mm] will not devalue, otherwise Party B [SHZ] shall 


make up the difference.”  This equity put-option deal structure is extremely disadvantegous to SHZ public 


shareholders.  As SHZ has traded down since the January 13
th


 announcement, the potential number of shares 


to be issued has increased by approximately 67%, which will further dilute public shareholders.  For example, 


one of the key catalysts in the collapse of Enron was the exercise of the equity put-options after the 


implosion of the Raptor II and LJM Management off-balance sheet partnerships.  


Next, SHZ is also allowing Mr. Min Yong (10%) and Mr. Wang Changman (5%) to acquire ownership stakes in 


Xinyi for $0.9mm and $0.5mm, respectively.  These acquisition prices for Mr. Min Yong and Mr. Wang 


Changman represent a 64% and 57%, discount respectively, to SHZ’s cost basis for Xinyi and further dilutes 


SHZ’s public shareholders.  Absaroka’s in-country investigator found indications Mr. Yong and Mr. Changman 


are commodity traders with prior dealings with SHZ management; if anything, this structure is analogous to 


“letting the fox into the henhouse.”  According to SHZ, Mr. Yong and Mr. Changman received the acquistion 


discount because they paid cash versus SHZ’s cash/equity, but this a deceitful excuse because the selling Xinyi 


shareholders are protected by the put-option on the SHZ shares.  Finally, although SHZ acquired a 55% equity 


interest in Xinyi and is the majority contributor to the renovation fund, the conditional profit sharing 


agreement limits SHZ’s percentage to less than 50% of future potential production. 


Lastly, SHZ forecasted Xinyi will generate $10mm in revenue and $5-6mm net income in FY11 (an implausible 


55% margin for a commodity business),  which implies total enterprise value transaction multiples of 2.4x 


revenue and 4.4x net income.  Because of these extremely low transaction multiples, it appears either 1) the 


Xinyi transaction was conducted at arms-length and these very low multiples are indicative of the intrinsic 


value of Chinese fluorite miners, or 2) Xinyi is not a legitimite fluorite miner and the transaction is a 


fraudulent scheme to transfer equity to related parties.  Taking into account the even more shocking FY11 


net income implied acquisition multiples of 1.6x and 1.9x for Mr. Yong and Mr. Changman, respectively, 


Absaroka is highly confident the Xinyi transaction is fraudulent and is not fair to public shareholders. 


For a complete transaction spread of the Xinyi investment, please review Appendix D located at the end of this report.

Who Art Thou? – Incompetent at best and potentially a fraudster 
In the October 2010 proxy statement, SHZ provided the following description of Mr. Gene Michael 
Bennett, Chairman of the Audit Committee and Independent Director (emphasis added for clarity).


29
 


“Mr. Gene Michael Bennett is Director and Chairman of the Audit Committee. He has 
over 25 years’ experience as CFO, Professor and Consultant. His abundant working 
experience in China has assisted Chinese firms to develop "Good Corporate Governance" 
and transparent infrastructures.   He is a CPA (inactive), and has experience working for 
one of the top auditors in the world, Grant Thornton. He graduated from Michigan State 
University.  Currently, he also holds position for another US-listed Chinese company:  
Kunming Shenghuo Pharmaceutical (AMEX: KUN) (Independent Director)” 


Mr. Gene Michael Bennett’s Publicly Available Information Summary 


Note:  Red shading indicates companies that have agreed to shareholder settlements in litigation involving making false and 
misleading statements or have been accused by creditable investors of making false and misleading statements 


 
Four out of the six companies’ Boards of Directors Mr. Gene Michael Bennett has recently served on 
appear to have defrauded public investors; at a minimum, he is failing to assist “Chinese firms develop 
Good Corporate Governance.”  For additional details on the rest of the SHZ’s Board of Directors and 
Management Team, please review Appendix E at the end of this report.

metric tons of fluorite in FY09


39
 


• Actual FY09 fluorite production was 40,056 metric tons, a 60% miss from Management’s guidance
40


 
• Annualized 3Q10 production was just 28,736 metric tons of fluorite 


Kuru-Tegerek 
Copper-Gold 
Project 
Failure 


• On 11/06/06, SHZ acquired the Kuru-Tegerek Cu-Au project in Kyrgyz Republic for $10.0mm from two  
Chinese private investors


41
 


• SHZ expected to construct the mine and begin full production within three years of the acquisition
42


 
• On 09/21/09, SHZ had yet to commence mine construction after costs of $1.9mm and sold the project 


for only $8.2mm (~30% implied loss), despite a dramatic increase in copper and gold prices over the 
period SHZ owned the project


43
 


Mysterious  
Fluorite 
Pricing 
Data 


• SHZ Management claimed “the price for fluorite ore increased approximately 30% per year from 2004 
to 2006” according to data from the “Shanghai Future Exchange”


44
 


• The only commodities traded on the Shanghai Futures Exchange are gold, copper, aluminum, zinc, 
steel, fuel oil, and rubber; the exchange has never made a market in fluorite ore or provided fluorite 
ore price quotes


45
 


Limited  
Board of 
Directors 
Oversight  
of SHZ 
Management 


• On 11/02/07, SHZ adopted new corporate bylaws, which supposedly included Charters for new Audit, 
Compensation, and Corporate Governance Committees


46
 


• As per the Audit Charter, “The Committee will meet on a regular basis at least 4 times each year, and 
will hold special meetings as circumstances require;” however, despite an auditor change, significant 
CFO turnover, and a history of multiple SEC filing restatements: 


— The Audit Committee only met 2 times in 2008
47


 
— The Audit Committee only met 3 times in 2009


48
 


• As per the Compensation Charter, the Committee will have the responsibility and duty to “review 
annually and approve the Company’s compensation strategy;” however, despite adopting an Omnibus 
Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2009 and paying out cash compensation both years: 


— The Compensation Committee met ZERO times in 2008
47


 
— The Compensation Committee met ZERO times in 2009


48
 


• As per the Corporate Governance Charter, the Committee will meet whenever necessary to “identify 
and review candidates” for the Board of Directors; Mr. Konman Wong was appointed to the Board of 
Directors in July 2009 after the abrupt resignation of Mr. Feng Bai  


— The Corporate Governance Committee met ZERO times in 2008
47


 
— The Corporate Governance Committee met ZERO times in 2009


48
 


• Besides presenting an illusion of adequate internal controls and corporate governance, why did 
SHZ’s establish Board of Directors’ Committees if they rarely meet and have no effective control 
over SHZ Management?

9:  January 19, 2011 $20mm Equity Offering – No rational explanation 


based on business needs and increases the risk of corporate malfeasance 
Equity offerings are one of the prime ways investors’ cash is squandered.  Based on SHZ’s 09/30/10 balance 


sheet and Management’s guidance, the business should be generating copious amounts of free cash flow to 


be self-supporting and easily refinance its limited existing debt.  

















For SHZ’s January 19
, 
2011, $20mm equity offering, it is hard to decide if the 919,151 further dilutive 


warrants SHZ included in the deal, the 4.5% placement agent fees, or the 13.1% price-to-close discount was 


worse for existing shareholders.
52


  If Management is concerned about having liquidity on-hand for the closing 


of the cash portion of the Xinyi investment, wouldn’t debt financing be cheaper with SHIBOR rates 


approximately 1.8% and less dilutive for public shareholders?
53


  Based on the FY11 guidance, SHZ would have 


robust credit ratios even if the Xinyi acquisition was 100% debt funded.  Also, why did SHZ run an overnight 


offering without any investor roadshow if Management is confident in their future business prospects and 


FY11 financial guidance?  This equity offering is yet another example of SHZ Management’s actions speaking 


much louder than their words.   


Studying the Prospectus in detail also raises additional red flags.  SHZ originally filed a S-3 Preliminary 


Prospectus on 12/07/10 with a proposed offering size of $15mm and the Use of Proceeds was extremely 


broad.
54


  After SHZ’s stock price more than doubled from 12/07/10 when the People’s Republic of China 


allocation of rare earth industry quotas were released on  12/28/10, a revised S-3A was filed on 01/05/11, 


which increased the proposed offering size by 3.3x to $50mm and included no additional clarity on Use of 


Proceeds.
55


  Under the terms of this existing shelf-prospectus, SHZ could still issue an additional $30mm in 


new equity and further dilute public shareholders.   


FT Global Capital served as the sole placement agent on the offering for SHZ.  FT Global Capital’s 


headquarters is a $199/month Regus Virtual Office in suburban Atlanta, the firm only has two FINRA 


registered representatives (one of whom recently filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy), and the firm has a history 


of representing dubious issuers.
56


  Also, after reviewing the reported short-interest and borrow-availability 


around the time of the offering, Absaroka would not be surprised if some RegM/Rule105 violations occurred 


to assist in the transaction closing; it is a securities law violation for traders to sell-short a stock prior to a 


secondary public equity offering and then allow the same traders to buy-to-cover when the deal prices.

Valuation and Price Target Estimate 


$/Share Equity Value Based on 32.3mm Diluted Shares & $3.8mm Net Cash57 


Absaroka’s valuation calculations assume 32.3mm diluted shares outstanding and a current net cash 


position of $3.8mm; these figures are based on SHZ’s 09/30/10 10-Q SEC filing and have been adjusted 


for the January equity offering and Xinyi acquisition.  Because of the numerous concerns discussed 


earlier, Absaroka has zero confidence in SHZ’s forward-looking guidance and feels the better valuation 


metrics for SHZ are based on the reported historical financials.  First, as SHZ has acquired all its assets 


relatively recently, 1.0-1.5x Net PP&E is a fair assessment of SHZ’s value in a break-up liquidation 


scenario.  Next, because revenue multiples are hampered by a lack of correlation to actual free cash 


flow generation, 3-5x LTM revenue seems a bit generous based on similar trading valuations for SHZ’s 


comparable global mining peers.  Finally, as SHZ had both negative LTM EBITDA and LTM Net Income, 


Absaroka had to take an especially optimistic view for a positive valuation based on cash flow.
58





Annualizing SHZ’s 3Q10 (prime mining season in the Inner Mongolia region) EBITDA of $1.3mm and 


applying a rich 6-8x multiple for a commodity business implies a mid-point value of ~$1.25/share.   


Triangulating all the information discussed earlier in the report, the recent trading history, and 


reasonable valuation metrics, Absaroka is initiating coverage of China Shen Zhou Mining & Resources 


with a $1.25 price target and a CONVICTION SELL Recommendation. 


Whether or not you agree with this Price Target calculation methodology, Absaroka is confident the 


figures would receive a favorable audit opinion if subjected to review by SHZ’s auditors, Sherb & Co. or 


E-Fang Accountancy Corp.  Please review Appendix F for an example of the detail-focused work 


product provided by SHZ’s auditors.

 32.3mm shares outstanding is calculated based on 27,974,514 shares out as of 01/18/11, 2,836,883 issued on 01/19/11, and makes the simplifying assumption 
only 1,443,001 shares are issued for the closing of the Xinyi acquisition (Based on SHZ’s closing price as of $5.25 and heroically assuming the equity put-option is not 
exercised in the future); at this time, the 919,151 warrants outstanding are currently out-of-the-money.  $3.8mm net cash is calculated based on 09/30/10 
cash/equivalents of $1.5mm and debt of $10.8mm, equity offering proceeds, after placement agent fees and offering expenses, of $18.9mm, and Xinyi cash 
acquisition costs of $5.9mm. 
58


 Please note in 4Q09 SHZ benefited from a non-recurring, non-cash $14.0mm gain with the repurchase of its convertible note at a 50% discount to face value; this 
one-time gain has been excluded from Absaroka’s valuation calculations

Conclusion – China Shen Zhou Mining & 
Resources (AMEX: SHZ) 


To review, Absaroka’s due diligence has unearthed a plethora of serious concerns about the validity of 


China Shen Zhou Mining & Resources’ $169mm market capitalization, including: 


1. SHZ’s main product is fluorite (a.k.a fluorspar or CaF2):  Despite a common misconception in the 


market, fluorite is not a rare earth nor does SHZ have any exposure to the rare earths business 


2. Critical mines are significantly smaller than claimed by SHZ Management:  For example, its fluorite 


mine supposedly has a production capacity of >2x historical output and the Qingxing mine is 


allegedly 777.4km long, which would make it one of the world’s largest underground mines and 


violate the sovereignty  of Mongolia 


3. SHZ’s FY11 financial guidance cannot be reconciled with prior results and Management is making 


promises it cannot meet:  Even if SHZ is able to achieve its extremely aggressive production forecasts 


of >2x volume growth, the implied commodity prices are irrationally high based on revenue guidance 


4. The recent Xinyi Fluorite Company investment appears to be a fraudulent scheme to transfer equity 


to related parties and includes a put-option that is highly dilutive to public shareholders 


5. Significant CFO turnover, low quality auditors, and a dubious Audit Committee raises grave concern 


about the validity of published historical financials and forward-looking guidance:  2 of the auditors 


of the alleged China Education Alliance (NYSE: CEU) fraud have also signed off on SHZ’s financials 


6. Audit Committee Chairman and Independent Director Mr. Gene Michael Bennett appears to have a 


fabricated employment history, a non-existent CPA certification, overstated educational 


achievements, and has been a Board member for four other Chinese reverse-merger frauds  


7. Multiple material differences between Management statements and reality, including a 60% miss on 


FY09 fluorite production guidance, mysterious fluorite pricing data, and failed development projects 


8. The recent trading history was significantly impacted by the Company’s prolific and misleading 


investor relations effort while insiders were selling stock prior to the $20mm equity offering 


9. $20mm equity offering in January 2011 had no rational explanation based on business needs and 


significantly increases the risk of corporate malfeasance 


Any of these serious issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public shareholders to 


question the current $5.25/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” form of shareholder activism

China Shen Zhou Mining & Resources Frequently Asked Questions: 
 


But isn’t Citadel Investment Group an investor in SHZ? 


Citadel Investment Group, and its affiliates, currently holds no position in SHZ.  On 12/27/06, Citadel invested 


$28.0mm into SHZ via a 6.75% convertible senior note with a conversion price of $2.30/share; by 09/28/07, SHZ’s 


actual EBITDA was already in default of the note’s credit covenants.  On 09/22/09, SHZ repurchase the note for 


$8.0mm in cash and 5.0mm shares of SHZ common stock, which were trading at $0.93/share, which implies at 


least a 50% loss for Citadel. 





What could happen if Mr. Gene Michael Bennett resigns as SHZ’s Audit Committee Chairman and Director? 


Unfortunately for SHZ’s public shareholders, the resignation of a single Board of Directors member will not be 


enough to solve SHZ’s problems.  SHZ must file its 2010 10-K by 03/31/11 or it will be in violation of AMEX 


requirements and could be delisted.
59


  In order file a valid 10-K, SHZ must have a Director that is qualified under 


the requirements of SarbOx section 3(a)(58)(A) as an “audit committee financial expert” and is also considered 


“Independent” under SEC rules.  It may be difficult for SHZ to identify an appropriate candidate, perform due 


diligence on the candidate’s background, and bring the new Independent Director up to speed on the accounting 


systems and internal controls so they are comfortable opining on the validity of the FY10 results under this 


compressed timeframe.  





What could happen if Sherb & Co. is replaced with another auditor? 


Unfortunately for SHZ’s public shareholders, the resignation of Sherb & Co. will not be enough to solve SHZ’s 


problems.  In order to file a valid 10-K by the 03/31/11 deadline and not violate AMEX listing requirements, SHZ 


must have a PCAOB certified auditor provide a favorable audit opinion on its FY10 results prior to filing with the 


SEC.  At this stage in the calendar, it would be nearly impossible for a new audit firm to complete the due diligence 


review of SHZ’s accounting systems, certify the internal controls, and audit FY10 results by the 03/31/11 deadline.  


Moreover, a new auditor might need additional time to investigate some of the anomalies in the historical results 


identified in this report before it would be comfortable providing an audit opinion.  Finally, a detailed review of 


historical results by a new audit firm could result in the restatements of prior SEC filings. 





What do SHZ’s Chinese State Administration for Industry and Commerce financials show? 


For the limited years Absaroka’s in-country investigator was able to retrieve SHZ’s operating subsidiary SAIC 


financials, the de minimis revenue, operating losses, and negative cash flow reported in the historical SEC 


financials is somewhat similar to the SAIC results.  These figures support Absaroka’s thesis that SHZ is massively 


over-valued as its FY11 guidance does not reconcile with historical results and thus should not be relied upon. 





What are Absaroka’s next steps after the publication of this report? 


Absaroka intends to contact the PCAOB, SEC, and AMEX to share our findings and detailed back-up with the 


appropriate regulators.  As requested by the Dean of the University of Michigan Law School, we have shared SHZ’s 


contact information so he can send a cease-and-desist letter to Mr. Gene Michael Bennett.  Also, Absaroka plans to 


publish additional reports on SHZ as we learn any new and useful information.

Appendix A:  Corporate Overview – Sub-optimal reverse-merger listing history 


and numerous minority interest holders are positioned to siphon off cash 


SHZ Abbreviated Corporate History60 


 On 09/15/06, SHZ was formed by a share exchange/reverse takeover among 1) Earth Products & 


Technologies, Inc. (“EPTI”), a blank-check Nevada corporation with no ongoing business, 2) 


American Federal Mining Group, Inc. (“AFMG“), an Illinois company, and 3) the shareholders of 


AFMG, who are the core of SHZ’s current Management Team and the Board of Directors insiders  


 In the reverse-merger, the owners of AFMG were granted 20.0mm new shares (~94%) and the 


original EPTI shareholders kept 1.3 shares (~6%) of the outstanding common stock 


 American Eastern Securities, the originator of the reverse merger, was granted a 10% stake in 


the new company after the transaction closed; its stake in SHZ was liquidated by 10/06/10 


 Shares were originally traded on the OTC-BB and then listed on the AMEX on 01/31/08 


 On 09/13/11, SHZ announced a $13.5mm investment in Xinyi Fluorite Company Ltd. 


SHZ Simplified Corporate Structure61 
 





























While this onshore/offshore corporate structure is pretty standard in the reverse-merger space, the 


substantial number of individual shareholders with interests in the operating subsidiaries is cause for 


significant due diligence concern.  In China, a company’s partners or suppliers often turn out to be 


controlled or even owned by the company’s own managers and families, a practice that lends itself to 


“tunneling”—using outside businesses to milk the corporation at the expense of public shareholders.  


SHZ has enough “tunnels” into operating subsidiaries to capitalize many extended families and friends.

Appendix C:  SHZ FY11 Financial Guidance - Not possible to reconcile with prior 


results and SHZ appears to be making promises it cannot meet 
Utilizing some simple arithmetic, it becomes crystal clear that SHZ’s FY11 financial forecast cannot be relied upon, 


even if one makes the heroic assumption that SHZ is able to achieve its extremely aggressive production forecasts, 


despite the fatal mine flaws discussed in the prior sections.  Based on SHZ’s forecast production volumes and total 


revenue guidance, it is possible to back-solve for the implied fluorite price and compare it to third-party 


commodity pricing sources, like Industrial Minerals, to verify if SHZ Management assumptions are reasonable. 


First, because SHZ produces Zinc Concentrate and Copper Concentrate, not refined metals, it is necessary to take 


into account the significant concentrate transport, treatment, and refining discount to spot metal prices to 


accurately calculate SHZ’s actual revenue.  For the prior three years, Absaroka compared SHZ’s realized 


concentrate revenue to the spot metal price as quoted by the Shanghai Futures Exchange, which is the largest and 


most liquid metals commodity exchange in Asia.  Over this time period, SHZ’s realized concentrate revenue was 


approximately 40-49% of the spot metals pricing; this concentrate discount to spot metal pricing also seems 


reasonable if one assumes a ~15% Tcs/Rcs charge and adjusts for the significant transport cost of moving heavy 


and bulky concentrate from Inner Mongolia to the large Zn/Cu smelters located near the East China Sea.
63





Assuming concentrate pricing is 45% of the average 2011 forward metals curve as of 11/30/10 per the Shanghai 


Futures Exchange, and then back-solving for the implied SHZ fluorite VWAP shows Management expects pricing to 


increase 135.6% over its FY06-FY09 average realized price and 124.0% versus 3Q10; Industrial Minerals data shows 


Chinese Metallurgical Fluorspar pricing in 2011 has only increased 16.3% since 09/30/10.
64


  Also, even if one 


adjusts for the slightly higher current zinc and copper metal price curves versus 11/30/10, SHZ’s drastic forecasted 


fluorite pricing percentage increase is still not credible.  Finally, as discussed earlier, Absaraka has zero confidence 


in SHZ’s FY11 operational forecast to more than double total fluorite production and nonferrous concentrate 


production from prior reported results.
