We Are Short Shares of Cardtronics, Inc. (CATM) 


 Cardtronics is the world’s largest non-bank owner of ATMs with operations based 
primarily in US/UK 


 $1.5B market cap, $2.0B EV, $1B revenues1, $113mm reported EBIT1  


 Weak organic growth is masked by M&A, and return on capital is diminishing 


− Same-store transaction growth now ~0%; guidance repeatedly missed 


− Return on assets down 52% since 2010 (8.9% in 2010 to 4.3% in 2013) 


− Gross profit per unit on new and acquired ATMs is 41% lower than legacy ATMs2 


 Earnings appear inflated by shifting accounting standards 


− CATM’s 8-to-9-year assumed useful ATM life is well below peers of ~5 years 


− Policy has gotten more aggressive over time 


− Technological (e.g. Windows XP, EMV) and mechanical obsolescence is a real 
cash cost 


 ATMs are in secular decline globally, as evidenced by Fed and other third-party data 


 CATM’s largest customer, 7-Eleven, is a non-renewal risk in 2017 (~40% of earnings) 


 Kerrisdale estimates an equity fair value of $9 to $19, 40-70% downside

Business Model at a Glance 


 Owns 45k machines, operates 22k on behalf of merchants, and performs smaller 
subset of services for another 14k  


− CATM services 80,600 ATM machines in total 


 ATMs are typically located inside large retailers like 7-Eleven, CVS, and Walgreens 


− Revenue shared with merchants with terms defined in multi-year contracts 


 Main revenue sources: surcharge (46%, paid by user), interchange (34%, paid by 
user’s bank), branding and surcharge-free access fees (16%, paid by banks)1 


− Average revenue per withdrawal: $1.66 (many transactions surcharge-free) 


− CATM reports average withdrawals/ATM/month of ~724, while the typical 
domestic ATM generates 30-70% less volume2 


We believe there are a finite number of high-traffic locations, and CATM 
already owns many of them 


 As CATM moves further away from prime locations to achieve growth, 
returns on capital have fallen

Despite its Secular Challenges, CATM Trades at a Premium 


CATM equity has 41% downside to peer average 


 The best public comparable, Canadian competitor DirectCash, trades at ~8x EBITA. 
This multiple would imply a $15 share price for CATM (versus $32 current price) 


 Other companies with business models tied to paper-based payments also trade 
much lower:

Same-Store Cash Withdrawal Transactions at CATM’s Domestic ATMs: 
Year-over-Year Growth 


Same-store Transaction Growth Slowing to a Crawl 


What they said, 1Q13: 
“In the second quarter and throughout the 


remainder of 2013, we expect that [sic] 
our domestic same-store transaction 
growth to resume to a more normal 


range of 3-5%” 


…but subsequent growth fell below 
that range every single quarter! 


Source: CATM filings, Kerrisdale analysis
Page 6 


Illustrative DCF Shows Devastating Impact of Secular Decline 


Even very mild assumptions about long-term ATM usage 
point to a far lower stock price 


 We’ve modeled same-store transactions declining at a modest 1%/year 


− Likely very optimistic long-term, as Swedish precedent demonstrates1 


 Other assumptions: 


− Depreciation/maintenance capex based on 5.5-year average ATM life 


− Continued growth in organic ATM counts (3%/year) 


− Modest operating leverage (fixed ATM-level costs) drives slight margin 
compression 


− 8% WACC (note: high-yield debt issuer)  


 Results? 


− Fair value of ~$9 per share – 72% below the current stock price

CATM Quietly Changed Its Tune on Same-Store Growth 


What CATM said What happened 


1Q13: growth will rebound to 3-5% 2Q13-1Q14 growth averaged 1.6% 


2Q13: for remainder of year, growth 
“relatively consistent” with 2Q (2.7%) 


2H13 growth averaged 1.7% 
(37% lower than guidance) 


4Q13: “normal range of 3-5%”  
“moderate rate of increase” 1Q14: 0.4% growth 


1Q14: “moderate rate of increase”  
growth “still slightly below where we 


believe the rate will be for the remainder of 
2014” 


? 


Organic growth continues to surprise management to the downside  


 Same-store growth disclosures are buried within the 10-Qs and 10-Ks but 
rarely discussed in press releases or analyst reports
Page 9 


The Secular Decline in ATM Usage Has Already Begun 


 As non-cash payments (credit/debit card) and online commerce gain more and more 
share, paper currency becomes less useful 


− Logically, ATM withdrawals should eventually decline 


 Recent Federal Reserve data illustrates this trend: 


Source: 2013 Federal Reserve Payments Study, Kerrisdale analysis 


Declining ATM usage is a reality, not some far-off forecast

Page 10 


Long-term Viability Is a Major Concern for the Industry 


 2013 GAO survey of ATM operators: revenues falling primarily because of 
“declining transaction volumes” 
− 70% of respondents expect further revenue declines for same reason 


 2014 U.S. Independent ATM Deployer Survey (conducted by industry association 
and consultancy): biggest fear/worry/concern regarding health of industry? 


− #1 answer: “Declining Transactions” 
 45% of respondents, up from 36% in 2013 


− #2 answer: “ATM Saturation” 
 40% of respondents, up from 34% in 2013 


 CATM’s spin claims that “cash remains as relevant today as it was half a century 
ago” – but competitors’ attitudes tell a different story 


Other industry players are pessimistic about the future
Page 11 


ATMs Are Losing Value across the World 


 Piecing together the available international data: 


− Canada: withdrawals down since 2005, -3% CAGR  


− United Kingdom: withdrawals down 0.5% in 2013 


− Australia: withdrawals down 5% in 2013 


− Eurozone: withdrawals down since 2010, -0.4% CAGR 


− Sweden: approaching cashlessness 


 Cash in circulation has fallen every year since 2007 


Withdrawals down 30% from 2004 to 2011 


Withdrawals expected to decline an additional 6-8%/yr going forward 


 Will the United States and other developed countries really have less sophisticated 
payment systems than Sweden forever? 


The ATM decline is global – and just getting started

CATM: Free Cash Flow Net of Acquisitions, 2001-2013

 As CATM has resumed its acquisitions spree, its return on capital has declined by 
any measure: 

















 Based on company disclosures, we estimate that ATMs added after 2010 are 41% 
less profitable than legacy ATMs 
− Legacy ATMs: $376 gross profit per month 


− New/acquired ATMs: $280 


− Overall average dragged down with each new deal

Technology & Compliance Drive ATM Replacement… 


ATMs must be replaced routinely: 
wear & tear, rule changes, new technology…
Page 16 


…but CATM Continually Underestimates Capex… 


Year after year, CATM spends more on equipment than it expects 
despite slow/negative organic unit growth 


 Actual capex comes in above guidance every year 


− The 2014 guidance from 4Q13 was already revised upward in 1Q14 


Source: CATM filings, Kerrisdale analysis
Page 17 


…and Assumes Its Machines Last Longer & Longer  


 CATM says it depreciates P&E over 3 to 10 years – a wide range! 


 We estimate that the average assumed useful life has gone from ~7 years to ~9 
years: 

















 
 Consistent with little-noticed language change in 10-Ks:

− 2010: “three to eight years” 
− 2012: “three to ten years”

CATM’s Largest Customer Is at Risk 


Even if CATM retains the 7-Eleven relationship, the competitive 
pressure could result in less favorable terms and lower earnings 


 7-Eleven accounts for 24% of CATM’s revenues 


 The chain is owned by a Japanese firm, Seven & i 


− Seven & i owns ~half of Seven Bank, the company that owns and operates 
all the ATMs in Japanese 7-Eleven stores 


− Seven Bank entered the US ATM market with two acquisitions: one in 2012 and 
another in 2013 


− Seven Bank management is openly seeking the US 7-Eleven contract: 


 “Seven Bank will work hard to ensure that 7-Eleven and its customers 
choose [our] ATMs when [Cardtronics] negotiates a contract extension”1 


 “[W]e intend to roll out a wide-ranging scheme for further expansion”2 


 CATM’s current contract with 7-Eleven expires in mid-2017 


− The threat from Seven Bank gives 7-Eleven a strong bargaining position

7-Eleven Exposure Is Larger than the Market Appreciates 


7-Eleven’s high-traffic ATMs are disproportionately profitable, 
exacerbating CATM’s concentration risk 


 7-Eleven accounts for 24% of CATM’s revenues – widely cited statistic 


 However, we estimate that 7-Eleven ATMs generate ~2x as much revenue per unit 
as CATM’s average ATM and thus 41% of total earnings:

Conclusion 


 CATM faces sharply slowing same-store transaction growth 


− Management has repeatedly underestimated this trend 


 Overall ATM usage faces broad declines across the world 


 Aggressively drawn-out depreciation has inflated earnings 


− But cash capex keeps surprising to the upside 


 Roll-up strategy papers over these issues but leads to declining returns 


− Lower gross profits per ATM, lower returns on capital 


 Peer valuations and illustrative DCF point to $9-19 fair value, 40-70% lower 


 None of these concerns turn on the 7-Eleven contract… 


− But CATM also risks losing ~25% of revenue/~40% of earnings because of it 


− Long-term presence of Seven Bank in US market will put ongoing competitive 
pressure on CATM’s margins
