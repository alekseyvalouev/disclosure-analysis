Rate (Or Death) Spirals, As Defined By Wikipedia:

TRUP


I have long wondered if TRUP is under-pricing its business, and it seems that I'm
not the only one.


The term "rate spiral" depicts the never-ending losses and subsequent price raises
that are a result of an insurance book being underpriced. It can be terminal.


The Obamacare exchanges are an example of adverse selection that caused rates
to spiral higher and higher. Even the federal government's attempt to backstop
didn't work.


A former employee recently weighed in on TRUP's premium raises, and it's not
encouraging.

FOIAs Indicate That Trupanion Has Underpriced Its Business


Hypothetically:


Death spiral is a condition of the insurance market in which costs rapidly increase as a
result of changes in the covered population. It is the result of adverse selection in
insurance policies in which lower risk policy holders choose to change policies or be
uninsured. The term is found in the academic literature at least as early as Cutler and
Zeckhauser's 1998 paper, "Adverse Selection in Health Insurance", which refers
explicitly to an "adverse selection death spiral".[1]


A significant concern of mine has been the size of the price increases that Trupanion
(NASDAQ:TRUP) has requested over the past several years. This is not an exhaustive
list - it's just what I have been able to pull together over the past few weeks.


Source: State Files and FOIA Requests


Price hikes are concerning because outsized rate increases from insurance providers
can signal that they have historically underpriced the risk in their book of business.
These rate increases are sufficient in frequency and magnitude to begin a campaign of
submitting FOIA requests for customer complaints to state insurance commissions.
Investors in TRUP have to be hyper-vigilant about rates because TRUP has a sales
channel that is prone to adverse selection, much like the Obamacare exchanges, they
sell to previously uninsured patients, and do so at the veterinarian hospital itself.


Regulators are particularly sensitive to "rate spirals" because the dynamic can play out
in a predatory spiral whereby the consumer is left with no choice but to lose coverage or
pay up.

Why Do I Think This Is A Risk?


An insurance company underprices its insurance to gain market share in the pet
insurance market.


1.


Unsuspecting patients sign up for the artificially low insurance product to save a few
dollars.


2.


The insurance company then aggressively raises the rates of the insurance that they
initially underpriced, and the patient is trapped because other insurance offerings
won't cover pre-existing conditions that have developed under the initial carrier's
watch.


3.


The consumer is left with the choice not to have coverage or pay whatever rate the
carrier demands.


4.

Kahn.

company requests greater and greater increases in their premiums.
