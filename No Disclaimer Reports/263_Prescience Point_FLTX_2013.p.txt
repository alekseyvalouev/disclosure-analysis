We believe shares of Fleetmatics Group PLC (“the company”, or “FLTX”) are grossly overvalued, reflecting few, if any, of the serious risks that 


warrant questioning the credibility of the company’s financial statements. In this report, we discuss the company’s use of various accounting 


shenanigans that inflate profitability, the material weaknesses in its internal controls, the inexplicable discrepancies between related 


accounts in its financials, and Fleetmatics’ founding backer’s ties to a previous accounting fraud. According to our analysis, Fleetmatics’ 


2012 gross margin was inflated by 400bp and reported Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS were overstated by 27% and 33%, respectively. 


Going forward, we believe the company faces many headwinds, with its vehicle churn rate set to continue accelerating in 2H’13 and beyond; 


as churn picks up, FLTX is forced to accelerate its deferred costs, potentially resulting in both a revenue and a margin contraction problem, at 


the same time. We believe the company has presented itself to the investing public in a highly questionable manner and that, as a result, it 


has been successful in its efforts to inflate its stock price beyond any reasonable measure of valuation, enabling its insiders to cash out big 


before the cards come tumbling down. Based on our analysis, Fleetmatics’ stock has an intrinsic value of 


~$11-$12 per share, ~75% below current trading levels.

Fleetmatics | FLTX 
Recommendation: Strong Sell 


September 19, 2013 


Well Diversified Balance of Accounting/Non-Accounting Red Flags is Concerning 


 Use of Aggressive Accounting Policies Inflates its Financials: Uses several aggressive accounting policy levers in unison to 


inflate profitability. It appears Fleetmatics’ 2012 gross margin was inflated by 400bp and reported Adjusted EBITDA and 


Adjusted EPS were overstated by 27% and 33%, respectively  


 It Reports a Deflated Churn Rate: Management-disclosed gross churn rate of 8-9% is distortive because of how the 


business is structured. We estimate true gross churn is 20-25% via the appropriate cohort-based approach 


 It Exaggerates its Market Opportunity: We believe FLTX’s global market opportunity is a tiny fraction of its claim 


 Its Insiders Ran for the Exits: We do not believe we have ever witnessed such a quick dash for the exit.  Insiders sold 


~$760m of FLTX stock, their entire stake, in 4 public offerings in less than 1 year. The most recent secondary was 


transacted less than 2 months following the previous.  


 Hints of Dishonesty: FLTX boasted its first ever FCF+ quarters in Q1 and Q2’13, just ahead of announcements for 2 


secondaries. FCF was boosted by unexpected increases in deferred revenue balance as FLTX offered discounts in  


exchange for contract pre-pays, an action it previously guided the Street would stop 


 Something to Hide?: Businessman Bill McCabe – FLTX founding shareholder, and former board member & consultant – is  


tied to frauds that occurred at a previous company he founded. He worked with FLTX through 2012; His entity’s contract  


with FLTX was prematurely terminated on 8/20/2012, only 2 weeks prior to FLTX’s 10/5/2012 IPO 


How We Expect the Dominoes To Fall 


 FLTX locks new customers into 3-year non-cancellable contracts and capitalizes & depreciates in-vehicle device and sales 


commission costs over a 6 year period. This mismatch results in artificially inflated GMs over the 3 year contract period 


 If vehicle churn were to rise as a % of FLTX’s entire vehicle base, and it has been, and revenue growth slowed, which we 


anticipate, the chickens come home to roost. When customers churn off after the 3 year contract term, FLTX is forced to  


write down the entirety of what remains of the capitalized costs – the remaining 3 years’ worth.  The negative effects from 


the write downs begin to outweigh the margin benefits from signing new customers, resulting in deflated margins 


 FLTX’s reported gross churn rate rose from 6.7% to 8.4% in the 4 quarters from Q2’2012 to Q3’2013. Increasingly larger 


numbers of its customer contracts are beginning to expire relative to the size of its base 


Founding Shareholder Tied to Previous Accounting Fraud 


 FLTX was originally backed by Oyster Capital, the private investment entity of Irish businessman Bill McCabe. He had 


previously founded and served as CEO & Chairman of SmartForce PLC, an e-learning company that twice settled on 


charges alleging fraud. The lawsuits claimed that SmartForce capitalized expenses that dramatically inflated its financial 


results, backdated revenues, improperly booked revenues from multi-year contracts, and issued materially misleading 


statements to illicit gains from sales of stocks. 


Fleetmatics equity is overvalued on almost every metric and from all perspectives 


 We believe FLTX is priced for perfection, in light of our assessment of its fundamentals, trading at ~9.5x and 30x 2013E 


revenue and reported Adj. EBITDA, respectively. Adjusting FLTX’s financial statements for aggressive accounting policies, 


it is selling at true 37x 2013E EBITDA  


 Recent IPO of MiX Telematics (NYSE MIXT), a superior operating/financial model, trades at a substantial discount, further 


highlighting FLTX’s extreme valuation disconnect 


 Fleetmatics’  is incorrectly positioned as a SaaS company, and not with other mobile asset tracking and GPS service 


comps that trade at approximately 2.0x and 12.5x 2013E revenue and EBITDA, respectively; a plethora of recent M&A 


deals in the sector also warrant dramatically lower average multiples – 2.6x and 9.1x LTM revenue and EBITDA

Executive Summary 
 


We believe shares of Fleetmatics Group PLC (“the company”, or “FLTX”) are grossly overvalued, reflecting few, if any, of the serious risks 


that warrant questioning the credibility of the company’s financial statements. In this report, we discuss the company’s use of various 


accounting shenanigans that inflate profitability, the material weaknesses in its internal controls, the inexplicable discrepancies between 


related accounts in its financials, and Fleetmatics’ founding backer’s ties to a previous accounting fraud. According to our analysis, 


Fleetmatics’ 2012 gross margin was inflated by 400bps and reported Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS were overstated by 27% and 33%, 


respectively. We believe the company faces many headwinds, with its vehicle churn rate set to continue accelerating in 2H’13 and beyond; 


as churn picks up, FLTX is forced to accelerate its deferred costs, potentially resulting in both a revenue and a margin contraction problem, 


at the same time. 





We believe the company has presented itself to the investing public in a highly questionable manner and that, as a result, it has been 


successful in its efforts to inflate its stock price beyond any reasonable measure of valuation, enabling its insiders to cash out big before 


the cards come tumbling down. Based on our analysis, Fleetmatics’ stock has an intrinsic value today of ~$11 per share, ~75% below 


current trading levels. 





Accounting shenanigans distort Fleetmatics’ true economics – FLTX appears to be inflating its GAAP and non-GAAP financial metrics 


with an aggressive cost capitalization strategy that results in a highly misleading reflection of its business model and economics, and that 


render its reported financials ineffective toward evaluating its business. Several accounting policy levers pulled in unison have enabled 


the company to report inflated reported Gross Margins, Adjusted EBITDA, EPS, and Operating Cash Flow.  We also believe FLTX’s 


reported vehicle churn rate is set to continue increasing in the back half of this year, resulting in the unwinding of financial statement 


benefits previously reaped through aggressive accounting policies (i.e. contracting revenue growth and, coincidentally, contracting 


margins).  





FLTX’s original backer and long-time board member is tied to a fraud perpetuated by his former company Smartforce PLC – FLTX was 


originally backed by Oyster Capital, the private investment entity of Irish businessman Bill McCabe. Mr. McCabe had previously founded 


and served as CEO & Chairman of SmartForce PLC an e-learning company that twice settled on charges alleging fraud. The lawsuits 


claimed that SmartForce capitalized expenses that dramatically inflated its financial results, backdated revenues, improperly booked 


revenues from multi-year contracts, and issued materially misleading statements to illicit gains from sales of stocks.  





Mr. McCabe sold his FLTX stake to a private equity group and resigned from its board in 2010, but would continue his involvement with 


the company through 2012 via an opaquely structured Management Services Agreement executed by and between FLTX and a separate 


entity affiliated with him. This agreement was structured to terminate in 2014, but was prematurely terminated on August 20, 2012, 


immediately preceding FLTX’s October 5, 2012 IPO; the timing indicates Fleetmatics sought to distance itself from McCabe so as not to 


draw the kind of scrutiny it might have drawn were he still associated with the company. Regardless, Fleetmatics’ severing of ties with 


him immediately ahead of its IPO appears suspicious and begs the question: Is there anything to hide? 





Beyond our study of the legal suits brought against him, we are neither certain as to how hands-on Mr. McCabe was in perpetuating any 


wrongdoing alleged upon him, nor have we formed any opinion; in light of the numerous allegations of accounting frauds committed, his 


close association with Fleetmatics since its very beginnings, and FLTX’s choice to adopt aggressive accounting measures that obfuscate 


its profitability, we must acknowledge our belief that FLTX has an elevated risk profile.   





oaterial weaknesses in internal controls leave open the door for frauds and improprieties – Based on experience from having been at 


the forefront of exposing scores of fraudulent, US-listed Chinese reverse-mergers, weaknesses in internal controls are amongst the most 


glaring warning signs in public companies; they leave the door wide open for frauds and other improprieties to be committed. 


Fleetmatics’ deficiencies are significant enough to have necessitated the restatement of certain 2011 and 2012 statements of cash flows 


and to have been highlighted as one of the company’s highest risk factors, something we find atypical. Further, we have identified 


significant inconsistencies between the company’s PP&E and capital expenditure accounts. We are not certain of why the discrepancies 


exist, but in light of the company’s choice to adopt aggressive accounting measures that obfuscate its profitability, we must acknowledge 


the risk of an attempt to artificially boost EPS.

Beyond the pitch – Management’s investor pitch is in part centered on the claim of a $30 billion global market potential for fleet 


tracking solutions in the small and medium business (SMB) market; they also point to very low levels of current penetration for fleet 


telematics solutions, implying sustainability in the company’s growth trajectory. These numbers provide little informational value toward 


understanding FLTX’s prospects. The market penetration of fleet telematics services amongst SMBs is low for a reason, and it is likely to 


remain so: FLTX’s primary end market of SMBs operates on thin margins, with high business failure rates, and low technology adoption 


rates. The results of a survey published by Automotive Fleet magazine indicate that of SMBs with less than 100 vehicles in their fleets, 


80% are not considering telematics and only 15.7% who aren’t current users are considering telematics.  And FLTX faces a high risk of 


failure due to an intensifying competitive landscape characterized by low barriers to entry, limited product differentiation, and 


intensifying price pressure. FLTX’s key hardware and network suppliers are now directly competing against the company. 





oanagement’s reported gross churn metric is distortive and understates true churn – In the first two quarters of 2013, Fleetmatics 


reported an annualized gross churn rate of 8-9%. They use an ‘aggregate gross churn rate’ calculation, which for a fast-growing 


aggregate customer base, like FLTX’s, will understate the true churn rate compared to a cohort based approach to the calculation. Using 


the cohort approach we estimate the FLTX’s ‘true’ gross churn to be 20-25%, indicating management’s figure understates the churn rate 


by >50%. 20-25% gross churn seems far more appropriate than the reported figure for a company whose primary end market consists of 


SMBs.  Our calculation implies FLTX’s average customer life is 4-5 years, as opposed to the company’s claim of a 6 year average customer 


life.  Our 4-5 year customer life estimate also matches up with that claimed by FLTX’s closest comparable MiX Telematics (MIXT), a pure-


play fleet telematics company.  





Churn set to acellerate, and Revenue Growth to Slow in 2H’2013 


FLTX’s reported gross churn rate rose from 6.7% to 8.4% in the 4 quarters from Q2’2012 to Q3’2013. We expect its reported gross churn 
rate to continue accelerating in 2H’13 as increasingly larger numbers of its customer contracts begin to expire relative to the size of its 
vehicle base. If vehicle churn were to increase as a percentage of FLTX’s entire vehicle base without an accompanying acceleration in 
revenue growth (as we discuss in the sections that follow), the dodgy accounting that may have facilitated FLTX’s easy VC exit comes 
back to haunt, as the negative effects from the capitalized cost write downs begin to outweigh the margin benefits from signing new 
customers: The benefits previously realized from these policies come unwound, resulting in a disproportionately negative impact on 
profitability, or deflated margins.  


FLTX is overvalued, and on almost every metric – FLTX has gone to great lengths to dress up a capital-intense software company with 


low entry barriers as a high margin SaaS company. Sell-side analysts have obliged, with a consensus stock price target of $44.75 based 


on premium multiples. Regardless, FLTX’s stock price has blown through the consensus target, currently trading in the $46 - $48 per 


share range, and appears on the surface to be very richly valued, trading at 9.5x and 30x 2013E revenue and reported Adj. EBITDA, 


respectively; but, because FLTX is aggressive in its use of cost capitalization accounting, its reported Adj. EBITDA calculation does not 


reflect the true costs of its business, meaning that its stock’s nosebleed 30x EBITDA valuation is understated relative to its economic 


reality.  By adjusting FLTX’s financial statements for its aggressive accounting policies, we calculate that FLTX is selling at true 37x 2013E 


EBITDA… truly preposterous.  Fleetmatics’ comparables in the mobile asset tracking and GPS services markets trade at approximately 


2.0x and 12.5x 2013E revenue and EBITDA, respectively – much lower valuations; a plethora of recent private deals in the sector also 


warrant dramatically lower average multiples – 2.6x and 9.1x LTM revenue and EBITDA, respectively. 





Follow the money! Insiders cashing out – The truth is between the lines. FLTX’s equity appears inflated beyond reasonable measure, 


explaining why its largest shareholder and management team have rushed to liquidate their holdings at prices ranging from $17 and $46 


per share in 3 secondary offerings all having taken place in less than a year (January, July and September, 2013). In less than one years’ 


time, the company’s largest shareholder has liquidated $760m worth of shares, reducing its equity ownership to just 1.6% from 94.6% 


pre-IPO. Management has sold shares alongside its anchor shareholder, collectively reducing their ownership from 6.3% at IPO to 4.2%.  


The mirage of FLTX’s reported gross margin, EBITDA, and EPS, has existed for long enough to keep the stock price levitated and for 


insiders to dump their holdings at inflated prices, leaving shareholders holding the bag just as the business appears to be peaking.  





We have heeded the signal from insiders’ departure and have connected the dots for shareholders. We are short share of FLTX.

Lipstick on a Pig: Accounting Shenanigans Obfuscate FLTX’s True Economics 
 
Fleetmatics has adopted an aggressive cost capitalization strategy that we believe results in a misleading portrayal of its true economics, 
rendering its reported financial statements useless toward evaluating its business.  Based on our analysis, the company’s reported Gross 
Margins, reported Adjusted EBITDA, and EPS are all significantly inflated: For example, 2012 gross margin was inflated by 400 basis 
points and reported Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS were overstated by 27% and 33%, respectively. 1  The table below contains the 
summation of all our adjustments to Fleetmatics’ financial statements, each of which we detail in the sections that follow. 
 





                                                           
1 Fleetmatics defines Adjusted EBITDA as follows: net income (loss) plus provision for income taxes; interest (income) expense, net; foreign currency transaction (gain) 
loss, net; depreciation and amortization of property and equipment; amortization of capitalized in-vehicle devices owned by customers; amortization of intangible assets; 
share-based compensation; and other items as defined in “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.”

Profitability Manipulation Shenanigan: Capitalizing Normal Operating Expenses  
 
Fleetmatics aggressively capitalizes and defers its sales commission costs over a 6 year period, which inflates its EBITDA and profit 
margins.  As a result of this policy in isolation, we estimate the company was able to inflate 2012 Adjusted EBITDA by 7% and Adjusted 
EPS by 8%. 
 
FLTX’s relevant accounting policy, along with its justification for using it, follows: 
 


We capitalize commission costs that are incremental and directly related to the acquisition of customer contracts. We pay 
commissions in full when we receive the initial customer payment for a new subscription or a renewal subscription. Commission 
costs are capitalized upon payment and are amortized as expense ratably over the term of the related non-cancelable customer 
contract in proportion to the recognition of the subscription revenue. If a subscription agreement is terminated, the 
unamortized portion of any deferred commission costs is recognized as expense immediately. 
….. 
We believe that capitalizing commission costs is the preferable method of accounting as the commission charges are so closely 
related to the revenue from the non-cancelable customer contracts that they should be recorded as an asset and charged to 
expense over the same period that the subscription revenue is recognized. 
 


The capitalization of normal, recurring operating expenses is overtly aggressive, and the vast majority of SaaS companies do not do it, 


instead expensing their sales commission costs (Appendix I).  Furthermore, as we discuss in the next section, FLTX is a young company 


that has a limited and incomplete basis to claim a 6 year average customer life, and that management’s assumption here is self-serving 


to enhance its financial results.  


In the table below, by expensing the full cost of same-period commission costs we isolate the degree to which this policy alone serves to 


inflate its profitability metrics. In 2012, the company incurred $6.8m in commission costs and expensed $4.7m, and in doing so, skirted 


running ~30% of its 2012 commission costs through the income statement and Adjusted EBITDA calculation. Based on our analysis, this 


practice alone resulted in the overstatement of Fleetmatics’ reported 2012 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS by 7% and 8%, 


respectively.

Profitability Manipulation Shenanigan: Amortizing Costs Too Slowly  
 


Fleetmatics also capitalizes and defers the costs of the devices it installs in customers’ vehicles using an unjustifiably long 6 year 
depreciation period. This inflates its gross, EBITDA, and profit margins and obfuscates the true economics of its own business. Per its 
filings, 
 


We capitalize the cost of installed in-vehicle devices (including installation and shipping costs related to these devices) and 


depreciate these costs over the estimated useful life of the devices, which is currently six years, or over the estimated average 


customer relationship period, which is currently six years. If a customer subscription agreement is canceled or expires prior to 


the end of the expected useful life of the device under contract, the depreciation period is accelerated resulting in the carrying 


value being expensed in the then-current period. Should an installed in-vehicle device require replacement because it has 


become defective, we record as expense the cost of the replacement part or device when provided. 


 
The aggressiveness of Fleetmatics’ decision to capitalize rather than expense, in this case, is debatable.  Because the devices are never 
taken back at contract cancellation/ expiration, one could argue a sale has taken place upon installation and, hence, that these costs 
should be expensed. Some comparables offering analogous devices expense the entire device cost upon installation, and some do not. 
For example, LoJack Corp, a competitor in the fleet tracking industry, expenses the costs of its devices immediately upon installation as 
a cost of revenue; Sirius XM Satellite Radio expenses the cost of its in-vehicle devices.  MiX Telecom (MIXT), a pure-play fleet telematics 
company and its closest publicly trade comparable, on the other hand, capitalizes similar costs.  
 


What we find far more clear-cut is that FLTX’s choice to adopt a 6 year depreciation schedule is egregious and founded on a baseless 


assertion, that its average customer life is 6 years. This is not in line with its own history, is more aggressive than the policy adopted by 


its closest comp, cannot be justified in light of FLTX’s maturity as a company, and is out of line with our estimate of FLTX’s ‘true’ churn 


rate.  





1. Its History:  Fleetmatics itself assumed a 4 year, instead of 6 year, depreciable life for its in-vehicle devices prior to 2009. In a 


pre-IPO SEC comment letter, the company attempted to justify the increase from 4 to 6 by noting “technological 


improvements” that extended its device useful life. The portion of the SEC question follows: 





SEC: You disclose that you capitalize the cost of installed in-vehicle devices and depreciate these costs over the 


estimated useful life of six years. Your table on page F-9 indicates that you depreciate these costs over four to six years. 


Please reconcile this difference. 


RESPONSE: The Company supplementally advises the Staff that, as disclosed on page 49, the estimated useful life of in-
vehicle devices currently purchased and installed is six years. That estimated useful life was reassessed in early 2009 
based on technological improvements then made to the device, which management believed extended the estimated 
useful life of the newer device from four years to six years. Consequently, as of January 1, 2009, the Company began to 
depreciate newly purchased and installed in-vehicle devices over six years. However, the Company continued to 
depreciate in-vehicle devices purchased and installed prior to January 1, 2009 over their estimated useful life of four 
years. Those four-year assets are nearly fully depreciated at this time… 





2. Its Closest Comp:  MiX Telematics (MIXT), FLTX’s closest public comp and a fleet telematics pure-play, depreciates its in-vehicle 


device costs over a 3 - 5 year period, which is supportive of our concern that FLTX’s 6 year depreciation period is aggressive.   





3. Lack of Justifiability: FLTX appears to have no basis for assuming a 6 year average customer life. The company was only formed 


in 2004 and thus has an operating history of less than 9 years.  While it has grown to have 388,000 vehicles under subscription, 


at the end of 2005, it had only 9,000 vehicles under subscription.  The only annual vehicle subscription cohorts with a 6-yr 


potential life would be those from 2005 which represent less than 3% of the current total – hardly an adequate or 


representative sample set to claim that an “average” customer life is 6 years.  MIXT, on the other hand, has a 17 year business 


history, and like FLTX structures contracts with a 3 year subscription plan. MIXT’s device depreciation period of 3 - 5 years 


appears to support our concern that FLTX’s 6 year depreciation period is aggressive.  MIXT’s primary end market, enterprises, is

www.presciencepoint.com 
10 


far more stable than FLTX’s primary end market of SMBs. SMB failure rates are notoriously high, further demonstrating FLTX’s 


assumed 6-yr depreciation schedule is extremely liberal.  





4. Out of Line With Our Estimate of FLTX’s True Churn:  As we discuss later in the report, we estimate FLTX’s churn rate to be 20-


25%, vs. the 8-9% churn rate touted by management. Our calculation implies an average customer life of 4-5 years, which 


matches MiX Telematics depreciable life assumption and is in line with the depreciable life FLTX assumed prior to selling sock 


to the public.  





We believe a 4 year depreciable life assumption is more justifiable and reflective of FLTX’s reality than the apparently baseless 6 year 


assumption management has elected to use.  In the table below, by reducing FLTX’s depreciable life assumption from 6 years to 4 years, 


we isolate the degree to which FLTX’s aggressive and apparently unrealistic depreciable life assumption has artificially boosted the 


company’s profitability.  Based on our estimates,  





 FLTX is understating its in-vehicle device depreciation expense by ~50% annually  


 This practice alone resulted Fleetmatics’ reported 2012 Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EPS being overstated by 18% and 21%, 


respectively. 








The Textbook for Getting Rich (and then Losing it All) 
 


We should note that the aggressively slow depreciation of device costs over a 6 year period has likely been the primary driver of the 


dramatic rise in FLTX’s gross margins, which have risen from 64.5% in 2010 to 74% in the LTM period, although management would 


never reveal this. The company’s gross margin is so high at this point that FLTX has become somewhat of an outlier relative to its SaaS 


comps set.
www.presciencepoint.com 
11 








Management claims the company’s gross margin expansion resulted from revenue growth and cost efficiencies, driven by leveraging its 


scale to negotiate improved pricing on third-party costs coupled with improved economies of scale for certain infrastructure costs, such 


as hosting costs and internal configuration personnel costs.  These factors probably did play some role, at least a small one. 


FLTX’s outlier status suggests there’s more behind its gross margin story. We strongly believe it’s all about the accounting!  For 
accounting purposes, FLTX assumes an average customer life of 6 years. When a new customer signs up for its services, however, they 
are bound by a 3 year non-cancellable contract, resulting in a mismatch between the depreciable period and contractual term.  FLTX 
depreciates the cost of capitalized in-vehicle devices and sales commissions over the 6 year customer life assumption.  The significant 
mismatch coincides with an artificially inflated gross margin over the 3 year contract period, resulting in an inflated reported gross 
margin. 


That is how it works if a company, as FLTX has been, is in an accelerating growth phase. But, once revenue growth slows, the chickens 
come home to roost. FLTX is forced to write down capitalized device costs and sales commission costs immediately if customers don’t 
renew at contract expiry.  So, for example, if a customer signs up for 3 years, FLTX capitalizes and defers the sales and in-vehicle device 
costs over a stretched out 6 year period, enjoying high gross margins over the contract period; but, if the customer chooses not to 
renew at the end of the 3 year term, FLTX is forced to write down the entirety of what remains of the capitalized costs – the remaining 3 
years’ worth.   


If vehicle churn were to increase as a percentage of FLTX’s entire vehicle base without an accompanying acceleration in revenue 
growth, suddenly the dodgy accounting that may have facilitated an easy VC exit comes back to haunt, as the negative effects from the 
write downs begin to outweigh the margin benefits from signing new customers: The benefits previously realized from these policies 
come unwound, resulting in a disproportionately negative impact on profitability, or deflated margins.

Churn Set to Rise and Revenue Growth to Slow in 2H’2013 
 


Fleetmatics appears to be pulling as many accounting levers as possible, but the resulting financial benefits reaped are likely to begin 


unwinding as its revenue growth rate slows in 2H’2013: 


 Based on our analysis, Fleetmatics’ reported vehicle churn metrics significantly understate its true churn / overstate average 


customer life  


 We believe churn will continue rising into the back half of 2013 and beyond, resulting in a growing drag on revenue growth 


and contracting margins 


 The competitive landscape is steadily intensifying, resulting in intensified pricing pressures  





Fleetmatics’ Reported Churn Understates its True Churn (Who’d Have Thought!)  
 
We estimate Fleetmatics’ reported gross churn figures understate the company’s ‘true’ gross churn by >50%; our calculation of FLTX’s 


true churn indicates that its average customer life is 4-5 years, whereas FLTX claims a 6 year average customer life. 





In Q1’ and Q2’2013, FLTX reported annualized gross churn rates of 8.8% and 8.4%, respectively; but closer analysis reveals that these 


rates dramatically understate its true gross churn rate. Since FLTX acquired the lion share of its customers in the last 3 years and since it 


locks each new customer into a 3-year non-cancelable agreement, the majority of the company’s customers are not eligible to churn off.  


Given that the majority of FLTX’s customer base consists of customers serving out their initial 3-year contracts, we assume that the vast 


majority of FLTX’s churn results from customers who choose to churn off after having met the initial 3 year obligation (as opposed to 


customers who have used the company’s services for years and are bound by rolling 1 year contracts).  As such, management’s gross 
churn number essentially compares vehicles churned off from the small base of new customers signed up 3 years ago against the 


relatively enormous denominator of the company’s entire vehicle base; over the past few years, the company has invested significantly, 


at the expense of cash flowing, to accelerate customer acquisition growth, fattening the vehicle base. This has kept the reported churn 


rate low due to an ever-increasing denominator. The disclosed gross churn rate is really a comparison of ‘apples to oranges.’
www.presciencepoint.com 
13 


Looking at the churn rate for a fast-growing aggregate vehicle base will understate the true churn rate compared to a cohort based 


approach to the calculation. The cohort based approach also enables investors to calculate the company’s true survival rate and average 


customer life, whereas the aggregate approach that management uses cannot be used to reliably calculate these two metrics.  





So FLTX’s ‘true’ gross churn should be calculated by matching the population of vehicles that actually do cancel to the original population 


of vehicles that are eligible to cancel. Because FLTX locks each new customers into 3-year non-cancelable agreements, churn should be 


calculated on a 3 year lag basis. 





We assume the vast majority of cancellations come from customers who have satisfied the initial 3-year contractual term and estimate 


the company’s ‘true’ gross churn to be 20-25%, indicating management’s figure understates the churn rate by >50%. 20-25% gross churn 


seems far more appropriate a figure given FLTX primary SMB end market. Our calculation implies an average customer life of 4-5 years, 


as opposed to the company’s claim of a 6 year average customer life.  





Churn Set to Rise, Weighing on Revenue Growth & Contracting Margins 
 


FLTX reported its gross churn rate to have risen from 6.7% to 8.4% in the 4 quarters from Q2’2012 to Q3’2013. We expect its reported 


gross churn rate to continue accelerating in 2H’13 as increasingly larger numbers of its customer contracts begin to expire relative to 


growth in its base. Churn generally increases with the size of a customer base, becoming increasingly difficult to overcome, especially as 


the ability to accelerate revenue growth becomes increasingly more difficult. As churn picks up, FLTX is forced to accelerate its deferred 


costs, resulting in both a revenue and a margin contraction problem, at the same time. We believe this, at least in part, explains why its 


venture partners are rushing to cash out.   


The table below is a simplification meant only to demonstrate why churn would be expected to continue accelerating as increasingly 


larger numbers of customer contracts expire relative to growth in the vehicle base.  The below numbers do not represent with precision 


Fleetmatics’ reality because they inherently assume that if customers choose to renew at the end of the initial 3 year contractual term, 


that they would be locked into another 3 year contract. Fleetmatics’ policy does not work in this manner; when customers renew their 


contracts after the initial 3 year period, they are subsequently locked in for 1 year intervals.  Regardless, it conveys very well the 


challenge Fleetmatics is up against.  





Further increases in churn will disproportionately hurt FLTX. Rising churn rates counterbalance revenue growth while, coincidentally, the 


same liberal accounting policies that inflated FLTX’s profitability during the accelerating growth phase begin reversing, deflating the 


company’s profitability. Because FLTX must write down capitalized device and sales commission costs when customers don’t renew at 


contract expiry, in a rising churn rate environment, the negative effects of write downs are likely to outweigh the margin benefits from 


signing new customers. 





Intensifying Competitive Landscape & Emergence of Pricing Pressures 
 


Browsing the search engines for “fleet telematics” or “fleet tracking” companies yields dozens of companies trying to position 


themselves as a total solution provider for small, medium and large sized fleets. At its core, fleet telematics involves nothing more than a 


tracking device installed in a vehicle and a web-based application that allows companies to monitor and measure vehicle performance. 


The technology is not new or revolutionary, barriers to entry are low, and there is little in terms of product differentiation: Fleet

telematics is a commodity service. The industry is rapidly crowding with competitors and price has become the primary lever for closing 


new business. We believe that the worsening competitive landscape is catching up with FLTX.  





Consistent with this assessment, FLTX’s average revenue per vehicle under subscription has been trending downward. We believe this 


metric will continue to decline over the long term as the result of FLTX having no competitive advantage.

A more recent competitive threat likely to impact the economics of many players in the industry concerns cellular companies, such as 


AT&T, Verizon, Sprint, and T-Mobile, now offering their own fleet tracking solutions. This carries particular relevance to Fleetmatics and 


others because they are dependent on the use of cellular networks to deliver their services. Further, the cellular providers can use their 


size and scale to institute deep price cuts, as AT&T did recently.  AT&T is currently offering a $30/month plan, at no upfront cost, with 


the initiation of a 3 year contract, similar to Fleetmatics’ plan. 


Another major competitive threat has come in the form of CalAmp Corp’s recent acquisition of Wireless Matrix in December 2012. The 


implications for FLTX are so significant that it recently updated its Risk Factors to include the following statement: 


Industry consolidation may result in increased competition, which could result in a loss of customers or a reduction in 
revenue. Some of our competitors have made or may make acquisitions or may enter into partnerships or other strategic 
relationships to offer more comprehensive services than they individually had offered or achieve greater economies of scale. In 
addition, new entrants not currently considered to be competitors may enter our market through acquisitions, partnerships or 
strategic relationships. For example, CalAmp Corp., our primary supplier of in-vehicle devices, recently announced the 
acquisition of Wireless Matrix Corporation, which offers fleet tracking applications. We expect these trends to continue as 
companies attempt to strengthen or maintain their market positions. Many of the potential entrants, particularly those 
providing enterprise-level solutions and those who historically focused on the long-haul industry, may have competitive 
advantages over us, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, more varied services and larger marketing 
budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources.   
 


CalAmp has already aggressively cut its prices for comparable services, offering a $32/month plan with no upfront costs, and a 3 year 


contract.  Later in the report, we will illustrate that FLTX’s capex costs per new subscriber recently increased dramatically. This further 


illustrate the pressure CalAmp may be exerting on the company. 





In summary, we believe Fleetmatics offers no apparent competitive advantage over the competition; it provides commodity service in 


the midst of a worsening competitive landscape, while better capitalized companies enter the fray.

Founding Shareholder Tied to Previous Accounting Fraud  
 


Given that FLTX has adopted very aggressive expense accounting policies and taken to aggressive revenue tactics, we believe the 


involvement of its founding investor in a previous fraud warrants caution. As elaborated below, Bill McCabe of Oyster Capital sold his 


stake in FLTX in 2010 to a private equity group but would continue his involvement with the company through 2012 via an opaquely 


structured management services agreement executed by and between FLTX and an entity affiliated with him. This agreement was 


structured to terminate in 2014, but was ultimately settled prematurely and terminated in August 2012, immediately prior to FLTX’s 


October 2012 IPO; while it is unclear exactly why the contract was terminated prematurely, in light of the questionable timing at which 


the termination occurred, it is possible Fleetmatics sought to avoid potential investor inquiries pertaining to the fraud as it prepared to 


IPO. Regardless, it doesn’t add up.   


While it is unclear exactly why the contract was terminated prematurely, one possible reason is that Fleetmatics wanted to distance 


itself from the SmartForce fraud in preparation for its October 2012 IPO. In 2010, we noticed FLTX reported an opaque “Related Party 


Transaction.”  It signed a Management Services Agreement with Privia Enterprises that resulted in $15M of fees for services we have yet 


to determine. Language from company filings and key tenets of the deal follow:  


 
In November 2010, we entered into a consulting and non--compete agreement, or the Management Services Agreement, with Privia 


Enterprises Limited, or Privia, a company controlled by certain of our former shareholders, one of whom continued to serve as a member of 


our Board of Directors through February 2012. Pursuant to this agreement, in exchange for consulting services to be performed by Privia, we 


agreed to pay Privia up to $15.0 million in three separate installments if we sold a specified number of subscriptions, measured by unit 


installation, during each of the twelve months ending March 31, 2012, 2013 and 2014... On August 20, 2012, we paid Privia an aggregate of 


$7,800 in full satisfaction of all present and future amounts that are payable by us under the Management Services Agreement.  





Privia is registered at “Oyster Point” and is majority controlled by Oyster Capital, a private investment entity based in the Isle of Man 


that was Fleetmatics’ original backer. Although Oyster would dispose of its FLTX stake in 2010, certain of Oyster’s members would 


continue to advise the company through this Management Services Agreement through 2012. 





Our research indicates Oyster Capital, and Privia by extension, is the private entity of Irish businessman William “Bill” McCabe, who 


formerly founded, and served as CEO and Chairman of SmartForce PLC (formerly known as CBT), an e-learning company from the 


dotcom era.  In 1998, McCabe, CBT, and other defendants were the subject of class action lawsuits for allegedly issuing materially false 


statements regarding CBT's financial condition and business prospects in a scheme to artificially inflate the value of CBT shares. In 1999, 


CBT, McCabe, and other alleged perpetrators settled the suit for $32m.  After that case was settled, improprieties appear to have 


continued at CBT / SmartForce.  Six additional class actions were filed in 2002, some naming McCabe as a defendant, for more 


wrongdoing that allegedly occurred at SmartForce from 1999 to 2002. The company that had at the time just acquired SmartForce, 


SkillSoft, announced that SmartForce’s accounting and financial results could not be relied upon, forcing a writedown and accounting 


restatements. Specifically, the lawsuits asserted that the SmartForce fraud consisted of the following shenanigans:    





1. Improperly recognized revenue from software sales, including: 


a. Backdating of revenue 


b. Improper revenue recognition from multi-year contracts 


c. Improper revenue recognition from reseller and barter agreements 


2. Improper capitalization of expenses 


3. Improperly recording research and development costs and accounting for bad debt 


4. Failure to write down assets that were permanently impaired 


5. Issuance of materially misleading statements to illicit gains from sales of stocks 


The defendants at SmartForce admitted to knowingly overstating SmartForce’s revenues by at least $116 million and understating net 


income losses by at least $126 million during the time of the fraud. Ultimately, SkillSoft took a $255 million impairment charge for all its 


costs related to the failed acquisition.

Internal Controls Deficiencies – an Open Door for Committing Improprieties 
 
As a cautious research firm, it goes without saying that we are always wary of companies that report internal financial control 


weaknesses. Fleetmatics is one such company. We go to great lengths and commit substantial resources to verify the claims companies 


make in their filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission. Over the past several years, Prescience Point sat at the forefront 


of exposing frauds perpetuated by scores of Chinese reverse-merged firms trading on US exchanges.  Based on our experience, 


weaknesses in internal controls are amongst the most glaring warning signs in public companies, as they leave an open door for frauds 


and other improprieties to be committed.  Per Fleetmatics’ initial Prospectus:  





A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there 


is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or 


detected on a timely basis. 





Fleetmatics had not undergone an audit until 2012 (just prior to the IPO) and when it did, it received a very bad grade from the auditor, 


which found material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting significant enough to warrant a restatement of certain 


statements of cash flows. The significance of FLTX’s deficiencies are highlighted by the company having disclosed them as one of its 


highest risk factors, which is not typical.   





In filing its initial F-1 in August 2012, the company issued the following warning:  





1. We did not have sufficient formalized policies and procedures to ensure that complete and accurate, consolidated financial 


information was prepared and reviewed timely in accordance with U.S. GAAP; 


2. We lacked sufficient and timely formalized monthly, quarterly and annual financial data reviews and analysis; 


3. We lacked sufficient integrated systems to consolidate multi-currency financial information in a complete, accurate and timely 


manner; and 


4. We lacked a sufficient number of resources to completely and accurately record accounting transactions in accordance with U.S. 


GAAP as well as resources with the technical accounting expertise to completely and accurately account for complex and unique 


transactions in a timely manner, and to prepare and review financial statements and footnote disclosures  





As of the company’s recent F-1, filed on September 30, 2013, weaknesses number 1 and 2 initially noted above were still noted as 


unrectified.  And it appears problems continue to surface in Fleetmatics’ financials. On January 18, 2013 the company filed an amended 


6K which contained in Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements additional accounting problems affecting cash flow classification: 





The Company has restated its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2012 and 2011 


to correct certain errors. In 2012, the Company determined that its process for preparing its statement of cash flows for interim 


periods did not accurately reflect total purchases of property and equipment due to an error in the application of the non-cash 


adjustment between purchases of property and equipment and accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities. 


This error did not exist in the Company’s annual statements of cash flows. The result of the correction of this error is an increase 


in cash flows provided by operating activities with a corresponding increase in cash flows used in investing activities. In addition, 


certain other errors impacting Loss on disposal of property and equipment and other assets, Prepaid expenses and other current 


and long-term assets, and Purchases of property and equipment were identified. No other financial statements are affected by 


these adjustments. 





Furthermore, as elaborated upon in the section that below, we have identified significant and inexplicable inconsistencies between the

Unreconciled PP&E and Capital Expenditures, and Additional Problems Lurking 
  
In the table below, we have carefully analyzed all financial reporting period changes in Fleetmatics’ property, plant and equipment 


(“PP&E”) account vis-à-vis the same period reported cash flow statement purchases of PP&E. Total period additions to the PP&E account 


on the balance sheet should approximate the reported purchases on the cash flow statement. A major discrepancy occurred in Q4 2012 


when the PP&E account increased by just $6.4m, but the cash flow statement reported purchases of PP&E and capitalized software were 


$11.2 million. We are not certain of the drivers behind these discrepancies, but in light of the company’s choice to adopt aggressive 


accounting measures that exaggerate its business economics, we must acknowledge the risk of an attempt to artificially boost current-


period EPS, by keeping assets off its balance sheet and eliminating associated depreciation expenses.

Putting on the Game Face Ahead of 3 Secondaries in 7 oonths..  
 


Fleetmatics appears to have dressed itself up to court investors ahead of its July and September 2013 secondary offerings. It reported 


positive free cash flow for the first time ever in Q1’2013 and again in Q2’2013, driven by an increase in its deferred revenue account that 


resulted from increasingly extending discounts to ramp customer acquisitions.   





Deferred Revenue Games Played to Boost Cash Flow Ahead of Secondaries? 
 


For the first time in its history as a public company, FLTX reported positive free cash flow in Q1’2013 and again in Q2’2013. A closer look, 


however, reveals the turn in free cash flow to be largely the result of an increase in its deferred revenue balance, driven primarily by 


more customers prepaying all or a portion of their contracted balances in exchange for a discount. We have attained evidence that this is 


continuing and it seems to be a central aspect of its sales pitch: In July 2013 we attained a customer contract (Appendix II) which 


prominently displays the discounts offered in exchange for prepayments. This directly contradicts management’s claims, and its 


guidance to the Street going into its IPO less than 1 year ago, that these discounts would cease.  FLTX is continuing to encourage its 


customers to prepay by dangling the discount carrot in what may have been an attempt to boost revenue growth and accelerate cash 


flow collection to dress the company up in courting investors for its two recent, back-to-back secondary offerings.  





FLTX’s Deferred Revenue Recently Increased Driven By Heavy Prepayment Promotions 





 
“Net cash provided by changes in our operating assets and 
liabilities primarily consisted of a $3.1 million increase in deferred 
revenue, $1.4 million increase in accounts payable, accrued 
expenses, and other current liabilities, and a $0.3 million increase 
in accrued income taxes, partially offset by a $1.2 million increase 
in prepaid expenses and other assets and $1.8 million increase in 
our accounts receivable from customers. The increase in deferred 
revenue was attributable to a greater number of customers in 2013 
than in 2012 prepaying for a portion of their subscription. The 
increase in our accounts payable and accrued expenses resulted 
from our increased spending due to the growth of our business.”

Going into its 2012 IPO, FLTX had led analysts to believe that because the company was no longer cash-strapped it didn’t have much of 


an appetite for discounting contracts in exchange for upfront payments, and its deferred revenue balance would be declining in coming 


quarters, implying.  Per the Q4’2012 conference call: 


... we have historically allowed customers to prepay full or periodic amounts towards their subscription to improve our cash flow 


in exchange for a discount. And while upfront payments still occur, they have sharply declined in frequency as the cost of our 


capital and corresponding discounts has decreased.  


It can be assumed that Analysts’ views were based on certain representations made by management about decreasing the frequency of 


discounting and the company’s ability to grow free cash flow without growing the deferred revenue account. The following observation 


was related by a sell-side analyst in reports issued subsequent to FLTX’s IPO. 





Stifel Initiation Report, Oct 2012 William Blair, Oct 2012 Bank of America, Nov 2012 
Although Fleetmatics’ model has many of the 
attractive attributes of a SaaS model, most notably 
initial three-year contract terms and generally 
favorable upfront economics for its customers, one 
trait it does not share is a meaningful deferred 
revenue balance. We expect Fleetmatics deferred 
revenue balance to decline over the next couple of 
years for two primary reasons: (1) Fleetmatics 
previously engaged in fleet leasing services with its 
customers via third parties that resulted in upfront 
payments, but ceased doing so in January 2011 ($19 
million expected drawdown); and (2) in response to 
macro conditions, FLTX had offered customers 
discounts of 3%-7% in exchange for paying their 
annual subscription fees upfront. The company 
engaged in this practice for a period of a few years, 
but stopped in 2012 once it was able to restructure 
its outstanding debt at a much lower rate 


As we discussed in the “Contracts and Billing” section, 
on page 16, Fleetmatics’ deferred revenue balance 
should continue to decline as the company recognizes 
revenue from the contracts paid up front by third-
party leasing companies. Fleetmatics ended the 
relationships with these leasing companies in 
December 2010, but about 70% of the outstanding 
total deferred revenue balance (in our estimate) is 
related to these contracts. For this reason—and 
because the majority of customers (more than 90%) 
are billed monthly in advance—our billings proxy of 
revenue plus the sequential change in deferred 
revenue is not a relevant forward-looking metric. 
Deferred revenue decreased 20% year-over-year and 
3% sequentially in the second quarter of 2012. 


Deferred revenue drawdown: 
FleetMatics’ customer base consists of SMBs that 
usually pay with a credit card on a monthly basis. It 
was among the first in the industry to pioneer a 
subscription model where customer do not have to 
pay upfront for the GPS unit and the cost is 
bundled into the monthly fee. This made it easier for 
the SMBs to adopt FleetMatics’ service, but required 
them to incur upfront costs for purchasing the 
GPS unit. To fund these purchases and support 
growth of the business in its early years, FleetMatics 
used a third party to lease its receivables and get 
prepayments on its multi-year contracts. 





Company Can’t Hide that Customer Acquisition Costs are Growing Faster Than Revenues  
 


FLTX states its key competitive advantage is its efficient lead generation and sales model. We have been closely following its 


trends in advertising expense, and in particular, how effective this expense has be in converting new vehicle subscriptions. 


The company has never fully disclosed customer acquisition costs, but we think our measure is a good proxy. The chart on 


the left indicates that advertising costs rose +73% in 2011 and +78% in 2012 – multiples of revenue growth. Meanwhile, 


costs per new vehicle subscription are also marching higher as the company desperately pays more for incremental growth. 





Advertising Costs Per New Vehicle Addition Risk Factor Warning on Rising Lead Generation Costs 





Our dependence on various lead generation programs could adversely affect our 
operating results if we need to pay more for such programs or we are unable to 
attract new customers at the same rate. 
 
We use a number of lead generation programs to promote our solutions. 
Significant increases in the pricing of one or more of our lead generation channels 
would increase our overall lead generation costs or cause us to choose less 
expensive and perhaps less effective channels. For example, a portion of our 
potential customers locate our website through search engines, such as Google, 
Bing, and Yahoo!, representing one of the most efficient means for generating 
cost-effective SMB customer leads. If search engine companies modify their 
search algorithms in a manner that reduces the prominence of our listing, or if our 
competitors’ search engine optimization efforts are more successful than ours, 
fewer potential customers may click through to our website. In addition, the cost 
of purchased listings has increased in the past and may continue to increase in the 
future

Beyond the Pitch 
 


Fleetmatics and its bankers have gone to great lengths to pitch the company as a high margin SaaS business with an enormous global 


market opportunity. A deeper analysis reveals nothing more than a capital-intense software company that has low entry barriers and is 


structurally difficult to profitably scale. 


The Reality of Fleetmatics’ End Market 
 


Fleetmatics’ management guides investors to estimate its eligible market opportunity using the total number of worldwide vehicles in 


local commercial fleet markets as a basis; they also point to low levels of penetration to imply sustainability in the company’s growth 


trajectory.  Acting on this guidance, however, yields little in the form of valuable information needed to assess FLTX’s prospects. 





To demonstrate, per CEO James Travers (Q4’2012 conference call),  





To start, the market for fleet management solutions is large, growing and underpenetrated. We estimate that the market we 


serve represents more than 61 million vehicles or an approximate $30 billion market opportunity. We also estimate the market 


to be only penetrated approximately 9%, which provides the company with significant opportunity to maintain our growth. 








But discussions focusing on the total number of vehicles operated by SMBs are useless diversions. The data point is far too broad and 


provides little to no informational value toward deriving an estimate for the quantity of vehicles currently open to fleet telematics 


service offerings, a data point necessary for getting to the bottom of FLTX’s eligible market opportunity and understanding the 


company’s long-term prospects.  


And the market penetration of fleet telematics services amongst SMBs is low for a reason, and it is likely to remain so. As a point of 


reference, the average Fleetmatics customer has an 18-vehicle fleet, and according to Jim Travers (Q1’13 conference call), “14, 15, 18 


vehicle-sized customers… are what we really focus on.”  SMBs of this size operate on thin margins, have high failure rates and low 


technology adoption rates. Accordingly, the results of a survey published by Automotive Fleet magazine indicate that of SMBs with less 


than 100 vehicles in their fleets, 80% are not considering telematics and only 15.7% who aren’t current users are considering telematics. 



http://www.automotive-fleet.com/channel/fuel-management/article/story/2012/06/fleet-s-brave-new-world-fleets-look-at-challenges-ahead.aspx
www.presciencepoint.com 
22 


This alone indicates that a consideration of the total number of existing SMB-owned vehicles to assess FLTX’ market opportunity would 


result in the vast overstatement its eligible market, and hence, true potential. It also indicates that a presenting the company’s prospects 


in this manner is misdirecting.  





FLTX is an Aggressive Telesales Organization, not a High-Tech SaaS Company 
 
FLTX underwent a significant strategy change in 2010.  An aggressive telesales operation was rolled out which converted most of the 


customer accounts to credit card and monthly billing from invoices and up---front annual payments. These changes can dramatically 


improve sales cycles and lower costs, but can also lead to unsustainable business practices. The most significant result of this change is 


the much smaller up-front monthly collection prior to account activation.  It’s much easier to convince an SMB to pay just $40 upfront 


for the first month than having to pay $500 for the year.  However, if the SMB is not aware of the terms, than it’s locked into $40/month 


for 3 years (as evidenced below). This could result in a tidal wave of cancellations in a few years. Additionally, customers must go 


through the hassle of shutting down an SMB credit card used for various expenses in order to stop payment.  That friction alone might 


prevent some customers from disputing a contract.  


It should be telling that the top-listed item in the “Our Key Competitive Strengths” section of Fleetmatics’ prospectus is its telesales 


model and not its product:  


Efficient and scalable customer acquisition model. We have developed a scalable sales and marketing model that is focused on 


the efficient generation of a large number of customer leads, primarily through digital advertising, such as search engine 


marketing and optimization and email marketing as well as targeted outbound sales efforts. These techniques provide us with a 


flow of low-cost, qualified leads, both in the U.S. and internationally. We believe our marketing approach provides us with a 


cost-efficient and highly effective means of targeting and accessing the vast and geographically diverse SMB market and 


converting leads into paying subscribers. 


The prospectus also states that Fleetmatics has only 1 issued US patent on its technology, which bolsters our argument that Fleetmatics 


is not a dynamic technology company, and merely a sales organization.   The company’s organizational structure also supports this view. 


Per the table below, three of eight members of the executive management team occupy sales or business development positions – the 


Chief Marketing Officer (CMO), SVP of Global Business Development, and EVP of Global Sales. The EVP of Global Sales is the second 


highest paid executive at the company. We note that the original CMO, Karen Leavitt, abruptly resigned post-IPO in Nov 2012 according 


to her LinkedIn bio, but the company never announced this executive departure, and announce her replacement until August 2013. 





There are over a dozen fleet telematics companies that leverage the same core third party components: GPS Satellites, Mapping Data, 


and Cellular bandwidth. Again, why are SMBs (80% first time telematics users) signing up for a 3-year non-cancellable contract with FLTX, 


amounting to $1500/vehicle? A big reason is that FLTX telesales reps get full 3-year commissions paid upfront so there is a large 


incentive to do “whatever it takes” in order to sign up a customer and then let FLTX’s customer service and legal departments deal with 


any misunderstandings. Finally, while Internet review and complaint boards can’t be relied upon literally, they can reveal company 


insights if certain recurring practices are revealed. We have included and underlined key statements from both employees and 


customers from different geographic regions that portray a “boiler room” type environment.

Fleetmatics Employee Reviews 
Current Employee – US Existing Account Executive in Rolling Meadows, IL  
SUBMITTED: December 5, 2012 
Pros – The only pro's are that there are some great people that work for 
Fleetmatics and they do promote from within.  


Cons – The current customer base has been lied to while being locked up in 


a contract for 3---4 years. The management does not manage or lead. The 


price is TOO high for what it offers and the add on features do not work well. 


This is the first sales team I have ever seen where people outcast the new hires 


and make it known they are making fun of them. There is no training 


program at all There are no defined processes for almost anything. If you ask 


3 people how to do one thing you’ll get three answers. I can go on and on

Fleetmatics Customer Reviews 


AUTHOR: Yevgen P. --- Manhattan (United States of America)  


SUBMITTED: October, 2011  
Over the phone when I called them everything was nice. I said to myself what a 
great company, but when the service was down for many times and I said I want 
to close my account, they said no, because I signed up the agreement for 36 
months with Mr. Lawrence Pritchett. When I spoke with him over the phone and 
asked, what if I want to cancel my agreement? He said, No problem at any time. 
He lied to me. Now I am stuck with this agreement. I don't have anymore my two 
cars on the road, but they still want my money. My advice. Don't sign up! until 
you read very carefully their agreement. On the phone they can tell you anything, 
but then when they fax to you an agreement they ask immediately to sign and fax 
them back. I will fight for my rights. I will file a complaint everywhere about this 
Fleetmatics gps global positioning tracking devices company.

AUTHOR: Anonymous --- Dayton (United States of America) SUBMITTED: 
March 13, 2012  


Our company subscribed to Fleetmatics vehicle tracking system almost 


two years ago with a three year contract. The first few months were fine ---   


there were no issues and circumstances were status quo. As soon as we 


had an instance where we needed some customer service resolution, the 


account went downhill fast. There are several issues that we attempted to 


address with Fleetmatics and we were ignored on all items. We couldn't 


get an answer to numerous phone call and email requests.  





One of our requests was to remove our account from auto---pay and send 


monthly invoice so we could pay by check. We wanted to discontinue using 


the credit card that was being billed. That request was ignored along with 


the rest of our issues. Eventually, we closed the credit card anyways. We 


decided that would surely get some attention. Instead of calling to check 


on the payments or answering our numerous requests to send invoices, 


Fleetmatics sent us to collections AND turned off the internet access.  





We have been dealing with this for well over a year and still have no 


resolution for any of the issues. We will be forced to pay the entire contract 


despite the fact that the service is not available to us and has not been for 


months.  


(Source --- Ripoffreport.com)  





The employee examples above suggest that sales reps are instructed not to disclose that contracts are non-cancellable in order to get a 


customer’s credit card information and initiate billing.  The first customer example states a sales person was deceptive in giving 


assurance that the contract could be cancelled prior to expiration; the second customer example suggests the post-sales customer care 


(typically a cost center) is sufficiently lacking.  


Finally, early evidence of suspicious call center activity emerged in the final months prior to FLTX’s IPO. As detailed in the filings below, 


FLTX is the defendant in a class action lawsuit stating that it failed to notify customers that they were being recorded. Notifying the 


customer of recorded calls is a potential impediment to sales and suggests that FLTX was willing to skirt “Call Center 101” rules:  


August 14, 2012, a putative class action complaint was filed in the Sixth Judicial Circuit in Pinellas County, Florida, entitled U.S. Prisoner Transport, et. al. v. 


Fleetmatics USA, LLC, et. al., Case No. 1200-9933 CI-20. The complaint alleges that we recorded thousands of telephone calls in violation of Florida Statutes 


Section 934.03. The complaint seeks certification of a putative class of all individuals and businesses residing in Florida who spoke with any representatives of 


our offices in Florida on the telephone and had their telephone conversations recorded without their consent or advance notice, from the date of the earliest

Valuation and Price Target 
 


Street Analysts’ Incorrect SaaS Peer Set Artificially Inflates FLTX Price Target  
 


The consensus price target of $44.75 values FLTX at 59x 2013E normalized earnings, a metric that, as discussed previously, is inflated by 


the company’s aggressive accounting practices and fails to capture the true economics of FLTX’s business.  








Wall St. analysts not only take the company’s financials at face value without adjusting for the egregious accounting we’ve previously 


highlighted, but also mistakenly position the company as a high growth SaaS stock without taking into consideration any of the 


fundamental industry attributes likely to ultimately constrain the company’s future success. To illustrate, Bank of America attempts to 


convince investors to view Fleetmatics’ valuation in relation to Saleforce.com (CRM), NetSuite (N) and Constant Contact (CTCT) all of 


which are companies with broad software solutions that are applicable to companies of any size and industry.  








Bofa Initiation, Oct 2012 


Sell-side valuation assumptions fail to recognize that FLTX’s software solutions are narrowly focused on companies that have automotive 


fleets and mobile assets to track. Numerous companies exist that offer similar tracking solutions, are more directly comparable, 


generate positive free cash flow, and trade at significant valuation discounts to Fleetmatics.

Based on our analysis, Fleetmatics’ is far better defined against a peer set consisting of Mix Telematics (MIXT), CalAmp (CAMP), Numerex 


(NMRX), Garmin (GRMN), Trimble (TRMB), TomTom (TOM), Lojack (LOJN), Ituran Location and Control (ITRN), ID Systems (IDSY), 


Orbcomm (ORBC) and TeleCommunication Systems (TSYS). This peer set represents a broad range of companies in fleet, mobile 


resource, and machine-to-machine tracking solutions. Growth investors looking for leverage to these industries can get much cheaper 


exposure by investing in any of these other companies.  











The charts and table below illustrate the extreme valuation disconnect between Fleetmatics, and what other telematic solution 


providers trade for. Our analysis suggests that Fleetmatics should be valued closer to 2x, 11x, and 20x 2014E revenues, EBITDA, and EPS, 


respectively.

Recent IPO of Direct Comp MiX Telematics Indicates FLTX’ Valuation Dislodged from Reality 
 


On August 9, 2013 Mix Telematics (NYSE: MIXT), FLTX’s closest public company comparable, priced its IPO on the NYSE at $16.00 per 


share and raised $65 million. A global provider of fleet and mobile asset management solutions delivered as a SaaS solution, MIXT has 


failed to garner anywhere near the valuation achieved by Fleetmatics despite having a superior operating financial model, comparable 


growth rate, and more conservative accounting assumptions. MIXT trades at 3x, 14x, and 38x 2013E revenue, EBITDA, and EPS, 


respectively.  FLTX trades at 9.7x, 31x, and 59x 2013E revenue, EBITDA, and EPS, respectively.  


To illustrate, MIXT has a globally diversified customer base in 112 countries and serves more than 4,000 fleet operators at the enterprise 


level. In contrast, FLTX derives 96% of its revenues from just three countries, serves more than 19,000 customers, and focuses on the 


SMB market. The costs of targeting SMBs can be observed by the dramatically different Sales and Marketing costs between the two 


companies. FLTX reports a Sales & Marketing Expense margin of 31.4% vs. MIXT’s 10.4%; this significant variance in cost structures does 


not even account for the relative benefit FLTX derives by aggressively capitalizing and amortizing sales commissions.  





As previously discussed, another key difference relates the each company’s treatment of installed hardware devices and operating cash 


flow. MIXT is significantly more cash generative than FLTX, selling its hardware to its customers upon contract initiation; FLTX, on the 


other hand, essentially gives its devices away in anticipation of recouping its cost over the life of the contract.  


MIXT’s gross margin is lower than FLTX’s, as it reflects both product and service hardware sales. We should again point out that FLTX’s 


gross margin is also artificially inflated by the aggressive assumption that its average customer life is 6 years, which it uses to justify a 6 


year depreciation schedule for its devices. MIXT has a 17 year business history, and structures contracts with a 3 year subscription plan, 


and a default month-to-month or yearly auto renewal.  MIXT’s device depreciation period of 3 – 5 years appears to support our concern 


that FLTX’s 6 year depreciation period is aggressive.   


Overall, MIXT’s model generates significantly more free cash flow than FLTX, has more conservative accounting, but is trading at a 


substantial valuation discount. This discount is not justified by the relative size or growth differentials between both companies.

Private M&A Deal Values Support our Comps Analysis, Imply a Dramatically Lower Valuation 
 
It’s also instructive to look at private M&A deals in the fleet and mobile asset tracking industry. A flurry of activity in the past few years 


provides a sample set sizeable enough to draw useful insights toward assessing FLTX’s intrinsic value. Very recent deals include Avista 


Capital’s acquisition of Telular, Danaher’s acquisition of Navman Wireless, and Calamp’s acquisition of Wireless Matrix.  





Per the table below, M&A transactions support the results of our public comps analysis, with average transaction revenue and EBITDA 


multiples of 2.3x and 9.1x, respectively.

Follow the Money: Insiders Cashing Out 
 


FLTX equity appears inflated beyond reasonable measure, explaining why its largest shareholder and management team have rushed to 


liquidate their holdings at prices ranging from $17 and $46 per share in 3 secondary offerings all having taken place in less than a year 


(January, July and September, 2013). In less than one years’ time, the company’s largest shareholder has liquidated $760m worth of 


shares, reducing its equity ownership to just 1.6% from 94.6% pre-IPO. Management has sold shares alongside its anchor shareholder, 


collectively reducing their ownership from 6.3% at IPO to 4.2%.   





Insiders Have Liberally Sold Stock in Under 1yr Since its IPO …And Its Largest Shareholder Has Reaped Enormous Gains 














Price Target and Conclusion 
 


The mirage of FLTX’s reported gross margin, EBITDA, and EPS, has existed for long enough to keep the stock price levitated and for 


insiders to dump their holdings at inflated prices, leaving shareholders holding the bag just as the business appears to be peaking.  





Based on our analysis, FLTX’s stock price is at risk of significant downside from current levels:  





1. The company’s current financial statements dramatically overstate its earnings and cash flow potential due to the company 


having adopted aggressive accounting policies.  It capitalizes, rather than expenses, sales commission costs and amortizes 


them over a 6 year period – this is a highly aggressive policy and has the effect of inflating its EBITDA and EPS. It capitalizes and 


depreciates in-vehicle device costs over an unjustifiably long 6 year average customer life, another aggressive policy that 


significantly inflates the company’s gross margin, EBITDA and EPS. Overall, we believe Fleetmatics’ 2012 gross margin was 


inflated by 400 basis points and reported Adj. EBITDA and Adj. EPS were overstated by 27% and 33% 


2. The company reports an aggregate Gross Churn rate that appears to understate the true gross churn rate by >50%. Based on 


our analysis, its true gross churn rate is 20-25% 


3. Our findings of the involvement of its founding investor and former board member (up to 2010) in a previous fraud raises red 


flags. Although he sold his equity stake in 2010 to a private equity group, he would continue his involvement with the company 


through 2012 via an opaquely structured management services agreement executed by and between FLTX and an entity 


affiliated with him. This agreement was structured to terminate in 2014, but was terminated prematurely in August 2012, just 


one month ahead of FLTX’ 2012 IPO; the timing indicates Fleetmatics likely sought to distance itself from him to avoid any 


potential incremental scrutiny the affiliation may have provoked while courting investors for its IPO

4. Weaknesses in internal controls are amongst the most glaring warning signs in public companies; they leave the door wide 


open for frauds and other improprieties to be committed. Fleetmatics’ deficiencies are significant enough to have necessitated 


the restatement of certain 2011 and 2012 statements of cash flows. Further, we have identified significant inconsistencies 


between the company’s PP&E and capital expenditure accounts. We are not certain of why the discrepancies exist, but in light 


of the company’s choice to adopt aggressive accounting measures that obfuscate its profitability, we must acknowledge the 


risk of an attempt to artificially boost EPS 


5. Fleetmatics’ management guides investors to estimate its eligible market opportunity using the total number of worldwide 


vehicles in local commercial fleet markets as a basis, which would indicate a $30bn opportunity; they also point to low levels of 


penetration to imply sustainability in the company’s growth trajectory. Their guidance, however, is misdirecting and 


exaggerates its eligible market opportunity by multiples. The total number of vehicles operated by SMBs carries little in 


informational value in deriving an estimate for the quantity of vehicles currently open to fleet telematics service offerings, an 


estimate necessary in calculating FLTX’ eligible market opportunity.  The results of a survey indicate that of SMBs with less than 


100 vehicles in their fleets, 80% are not considering telematics and only 15.7% who aren’t current users are considering it  


6. The competitive landscape is intensifying, with suppliers and cellular carriers becoming direct competitors and forcing price 


compression in the industry. Ultimately, with little in technological and competitive advantage or product differentiation, the 


likelihood of increasing customer churn, and lower future profits is a very real risk  


7. Street analysts focus on positioning the SaaS attributes of the company to justify a high valuation multiples, but fail to mention 


the numerous comparable companies in the asset tracking space or point to M&A deals, each of which points to a much lower 


valuation. The very recent IPO of MiX Telematics underscores FLTX’s extreme valuation disconnect with sector peers  


Given our concerns regarding the unsustainable financial condition of its business and accounting and financial control issues, we see 


an above average risk of further financial restatements or SEC enforcement.  We believe FLTX should be valued closer to its mobile 


asset tracking and GPS products and services peers at 1.5x - 2.5x 2013E revenues and 8.0x - 13.0x our 2013E Adj. EBITDA of $44.7m, 


implying an intrinsic value in the range of $11 - $12 per share (~75% downside).
