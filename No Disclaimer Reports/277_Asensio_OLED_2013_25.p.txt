Universal Display’s “beat and raise” is invalid
and actually a “miss and lowering.”


Posted on November 13, 2013 by asensio.com


Wednesday, November 13, 2013.   The shares of Universal Display


Corp.’s common stock (“UDC”; NASDAQ: OLED) experienced a


counterintuitive and unjustified response to UDC’s purported “beat


and raise,” which was actually a “miss and lower.” UDC’s


engineered earnings “beat and raise” rested on UDC management’s


private representations to analysts during the second quarter,


which resulted in analyst estimates that were unrealistically low


and lower than any informed OLED industry observer would have


suspected, so long as UDC sales were in any way keeping pace with


OLED display shipments.


UDC purported “beat and raise” created a temporary distraction


from the fact that UDC’s reported results were lower than indicated


by OLED product sales and its financials continue to show


disturbing trends. Below we address UDC’s engineered Q3 beat, its


negative financial results, and attempts to obscure information


about its patent challenges and Samsung contract.


Introduction:


UDC’s third quarter growth was actually worse than industry OLED


mobile display shipments. With UDC’s updated guidance, UDC


admits that in the fourth quarter it will experience another quarter-


over-quarter decrease in OLED material sales. This result would be


drastically out of line with the 12% quarter-over-quarter growth in


OLED mobile shipments expected by the industry in Q4, according


to data compiled by the OLED Association. At the same time, UDC


failed to provide any meaningful information concerning its patent


challenges. In fact, UDC even failed to disclose the date of the


coming final EP-238 trial and hearing on its “fundamental” key

patent claims; UDC’s 10-Q only states dismissively that a hearing


will occur “in the second half of 2013.”


UDC’s omission and avoidance of the EP-238 trial is especially


egregious, since the patent represents its most basic claims to


phosphorescent iridium compounds, and the European Patent


Office (“EPO”) has already questioned the validity of claims to


“every OLED” which UDC did not disclose to investors. A highly


regarded expert with unique experience in the subject matter gave


an opinion finding that UDC made no valid invention in the


experiments used to support EP-238 and UDC’s other key patents.


UDC also gave one-sided, distorted opinion concerning recent


decisions in JP-024 and EP-395. The opinions that UDC provides


investors directly conflict with their admissions in court which


show UDC relied on others’ inventions, and conflict with its


statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”)


about potential “obsolescence” of UDC’s purported technology and


“competition” to justify its irregular accounting of Samsung’s


license payments.


Prior to UDC’s Q3 release, asensio.com warned that if UDC’s


materials sales in any way kept pace with display shipments, then


UDC would dramatically beat analyst estimates, which were based


on management’s evasive statements and misrepresentations that


one of its analysts called “frustrating.” The fact that UDC seems to


have misinformed analysts and then promoted its miss as a beat


only distracts investors from the sustained negative trends in UDC’s


financial statements, all the negative and adverse developments


that UDC is experiencing in patent litigation and how these patent


challenges negatively affect the value of its patents, which Lowe


Hauptman experts state are entirely undeserved. In fact, Lowe


Hauptman is advocating in court that EP-238 be revoked in its


entirety.


Red’s Continued Demise:


UDC’s red emitter sales continue to show year-over-year and


quarter-over-quarter declines, even though red emitter material is


UDC’s most established product in a market that UDC has repeatedly


told investors that it “owns.” Despite the year-over-year decline in


red emitter sales in dollars, UDC stated that it actually sold more red


material in grams than in the prior year quarter, according to UDC’s


10-Q. This means that the unit price discounts to Samsung are so


severe that UDC is still reporting less revenue, despite


extraordinary increases in OLED shipment volumes.


Growth Solely from Low-Margin, Low Value Host Material:


UDC’s growth in the third quarter is almost exclusively attributable


to sales of low-margin host materials, which UDC admits represents

a competitive business where UDC lacks significant intellectual


property. UDC’s gross margin continues to move lower. In fact, its


materials gross margin is now at 67%, lower than management’s


outlook only two quarters ago, when management stated that it


would remain “in the 70% to 75% range.”


Negative Sales Forecast:


UDC’s new guidance for 2013 implies that UDC will only generate


$25 million in revenue in the fourth quarter, net of the semi-annual


Samsung licensing fee. This means that UDC will be experiencing


another contraction in material sales quarter-over-quarter, despite


the double digit growth expected in Q4 OLED mobile display


shipments.


SEC Accounting Controversy:


UDC’s conference call shed no light on the SEC investigation into


UDC’s accounting, especially the accounting of revenue from


Samsung’s license fee payments. UDC has never given investors a


simple explanation of its irregular accounting of the Samsung


payments. UDC’s explanation to the SEC refers to nonsensical


“ratable recognition” and “proportional performance” to explain


why Samsung license revenue is only recognized when the fees


“become due and payable.” This was the subject of a previous


asensio.com report. We believe that the real motivation behind


UDC’s irregular accounting policy has to do with Samsung’s


termination rights, which were not part of the redacted agreement


filed with the SEC.


Patent Litigation Claims:


In UDC’s Q3 earnings conference call, management did not mention


the fact that its most central patent claims will be the subject of a


hearing in a matter of days (Nov. 21 – 22) that might result in a


sudden death situation for UDC’s business and UDC’s Samsung


contract. UDC also did not disclose that the Nov. 21st hearing will be


final. UDC still has not disclosed that the judicial Board of Appeal


that will be making a final decision after the November 21st


hearing has already made formal negative findings in an order


about UDC’s case.


Despite these material omissions, UDC went out of the way to


publicize a less significant patent being “upheld,” even though no


written decision has been released yet, even though UDC admits


that the patent’s claims were ‘narrowed’, and even though it was a


preliminary decision, not a final decision rendered by the Boards of


Appeal.

During the Q3 earnings call, UDC management referred to “four


early fundamental phosphorescent OLED inventions.” The expert


opinion that was cited in our earlier reports and that was filed in


UDC’s central patent opposition case shows that UDC made no


invention. UDC scientists conducted simple optimization


experiments using others’ inventions and then claimed credit for all


“phosphorescent OLED.” asensio.com published an expert-informed


review of the experiments that UDC claimed to be the basis for its


“inventions”, including its patent and government-funded DARPA


disclosures. Patent authorities have been chipping away at the


ludicrous scope of UDC’s claims, including in EP-238 and EP-870.


Based on our expert consultations, we believe UDC’s “invention”


claims will face a devastating blow at the hearing that starts Nov.


21st.
