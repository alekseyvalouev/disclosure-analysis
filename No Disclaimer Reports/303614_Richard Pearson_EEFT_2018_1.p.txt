Summary. As much as 30-40% of Euronet’s profits and EBITDA are generated solely by DCC revenues with ultra 
high margins. The sell side has largely missed this entirely. 


During 2017, scathing public criticism erupted from a wide array of journalists, travel advisers and celebrity TV 
hosts, directly alleging Euronet “fraud”, “rips offs” and “scams” with DCC. Evidence posted in photos, screenshots 
and videos. 


Multiple independent investigations then concluded specifically that “DCC should be banned”


Following the public scrutiny, a wide range of Euronet insiders began aggressively dumping their shares (and just 
ahead of a key vote in November 2017 by the EU Parliament) 


Since then, EU legislation covering DCC has passed multiple key milestones.


Final regulations are set to be passed by June 2018


Euronet trades on a steep premium to peers because of perceived growth prospects. Any reassessment will see 
disproportionate downside to the share price

Section I
Euronet is Overwhelmingly Dependent Upon DCC for 
Revenues, Profits and Growth 


Euronet’s share price has quintupled over the past five years due to strong growth in revenues, profits and cash 
flow.  


By far the largest contributor to profits and growth has been “Dynamic Currency Conversion” by which Euronet can 
extract fees of as much as 10-15% from unwitting ATM customers when they travel abroad.


Euronet refuses to disclose the contribution of DCC to its profits, but it is possible to calculate that DCC alone is 
responsible for 30-40% of all profits at Euronet. 


Sell side analysts under-estimate this huge reliance on DCC. Despite visible evidence in Europe, US sell side 
analysts model DCC fees (via currency spread) at just 4-6% rather than the widely observed 10-15%. 


Sell side analysts also fully dismiss the likelihood of a disruption in these DCC revenues, describing Euronet as a 
very “transparent” ATM operator.  


In mid 2017, following scathing public criticism and independent investigations, a wide range of Euronet insiders 
began aggressively dumping shares.

Euronet Worldwide: Financial Results and Performance 


Over the past five years, Euronet has seen strong growth in revenues, EBITDA, profits and cash flow. Margins 
have expanded steadily across the board.  As we will see below, the vast majority of this profitability and growth is 
being driven by the EFT Processing Segment. Furthermore, within that segment, the bulk of these profits, margins 
and growth are being driven specifically by DCC, which provides Euronet with incremental gross margins 
approaching 100%. 


As shown herein, Euronet’s profits, cash flow and growth are all being overwhelmingly driven by DCC and 
its ultra-high margins.   This is why the stock has quintupled.

Following Scathing Publicity and Investigations, Insiders Aggressively Dump 
Shares 


In the sections below we will see how vocal public criticism of Euronet’s DCC practices erupted in early 2017.  
Consumer advocacy groups then began a series of independent investigations just ahead of a key European 
Union vote on the future of DCC.  At just that time, insiders began aggressively dumping shares. 
As public scrutiny intensified in 2017, a wide range of insiders began aggressively dumping shares ahead of a key 
vote by the EU Parliament.

Euronet Dependence on EFT Segment (Including DCC) 


By far and above, the biggest driver of Euronet’s strong financial results has been its EFT Processing segment 
which largely focuses on ATM/POS transactions across Europe, the Middle East and Asia. EFT Processing is 
responsible for 74% of operating profits and more than 100% of recent profit growth, largely due to the ultra high 
profitability of DCC.  


It is quite noticeable that Euronet specifically refrains from disclosing the contribution it gets from DCC. Several 
analysts have acknowledged this absence and made their own estimates, which have then varied quite widely. At 
a minimum, common sense tells us that the incremental gross margin from DCC approaches 100%.  Euronet 
simply charges a higher price via Dynamic Currency Conversion in exchange for delivering the same amount of 
foreign currency.  The extra markup is therefore ≈100% profit margin that flows straight to operating profits and 
EBITDA. From Euronet’s most recent 10Q for September 2017, we can see the following. Euronet is estimated to 
keep 65% of the pure profit, sharing some with local partner merchants. 


For Euronet, the EFT Segment is responsible for 74% of operating profits and more than 100% of recent 
profit growth.  This is because of the ultra high margins brought in as a result of DCC transactions.

EFT Processing Segment - EBITDA Contribution 


For EBITDA, the contribution of EFT Processing largely parallels operating profit above, except that there is a 
moderate impact of depreciation compared to epay and Money Transfer.  As we saw above, with margins 
approaching 100%, any revenues from DCC flow straight through to EBITDA for Euronet, with Euronet keeping an 
estimated 65% of it.  


As part of its quarterly earnings announcement, Euronet discloses its adjusted EBITDA metric for each segment.  
Comparing the 3Q 2017 press release vs. the 3Q 2016 press release we can see the following changes in 
adjusted EBITDA by segment.


EBITDA  
($m)


3Q 2017
% of 
total


3Q 2016
% of 
total


Growth $ Growth %


EFT $   101.6 67.1% $     69.6 58.2% $   32.0 46%


epay $     18.2 12.0% $     17.5 14.6% $     0.7 4%


Money Transfer $     31.7 20.9% $     32.4 27.1% $    (0.7) -2%


Total $   151.5 100.0% $   119.5 100.0% $   32.0 


The key takeaways are largely in line with what we see in the table below. 


• The EFT Segment represented 67.1% of total EBITDA in 3Q 2017
• Total EBITDA grew by $32 million vs. 2016 – all of which was attributable to the EFT Segment
• Both epay and Money Transfer comprise much smaller contributions to EBITDA
• Despite occasional growth in top line revenues, neither epay nor Money Transfer are making any 


meaningful contribution to bottom line EBITDA growth 


EFT Processing (including DCC) is responsible for 67.1% of EBITDA and 46% of EBITDA growth.

DCC Specifically Drives As Much As 30-40% Of Overall Profits For All Of Euronet 


So far, Euronet has not been willing to disclose what percentage of its ATM fees are derived from DCC. On 
December 11th, Piper Jaffrey put out a research note estimating that DCC revenues amount to “at least” 10% of 
total EFT segment revenue.   Piper also stated that DCC “generates an operating margin materially above the 
current~25% segment margin.”   Piper currently has the highest share price on the street of $126.  But actually it 
easy to see that Piper is quite visibly wrong. 


Revenues from DCC are closer to 100% pure margin. This is just common sense. It becomes clear that sell 
side analysts (Piper and others) largely have zero understanding of just how important DCC is for 
Euronet’s bottom line.


So far the only analyst I have seen to attempt a quant approach (rather than gut estimate) on the real size of DCC 
contribution has been Northland Securities’ Mike Grondahl. On October 11th, he mapped out his estimate of DCC 
contribution, as shown in Figure 1. 


In deriving his number, the analyst himself notes that he: correctly excludes low margin ATMs in other countries, 
and he deliberately underestimates the number of actual ATM transactions in 2017. The numbers he uses on 
revenue per transaction are consistent with the rest of the sell side, which assume that Euronet is only charging 
around 4-6% on DCC transaction. The result of his deliberately conservative approach is that DCC alone accounts 
for fully 36.9% of Euronet’s EBITDA.   ($156m EBITDA from DCC ÷ Estimate of $423 million total EBITDA). 


The most important error here is that the single digit percentage revenue capture from DCC is just plain wrong. As 
we will see in section two, the reason for the outpouring of consumer ire is the fact that consumers, journalists, 
advocate groups and even the regulators all cite fees and costs of DCC which run well into double digits of up to 
12-15%. In other words, the real fee income from DCC is double (or more) compared to what Northland has 
identified.  But more importantly, Northland dismisses any chance of this gargantuan revenue source being 
disrupted by the impending European regulatory changes which will be finalized in the next few 2-5 months.  
Northland attributes the problems in DCC to isolated incidents and a few small, no-name bad actors.  


According to Northland:


“We believe this [EU] consultation has come out of the POS world where smaller merchants sometimes opt in for 
customers without their blessing and on the POS side disclosure and transparency might be lacking. We believe EEFT 
[Euronet] on the ATM side is very transparent with various disclosures including options, fees and choice (opt in) for 
consumers.” 


After you read Section II, come back and re-read the comments above describing Euronet’s assumed 
“transparency” and good practices.  You will then appreciate the disconnect.

Section II
Journalists, Consumer Groups, and Independent 
Investigations Weigh in on Euronet’s DCC 


In early 2017, scathing public criticism against Euronet intensified, with journalists, travel guides and TV hosts 
specifically describing Euronet’s DCC practices as a ”fraud”, “scam” or “rip off”. 


Following this public scrutiny, multiple Public Consumer Advocacy Groups launched independent investigations 
and conducted “secret shopper” trials.  


After analyzing thousands of transactions across 11 countries. These independent organizations each came to the 
same conclusion: that DCC offered no value to consumers and was being used to deliberately mislead customers 
into deeply detrimental transactions at a cost of hundreds of millions of Euros per year.


In October, each of these separate organizations recommended to the EU Parliament that DCC offerings by 
independent operators (including Euronet) should be banned outright.


In November (following their submission) Parliament voted to grant authority over DCC to the European 
Commission.


On January 13th, 2018,the new European Payment Services Directive became law, which will be implemented by 
the European Commission.


By no later than June 2018, final remedies over DCC will be formalized and published.

Latest Developments With DCC (What the Sell Side is Missing)


As we saw above analysts have grossly underestimated the true contribution from DCC to Euronet’s bottom line by a 
very wide margin.  They are not even close and we can see this in their reports and models. 


More importantly, these same analysts then repeatedly dismiss out of hand the prospects for these DCC revenues to 
be disrupted by a quick shift in policy. This upcoming policy implementation has just passed multiple key milestones 
and now only awaits final publication of determined remedies. 


The purpose of this section is to provide greater visibility on the impact of widening public coverage of DCC issues. 
You can then go back and determine for yourself if the sell side analysts are properly handicapping the likelihood of a 
disruption to DCC revenues. Over the past year, much of the building coverage of DCC abuses is quite specifically 
focused on Euronet, alleging that it is a deliberate “fraud” “scam” or “rip off” against consumers.


The accusations have repeatedly come from high profile public sources with large followings.  This includes 
professional journalists, travel TV hosts, holiday rental companies, and personal travel guides, among others. These 
public personas have taken it upon themselves to aggressively warn their followers in very strict and simple terms:  
First, never, ever elect for DCC.  Second, avoid Euronet altogether. To emphasize their points, these personas have 
published their evidence using screenshots, photos of receipts or step-by-step videos mapping out the described 
“fraud” against consumers. 


As much of that public attention unfolded in 2017, two major European consumer advocate groups (the BEUC and 
Finance Watch) then began conducting independent investigations of their own into DCC practices, including 
specifically Euronet.  Following their independent investigations into thousands of transactions across at least 10 
countries, each of these organizations both concluded that DCC was so abusive and without value to the consumers 
that the only suitable solution was an outright ban.  


I have made it a point to include the links to these findings from these investigations along with various 
examples of the evidence gathered in the form of screenshots, photos of receipts, videos etc.


The findings from these investigations were all submitted to the EU parliament in November 2017.  Two weeks later, 
Parliament voted to give authority over DCC to the European Commission to determine new measures on DCC as 
part of its Payment Services Directive 2. On January 13th, 2018, the new Payment Services Directive 2 was passed 
into law.  Its final recommendations will be made public during the 1st half of 2018 (in the next 2-5 months). 


After reading the next few pages, what you will realize is this:  
Even just a required increase in transparency will have a similar effect to an outright ban because no informed 
consumer would ever make the choice for DCC if the numbers were actually laid out for them in any coherent way. 
And in the meantime, very vocal public figures continue to increase their efforts to spread a very concise and 
categorical message: never select DCC and always avoid Euronet.

European Consumer Union: “Real solution: a ban on DCC”.
(Report dated: October 30, 2017)


The BEUC (“Bureau Européen des Unions de Consommateurs”) is an EU consumer Organization based in 
Brussels which has won major legislative battles protecting consumers in hot button areas of net neutrality, GM 
food labeling, mobile data price caps and consumer banking rights. During 2017, the BEUC began conducting 
independent investigations “secret shopper” investigations.  On October 30th, 2017, the BEUC published the 
findings from these activities.  There was no ambiguity:


“When choosing the DCC option in card payments and ATM withdrawals, the consumer is financially worse off in 
practically every single case.”


“British consumers travelling abroad are spending about £300 million every year in DCC fees. In certain cases the 
DCC fee is around 10%. This is much higher than a typical markup of 0-3% applied by the consumer’s bank.”


(Remember: The sell side still tells us that DCC fees only amount to 4-6% !!)


BEUC noted that when investigators were sent to 11 different countries to evaluate DCC, ”in all cases there was 
an increase in the price the consumer paid” of up to 12%.


A similar study of 1,500 transactions in Norway concluded “the consumer lost out in 99.7% of cases by choosing 
the exchange rate of the merchant’s bank” [i.e. by selecting DCC].  Again, the loss to consumers was cited as 
being up to 12.4%.


BEUC Quote: 


“Real Solution: A Ban on DCC. There is no practical solution to improve the current situation.  Therefore, we call for a  simple 
ban of this commercial practice”.

Finance-Watch.Org – “DCC providers should be banned” 
(Report dated: October 30, 2017) 


Finance Watch was created through a petition by members of European Parliament in the wake of the financial 
crisis. Nearly 200 national politicians and members of EU Parliament signed the petition. Finance Watch is set up 
as an independent non-profit, focused on addressing issues public interest between lawmakers and citizens, 
specifically in the area of financial services. 


On October 30th, Finance Watch submitted and published its Consultation Response to the EU, for inclusion in the 
November 14th vote by the EU on its “Action Plan on Financial Services”.


To Quote Finance Watch verbatim:


“DCC services are currently often presented to consumers to seem like the best options, or attract consumers to them.  This 
clearly justifies serious concerns over DCC services making concerted  attempts to mislead  consumers.”


“Based on public scandals involving available DCC services listed online there do not appear to be any that would allow 
consumers to benefit from better currency conversion rates.”


“There rather seem to be many situations where DCC services are deliberately aiming to mislead consumers.” 


“On the basis of the current evidence that can be seen online and elsewhere, DCC service providers seem to deliberately 
mislead consumers.  On this basis these DCC providers should be banned, because there does not appear to be any other clear 
way to ensure that they can benefit consumers”.  


Finance-Watch Quote:  


“DCC providers should be banned, because there does not appear to be any other clear way to ensure that they  can benefit 
consumers”.

Journalist Chris Lettner: Euronet Charging “Extortionate” Rates to Foreigners   
(Report dated: May 2017)


Chris Lettner is a professional journalist and photographer originally from Austria who travels to far-flung locales to 
report on under-covered topics. Lettner completed his degree in journalism from Anglo American University in 
Prague.  In the past, his projects have included such locations as Iran, Cuba and Myanmar (Burma).  His work has 
been featured on CNN, the BBC and Vice among other places. In 2017, Lettner put together a very methodical 
video presentation to show step by step the tactics used specifically by Euronet to steer and confuse consumers 
in Europe into a one sided transaction where they pay fees of as much as 10x their normal rates while receiving 
effectively nothing of value in return.


Here is a summary Lettner’s findings on Euronet, as conducted in the Czech Republic:


Scenario #1 – A consumer inserts a domestic (Czech) ATM card into a Euronet ATM.  There is no opportunity 
for DCC revenues for Euronet, so the company only gives options of very small withdrawals (up to €74) and 
charges a flat fee.


Scenario #2 – A consumer inserts a foreign (non Czech) card into a Euronet ATM, and then suddenly 
everything changes.  Euronet now has the potential to capture huge fee event with a massive spread. As a result, 
Euronet now offers the consumer to take out amounts which are 1,000% higher than in Scenario #1.   It also 
scrambles the order of the amounts shown, rather than showing the usual presentation of amounts from lowest to 
highest.  Since they are using a foreign card, Euronet knows that they are less familiar with the local currency. 
Scrambling the amounts in this way therefore influences them to take out much larger amounts than they would do 
otherwise.  This amount, now at least 10x what had been offered in local currency, is now subject to fees and 
currency spreads amount to up to more than 12% according to Lettner.  If the consumer rejects the DCC option 
and tries to have his own bank perform the conversion, Euronet issues a warning text and it then makes the 
customer reconfirm the decision.  The option of rejecting Euronet’s DCC option is on the left and in red, which is 
identical to “cancel” buttons on most ATM’s around the world. If the consumer initially selected DCC, no 
reconfirmation would be required and the transaction is processed immediately.  


Link:  https://chrislettner.com/with-or-without-conversion-how-to-avoid-hidden-fees-when-withdrawing-money-abroad/


To Quote Lettner: 


“It might not be a coincidence then that Euronet ATMs tend to congregate in the centers of cities where there are lots of 
tourists and visitors carrying foreign credit cards. They are rarely seen in the suburbs or smaller towns.  Euronet is also oddly 
persistent in getting customers to choose their exchange rates and in nudging them towards taking out as much money as 
possible.”


“Only when choosing ‘without conversion’ are you asked to confirm this choice. The warning reads “No Guarantee of Exchange 
Rate” making the option on the left sound dangerous. The button they don’t want you to press looks red making it look like 
‘cancel.’

Frame by Frame - Mapping Out the Steering Tactics Used by Euronet    


Local card: amounts offered to withdraw are very small.  


Foreign card: amounts offered up to 10x the normal size. Euronet then scrambles order of the amounts to confuse foreigners 
for whom local denominations are less intuitive.  


Euronet steers customers towards their DCC which costs the customers as much as 12-15% more.  Presentation make 
Euronet’s DCC appear to be the “safe” choice.  If consumer wisely declines DCC, then a warning screen pops up and requires 
reconfirmation. The reject DCC option appears on the left and in red, making it look like a “cancel” button. If the customer 
selects DCC first, no warning or reconfirmation is issued and the transaction is processed immediately.

European Tour Leader Site: “Eastern European countries are especially badly hit 
by Euronet scams”    
(Report dated: April 2017) 


The blog post shown below is dated April 30th, 2017. It can be found at the following link:  
https://travellingclaus.com/not-use-euronet-atms-travel/


In the author’s own words: 


“Euronet ATM’s do in many ways look like regular ATM’s, but there is a problem. The fees that are charged by Euronet and the 
exchange rates that are give are really really bad. It varies from country to country how they work. It all comes down to how
much they can get away with in each country. If a country has a weak consumer protection law, then they will often make you 
lose about 15% of your money in fees and bad exchange rates if you use them.”


“I have done some research and some of the eastern European countries are especially badly hit by Euronet scams. I am writing
these lines in Hungary, where they are everywhere. Not just at the ATM’s at the airport. Visiting Poland last month and did also 
notice them in many places there and noticed that the rates and fees there are terrible too.” 


“The company is not actually European as you might think. Euronet is from the small town Leawood in Kansas. The CEO is a 
guy called Michael J. Brown. He has roughly 5600 employees scamming holiday makers for a living. What a nice piece of shit he
is.”


“So if you are on holiday and need to draw money from your debit or credit card, then use the ATM’s that are inside regular 
banks. They are generally a lot more honest in dealing with this. There is no need to get ripped off by companies like this.”

Family Without Borders on Euronet: “In My Opinion This Is A Fraud And It 
Should Be Forbidden!”


Family without borders was not shy about calling Euronet’s ATM practices an outright “fraud” which “should be 
banned”.


He also explicitly describes fees including conversion) of around 10% (again direct contrast to the single digit 
assumptions of the sell side). 


As part of their article, FWB took screen shots specifically of Euronet’s ATM process and called it out as a “fraud”.  
Notice the Euronet logo in the upper right hand corner.


As with the previous authors above, FWB makes it clear that the only sensible decision is to select “without 
conversion”. He warns all of his readers to never select the “with conversion” option (i.e. they should never select 
the DCC option). 


And he goes further, making sure to warn his readers that once they make the sensible and intelligent decision 
that Euronet will actually warn them,  saying “Do you really want to do that ?”


If instead they had selected DCC, the transaction (and its hefty fee) is processed immediately with no need for a 
subsequent confirmation.

Just like the other numerous independent sources across Europe, FWB singles out Euronet very 
specifically and observes DCC fees of around 10% (vs. sell side estimates of 4-6%)

Celebrity Travel TV Host: “confuse customers by presenting DCC in misleading 
terms” 


“Guidebook author and travel TV host Rick Steves is America's most respected authority on European travel. In 
1976, he started his business, Rick Steves' Europe, which has grown from a one-man operation to a company 
with a staff of 100 full-time, well-travelled employees at his headquarters in Washington State. There he produces 
more than 50 guidebooks on European travel, America's most popular travel series on public television, a weekly 
hour-long national public radio show, a weekly syndicated column, and free travel information available through his 
travel center and ricksteves.com.”


Link: https://www.ricksteves.com/travel-tips/money/cash-machine-atm-tips


Here are the explicit instructions the Mr. Steves gives to his readers:


“Avoid "independent" ATMs, such as Travelex, Euronet, Moneybox, Cardpoint, and Cashzone. These have 
high fees and may try to trick users with "dynamic currency conversion." Note that these "independent" ATMs are 
often found next to bank ATMs in the hope that travelers will be too confused to notice the difference.”


As with each of the authors above, Rick Steves categorically instructs his readers that when at the ATM to “Avoid 
Dynamic Currency Conversion” in each and every case. 


Mr. Steves provides specific examples of independent ATM’s trying to confuse and mislead customers.  In proving 
his point, the language he cites comes straight from the Euronet ATM’s - same as the examples from previous 
authors above.  “If an ATM offers to “lock in” or “guarantee” your conversion rate, choose “proceed without 
conversion.” Other prompts might say “You can be charged in dollars: Press YES for dollars, NO for euros.” 
Always choose the local currency in these situations.”


Even the most novice travelers have long known: “never change money in the airport”.
Likewise, starting in 2017, the advice of “never use Dynamic Currency Conversion” is now going viral in 
mainstream travel sites across the US, Europe and Asia.

Holiday Leasing Company Article: “I cannot excuse Euronet for taking advantage 
of unsuspecting travelers.”
(May 2017) 


The following comes from the website of Cinque Terre Insider, who is also the owner of owner of Riomaggiore
Reservations (a holiday lettings agency in the Cinque Terre region of Italy).


Her posting has several features in common with the postings from the various other authors across different 
countries.  


First, she focuses very specifically on Euronet ATM’s (see photo).  


Second, she notes a fee of nearly 12% (in sharp contrast to the assumptions of American sell side analysts). 


Link: https://cinqueterreinsider.com/2017/05/07/beware-not-all-atms-are-created-equal/


In her own words: 


“Apparently Euronet pays a good chunk of change to business owners who simply place the ATM at their storefront: reportedly 
€400 per month plus a percentage of sales if a minimum threshold is reached.  It’s easy, hassle-free income (the machines are 
serviced and maintained by Euronet) and helps offset expensive rents and whatnot. I can understand why a business owner might
be swayed to host one of these ATMs but I cannot excuse Euronet for taking advantage of unsuspecting travelers.”


“I plan to update this post with photos and locations of bank ATMs in the other villages as well (each village, even teeny-tiny
Corniglia, has its own bank ATM), but I thought the most important thing was to get this information out there ASAP.”

SECTION III
How Did Wall Street Miss This ? 


Sell side coverage is dominated by individuals with little or no background in the space and no focus on European 
financial issues.


Their assumptions are often either overly vague or are (easily) provably downright wrong.


Vague speculation about a MoneyGram deal certainly does not justify the sharp price jump from $85.  


But the MoneyGram hype has fully distracted investors and analysts from the impending DCC developments.


Case Study: With Trip Advisor, Wall Street analysts entirely missed the growing consumer backlash that was 
easily visible in non financial media circles.


When consumer backlash spilled into the mainstream media, Trip Advisor quickly fell by 25% - losing over $1 
billion in market cap – even though there was no direct financial impact.


By contrast, the consumer backlash against Euronet will have a financial impact that is both very direct and  very 
significant.

First - Meet the Sell Side 


Sell side analysts have totally failed to see just how dependent Euronet is upon DCC.  They have also totally missed the 
swelling consumer rebellion against DCC (and specifically against Euronet). Likewise, despite multiple recent regulatory 
milestones and clear indications from EU sanctioned advocacy groups, the sell side has entirely dismissed the likelihood of a
disruption in DCC revenues. 


What we can see below is that the analysts here have made minimal effort to figure out what is really going on.  Their targets 
are all clustered very closely to one another.  And each time the stock rises, the analysts raise their targets according to the
Wall Street pricing model of “slightly above the prevailing share price”.  This is a strategy of “safety in numbers” because when 
they all put out identical targets then none of them looks risks looking like a foolish outlier regardless of where the stock goes.  


Goldman Sachs analyst Lara Fourman [LinkedIn] graduated from Yale in 2013 and focused on Gaming, Lodging and Leisure 
stocks for her first three years after graduation.  In December of 2017 (six weeks ago), she initiated coverage on Euronet and 
Western Union. These are the only two stocks she covers. 


We already saw that Piper simply describes DCC revenues as having margins “above 25%” when in actuality they are close to 
100%.   Again, this is a “playing it safe” strategy which adds precisely zero value to investors.  Piper also failed to notice the 
scathing articles and independent investigations unanimously condemning Euronet for its DCC practices. 


Northland actually did some actual work trying to calculate DCC contribution profitability.  But despite the very obvious issues
raised in Section II, Northland views Euronet as a transparent operator with little or no risk of losing DCC revenues.  


The only analyst to hedge his bet on Euronet was William Blair.  And yet despite his tacit acknowledgment of impending 
regulatory risk, he only downgraded the stock to a polite “market perform”.  Keep in mind that regardless of whether we see an 
outright ban or just forced transparency and disclosure on ATMs, either outcome results in a plunge in these high margins 
DCC revenues that amount to 30-40% of overall profits.

Enthusiasm Over MoneyGram Has Distracted Investors From DCC Developments 


On January 3rd, Euronet began a quick rise of 10 points from $85 to $95 when China’s Ant Financial was denied 
permission by the US to complete its acquisition of MoneyGram (MGI). 


Based on the continued strength in the stock, we can see that investors are now taking the following views on a 
potential deal between Euronet and MoneyGram. They are saying: 


• Certainty is high 
• Timing is fairly soon 
• Benefits are still substantial 


Yet even Euronet itself has warned that any potential deal with MoneyGram is speculative at best, both in certainty 
and timing. Any terms and benefits would be affected by the “significant developments disclosed by MoneyGram” 
in 2017. 


Developments include a new money laundering case which came to light in 2017 as well as the unexpected 
continuation by the DOJ of MoneyGram’s five year deferred prosecution agreement over its earlier 2012 fraud 
case.  That condition is now being dragged out by the DOJ into a sixth year. Euronet has now been making on and 
off overtures toward MoneyGram for 10 years without completion.  


If a deal does ever happen, the benefits are certain to be far less than had been originally hoped.  In March of 
2017, Euronet had bid $15.20 for MoneyGram. Even before the Ant deal fell apart, media sources had begun 
stating that, “Euronet is still interested in buying MoneyGram, but might now find it challenging to pay even $10 a 
share if the Ant sale falls through because of MoneyGram’s deteriorating financial health”.

Case Study: Why Trip Advisor Lost $1 Billion in Market Cap in November 2017 


In November 2017, shares of Trip Advisor fell by as much as 25%, shaving more than $1 billion off of its $6 billion 
market cap. The issue was a series of online postings by angry consumers which ended up finding their way into 
mainstream media.  One woman stated that she had placed postings on TripAdvisor.com to warn others about a 
hotel in Mexico where she had been sexually assaulted.  Trip Advisor reportedly deleted her postings stating that 
the language she had used violated the “family friendly” policies of the site.  Other individuals later came forward 
with similar stories about their deleted posts. These complaints were then picked up by national news media. 
Since that time, TripAdvisor stated that it has changed its policies, it has apologized to those users and it has 
restored those posts.  The company also implemented an online badge system by which it can identify hotels 
which have received serious safety complaints.


Shares of Trip Advisor have begun to climb back, but have still not recovered all of their losses from nearly three 
months ago. The loss of over $1 billion in market cap for Trip Advisor was all the more notable given the following 
facts:


• Aside from the highly visible bad PR, there was not a direct or immediate financial impact on Trip Advisor
• The underlying events happened as far back as 2010, so they were not in any way recent 
• The complaints from consumers had been circulating online for considerable time before they finally erupted 


into the public eye in November 2017, yet investors in TRIP were caught totally by surprise.


Consumer complaints about Euronet are being widely circulated in non stock market channels but have 
not yet been picked up by Wall Street. Events described are recent and ongoing. In contrast to 
TripAdvisor, the developments now affecting Euronet have a very visible near term financial impact which 
is both direct and very significant.

Section IV
Euronet’s Share Price Will See Disproportionate Downside 
on Any Disruption in DCC Revenues 


In terms of both EPS and EBITDA multiples, Euronet trades at a steep premium to peers due to continued 
expectations of strong growth.


As a result, any disappointment will see disproportionate downside to the share price .


There is a noticeable absence of “smart money” among Euronet’s shareholder base.


With the share price trading near all time highs, even recent earnings “beats” did not result in short term share 
price pops.

Historical Behavior Around Earnings Announcements 


Euronet consistently set low expectations for earnings and then delivers a slight beat. At lower share price 
levels, this resulted in moderate share price jumps of 4-7%.  But at the current lofty share price levels, even 
recent earnings beats resulted in minimal price jumps.

Appendix


What is Dynamic Currency Conversion (“DCC”) ?



mailto:info@moxreports.com

http://www.moxreports.com
·   info@moxreports.com ·   moxreports.com30


What is Dynamic Currency Conversion (“DCC”) ? 


When a consumer withdraws money or makes a purchase in a foreign country and when that transaction is not 
denominated in the consumer’s home currency, then someone must perform the currency conversion. Currently, 
conversion can either be done by the consumer’s home bank in their home country, or it can by the on site 
ATM/POS operator (such as Euronet).  


When conversion is performed by the ATM/POS operator (i.e. Euronet), it is called Dynamic Currency Conversion 
(“DCC”).  Under DCC, the ATM/POS operator locks in a rate of exchange at the time of the transaction, and then 
charges the consumers bank account in their original home currency. As far as their home bank sees, this is just 
an ordinary charge in their usual home currency. Note that under DCC, any exchange rate differential is separate 
and in addition to any flat transaction fee that might be charged by ether the home bank or the ATM/POS operator.  
So even if a consumer has a “no international fee” arrangement with their home bank, they will still end up paying 
whatever spread that the ATM/POS operator wishes to charge. In addition, the consumer may not even see what 
that real cost was (expressed in their home currency) until weeks later when they receive their monthly statement 
from their home bank.  


On the other hand, if the consumer foregoes DCC (opting for their home bank to perform the conversion) then the 
consumer may not know the precise exchange rate until the transaction is processed by their home bank, which 
may occur perhaps hours or days later.  The only argument for DCC is that it protects consumers from currency 
moves during those few hours or days.  In exchange for that “protection” consumers unwittingly end up paying as 
much as 12-15% to operators such as Euronet.  


Independent ATM/POS operators (in particular Euronet, specifically) have begun to draw significant negative 
attention over the past year for what are deemed to be highly abusive (even “fraudulent”) tactics by which they 
aggressively and persistently steer unwitting customers into DCC. The operators then use additional tactics to 
encourage much larger withdrawals, which are then subject to the sky high fees (via the exchange differential 
charged).  Only later do these consumers find out that they have been charged fees of up to 12-15%, often in 
excess of €100. It is often the case that their home bank would have charged them little (or even nothing) for the 
same transaction, had they not been steered into selecting DCC.  


What we will see below is that consumers are now widely accusing ATM/POS operators of outright fraud. The 
biggest brunt of this public criticism appears to be directed squarely at Euronet, quite specifically.  


Multiple consumer advocate groups based in Brussels and elsewhere have now conducted independent 
investigations, finding that DCC is entirely predatory and without any value for consumers.  Multiple organizations 
are now very vocally and specifically calling for an outright ban against operators such as Euronet even offering 
DCC.
