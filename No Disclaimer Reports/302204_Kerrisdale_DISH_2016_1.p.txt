In our previous reports on Globalstar and Straight Path, we challenged the market’s complacent 


belief that spectrum prices can only go up and that wireless carriers have a desperate, 


boundless need for ever more megahertz. The most influential promoter of this bogus notion – 


with tens of billions of dollars riding on its veracity – is DISH Network. Since 2008, DISH has 


accumulated a massive portfolio of spectrum licenses and convinced investors that, any day 


now, it would unveil a brilliant strategy to extract value from these assets, even as evidence 


mounted that no major counterparty was interested in paying DISH’s price. 





Now, with an imminent new spectrum auction promising to drastically reduce benchmark price 


expectations, DISH is in the weakest position it’s been in for years: sitting on a warehouse full of 


overpriced inventory, devoid of interested customers, and – with regulatory deadlines looming – 


running out of time. Meanwhile, DISH’s core pay-TV business is likewise entering dire straits, 


with declining subscribers, strengthened competitors, and obvious secular problems only 


beginning to manifest. Overall, we believe that the fair value of DISH’s equity is 58% lower than 


the current stock price – and, in a reasonable downside scenario, more than 80% lower. 





Scrappy and entrepreneurial, DISH has always prided itself on its willingness to take outsized 


risks; as its founder, chairman, and CEO Charlie Ergen – a former professional gambler – said 


in 2005, “I like to bet a few hands and bet them big.” After achieving great success building the 


second-largest satellite-TV operator in the US, DISH has watched its earnings flatline for a 


decade, a victim of consumers’ growing array of entertainment choices and the rising 


importance of broadband internet connections, which cable and phone companies can offer but 


DISH largely cannot. Casting about for a way out of this strategic morass, DISH hit upon 


wireless spectrum. 





Initially focused on the concept of a mobile TV service, DISH’s spectrum ambitions have 


become grander yet vaguer over time, with empty talk of “multiple options” taking the place of a 


concrete plan. But as DISH has continued to bet big on this single hand – culminating in its 


widely criticized hijacking of the previous AWS-3 spectrum auction, which earned it the ire of the 


FCC, Congress, and the wireless industry – it hasn’t noticed that the other players have stepped 


away from the game. Already armed with large reserves of un- and under-utilized spectrum, 


combined with better options for cheap capacity enhancement in congested areas, major 


carriers like AT&T and Verizon now gain less and less from incremental bandwidth – a simple 


case of diminishing marginal returns. DISH may put on a show of confidence, but carriers are 


calling its bluff, and DISH shareholders will learn that sometimes, when you bet big, you lose.

Carriers have plenty of spectrum already. DISH bulls generally buy into the notion that 


spectrum is extraordinarily scarce and cellular data consumption is relentlessly skyrocketing. 


However, even if these beliefs were true, it would not necessarily imply that spectrum prices 


should be high and rising. After all, the revenue generated by using that spectrum to provide 


wireless service grew relatively slowly for years, declined in 2014 for the first time ever,1 and 


declined again in 2015.2 Fierce competition has kept a lid on what users pay, while better 


devices have increased the scope of the demands they place on networks. Thus it might take 


twice as much spectrum to satisfy a $60-per-month customer today as it did a few years ago –  


implying that that the profitability of a fixed unit of spectrum is falling, not rising. It takes more 


input to produce the same economic output, so the input is worth less. 





Moreover, the scarcity of spectrum is vastly overstated. Consider, for instance, Verizon – the 


largest carrier in the US and the most frequently rumored counterparty for DISH. As of the first 


quarter of 2016, the vast majority of Verizon’s data traffic (92%3) ran over its LTE network. But 


though Verizon holds, on average, 114 MHz of spectrum nationwide, its LTE network uses only

half that.4 The rest of the spectrum is either totally unused (newly purchased AWS-3 spectrum) 


or still largely devoted to inefficient legacy technologies like CDMA. Over time – indeed, more 


quickly than previously expected given the rapid uptake of LTE-capable devices – this under-


utilized spectrum will be deployed for LTE, effectively doubling the amount of traffic Verizon can 


handle. A similar story is unfolding for the other carriers as well. As T-Mobile’s chief technology 


officer put it,5  





But probably, the biggest thing to think about is – [let me] do rough math for you. Half 


our network – just over half our network today is LTE, in terms of the spectrum that we 


own. So half our spectrum is on the LTE technology. And that covers almost 90% of our 


data.…So when you look at the other half of the spectrum and what it's doing, it's not 


doing that much. 





Meanwhile, AT&T, for its part, is beginning to roll out 40 MHz of virgin LTE spectrum nationwide 


– approximately doubling its capacity even before taking into account its large reserve of under-


utilized spectrum, which it’s also gradually shifting to LTE (a process sometimes called 


“refarming”).

generations of technology are also more spectrally efficient – that is, they can transmit greater

quantities of data using the same exact bandwidth. (One approach, called higher-order MIMO, 


is to increase the number of coordinated antennas serving a given cell.) In a report prepared for 


Ofcom, the British equivalent of the FCC, the telecom consultancy Analysys Mason estimated 


that, thanks to better technology, LTE spectral efficiency would approximately double over the 


next five years, thereby doubling network capacity without requiring any new spectrum. 





All this fails to even consider the most important way that networks have added capacity in the 


past: more cell sites. Indeed, American Tower, one of the nation’s largest tower companies, has 


estimated that, over the last few years, only 20-30% of the gains in cellular capacity have come 


from more spectrum and higher spectral efficiency, while all the rest has come from new cell 


sites and more radio equipment.6 While putting up new, full-fledged towers is difficult in some 


locations, carriers today can be surgical, deploying sites only where needed to relieve local 


congestion and making greater use of cheap small cells. Free and low-cost spectrum in the 


5GHz and 3.5GHz bands will also play a role in addressing traffic hot spots – without requiring 


conventional, exclusively licensed frequencies. 





Spectrum bulls might contend that even quintupling effective capacity won’t satisfy consumer 


demand, but they overestimate just how close today’s networks are to their limits. According to 


the market-research firm NPD Group, the average smartphone user consumes about 3 


gigabytes per month (though the distribution is highly skewed – median usage is only ~1 


gigabyte). Three gigabytes per month equates to just 0.009 megabits per second – or, 


assuming that 10% of a day’s usage occurs during the peak hour, just 0.02 megabits per 


second at peak. By contrast, average LTE throughput in the US is approximately 10 megabits 


per second, highlighting the large gap – on average – between what users actually do with their 


devices and what their networks are truly capable of. To be sure, data consumption has grown 


over time, but some evidence suggests that this growth is already plateauing: Verizon, for 


example, has seen traffic growth decelerate sharply over the past several quarters (from 75% to 


40%), while NDP Group’s detailed analysis (based on tracking individual users’ behavior 


patterns) suggests that average consumption has been flat in recent months – a far cry from the 


facile assumption of an endless hockey stick. 





Against this backdrop of underutilized spectrum, growing efficiency, improving infrastructure, 


and potentially plateauing demand, it’s no wonder that wireless-industry insiders regard 


sensationalistic claims that carriers are on the verge of “running out of spectrum” as utter 


nonsense. But this dynamic puts DISH in a far worse bargaining position than its supporters 


appreciate. While they believe that DISH’s spectrum portfolio is a near-term must-have for 


bandwidth-starved carriers, the reality is that carriers are well-equipped to simply wait DISH out 


and let it squirm. 





Spectrum prices should reset dramatically lower. Much has been written about DISH’s 


cunning, disruptive bidding in the AWS-3 spectrum auction that ended in 2015; FCC Chairman 


Tom Wheeler reportedly said from the beginning that the company’s actions “didn’t smell right.”

Bidding against itself by way of three separate legal entities, DISH successfully drove prices far 


above expectations, and investors dutifully applied those distorted prices to the rest of DISH’s 


portfolio. 





However, as the 600MHz auction, beginning at the end of the month, approaches, DISH faces a 


very different situation. Already highly levered, it lacks the financial firepower to have a large 


impact on prices, and, after getting into hot water for its complex bidding by proxy, it’s unlikely to 


try a similar approach again. Meanwhile, carriers’ balance sheets also show the strain of the 


previous auction, and Sprint – the fourth-largest carrier and arguably the one most in need of 


low-band spectrum like the 600MHz band – is not even participating. As a result, the 30 MHz of 


spectrum reserved exclusively for bidding by carriers with modest low-band holdings will likely 


go in large part to T-Mobile, leaving the rest of the auctioned-off spectrum for AT&T and 


Verizon. While the total amount of available spectrum is uncertain (subject to participation by TV 


broadcasters opting to cash out), AT&T has expressed interest in only 20 MHz. If Verizon seeks 


a similar quantity, then that amounts to around 60 MHz of baseline spectrum demand among 


the three major carriers – compared to expected supply of 100 MHz from the broadcasters. 


Thus competition is likely to be subdued, with enough wiggle room to accommodate new 


entrants as well. No one has a good reason to bid aggressively.7 Therefore we expect the 


average auction clearing price to end up close to the reserve level of $1.25 per MHz-pop. Here 


we assume $1.50 – a 45% decline from the inflated AWS-3 results.8 





This type of outcome has rapidly become the consensus expectation. Recently Bloomberg 


reported that the 600MHz auction “may yield a lot less than anticipated,” summarizing analysts’ 


views that carriers “simply don’t have the war chests to bid up” for bandwidth. Wireless Week 


echoed these comments. But few have fully considered the ugly consequences for DISH. Not 


only is the 600MHz auction going to reset all spectrum prices downward; the fallout is also likely 


to cost DISH billions of dollars in regulatory penalties. 





Why? If 600MHz spectrum goes for ~$1.50/MHz-pop, then DISH’s most commercially viable 


holdings – the AWS-3 licenses purchased in the previous auction – must be worth far less, 


given their ~3x higher frequency and attendant weaker propagation. While the superior 


coverage provided by low-band spectrum has become less important over time, especially for 


carriers like Verizon and AT&T who have already achieved strong coverage, the fact remains 


that low-band is still more valuable, and recent precedent transactions point to 2-3x higher 


prices for low-band relative to mid-band (like AWS). But, after partially defaulting on auction-


related payments and walking away from many spectrum licenses for which it was the winning 


bidder, DISH is now on the hook to the FCC for the difference between the pumped-up prices it 


bid and the proceeds of a future repeat auction. If average prices step down from an inflated 


~$2.70 to a more reasonable ~$0.75, DISH’s make-whole liability will balloon. 





                                                
7 Of course, DISH might choose to bid irrationally, perhaps hoping to drop out at the last minute and thus 


conserve its cash, but in so doing it would just be digging itself a deeper hole.

Meanwhile, DISH’s more “boutique” spectrum holdings have their own problems. Not used by 


any carrier, they lack an ecosystem of handsets and equipment to give them value – something 


that likely only Verizon or AT&T have the clout to provide. But when the carrier holds the cards, 


the carrier extracts most of the value, resulting in very low prices for unusual bands (like the 


~$0.30/MHz-pop that AT&T paid for NextWave’s WCS spectrum and Sprint paid for Clearwire’s 


EBS/BRS spectrum). To varying degrees, DISH’s AWS-4, AWS-3 unpaired uplink, H Block, and 


700MHz E Block holdings all suffer from this crucial problem. Even if DISH can ultimately entice 


a carrier or carriers to buy or lease all of its spectrum, we estimate that its intrinsic value is a 


small fraction of what the market currently believes it is. 





Breakdown of DISH’s Spectrum Portfolio by 
Band and Kerrisdale-Estimated Value 





Source: company filings, Kerrisdale analysis 





Time is not on DISH’s side. Making matters worse, DISH can’t simply wait around for carriers 


to some day exhaust their existing spectral resources; it faces strict build-out deadlines imposed 


by the FCC. For instance, within four years DISH needs to demonstrate AWS-4 signal coverage 


and service for 70% of the US population; otherwise, it automatically loses its licenses.9 With no 


network of cell sites to provide such service, and with the major carriers busy for the 


foreseeable future deploying the spectrum they already have (and will win in the 600MHz 


auction), DISH does not have the luxury of playing “hard to get.” It needs a partner as soon as 


possible – a fact that every plausible partner is well aware of and won’t hesitate to use against 


DISH. 





Indeed, while we do expect a deal to ultimately materialize, investors must take seriously the 


risk that DISH can’t find a partner in time and simply loses its non-standard spectrum. After all, 


while all the carriers will be deploying AWS-3, no one but DISH has any stake in the success of, 


say, the H Block, and altering existing plans to incorporate such a band takes time, money, and

effort. Why not just wait for DISH to lose the spectrum, then pick it up as needed down the road 


when the FCC puts it back on the market?  





DISH’s core TV business also faces grave threats. For years, satellite TV has been a 


reliable, if stagnant, source of cash for DISH, funding its great spectrum adventure. But with 


over-the-top entertainment ascendant and satellite-market leader DirecTV gaining strength from 


its merger with AT&T, DISH is beginning to shed core subscribers. As content costs continue to 


rise and DISH’s already lean structure makes it difficult to cut expenses, we estimate that a 


further 10% subscriber loss could reduce EBITDA by 26%, potentially jeopardizing the solvency 


of DISH’s satellite subsidiary. While some pin their hopes on DISH’s own over-the-top offering, 


Sling TV, early indications suggest that the product is riddled with bugs and already losing 


steam, leading to recent headlines like “Is Sling TV a Failure?” In short, DISH’s weak TV 


business can’t make up for its disastrous spectrum gamble.

integrated bundles of TV and other higher-margin services like broadband internet access, 


DISH is largely limited to TV. (Its expensive satellite-delivered broadband service is a niche 


business aimed at those with no better alternatives; as the company itself says, “If you live in an 


area where cable or fiber Internet is already available, then satellite Internet service may not be 


your best option.”) In recent years, it has become clear that satellite TV is a mature business, 


with no meaningful growth in subscribers or earnings power; the modest revenue growth that 


DISH has achieved via price hikes has been overwhelmed by margin contraction.

In light of this performance – and the ongoing competitive pressures discussed further below –  


it’s no wonder that even bullish sell-side firms (including Deutsche Bank and Jefferies) value 


DISH’s pay-TV business at modest EV/EBITDA multiples of 4-5x. The fixed-income market has 


also become more pessimistic about the health of the business (which DISH has heavily 


borrowed against to fund its spectrum purchases): in recent months, the CDS spreads for 


DISH’s satellite subsidiary have blown out, signaling deteriorating credit.

DISH management, well aware that the days of rapid satellite-TV growth were over, made its 


first major terrestrial spectrum purchase in 2008, spending $712 million at auction on 700MHz E 


Block licenses across much of the country. Qualcomm used similar spectrum to offer a mobile 


TV service called MediaFLO (a flop that it abandoned in 2010), and DISH originally indicated 


that its own “mobile video product” was on its way.11 Instead, the spectrum has lain fallow for 


years. In 2012 DISH went on to purchase the assets of the bankrupt satellite firms TerreStar 


and DBSD and gained FCC approval to convert their nationwide spectrum from satellite to 


terrestrial usage; this spectrum is now known as the AWS-4 band. In 2013, DISH tried to 


purchase both Sprint and Clearwire but failed – perhaps a lucky break, since Sprint, having itself 


absorbed Clearwire, now trades for 50% less than what DISH was willing to pay three years 


ago. In 2014, DISH bought up a chunk of mid-band spectrum called the H Block in an FCC 


auction (at exactly the minimum price it guaranteed it would pay in exchange for certain 


regulatory favors – thus implying that the undistorted intrinsic value was less than it paid).  





DISH’s first three cellular spectrum purchases – 700MHz E Block, AWS-4, and H Block – had at 


least the appearance of value investments: non-standard “fixer-upper” bands purchased at 


optically low prices. For all DISH’s posturing about possibly entering the wireless market itself 


as a fifth major carrier, its far more attractive option has long been to sell or lease its spectrum 


to the incumbents – cashing in, or so the theory went, on the difference between its “bargain” 


purchase prices and the prevailing market level. In 2014, however, according to the Financial 


Times, DISH discovered that it didn’t see eye to eye with its would-be counterparties:

Bankers say Verizon tried to buy spectrum from Mr Ergen last year, but balked at the 


$1.50 per MHz/pop he was asking for. “They thought it was ridiculously expensive and 


let it get away from them…” says a person familiar with the deal. Nor is there any 


certainty that the regulator [the FCC] would let Dish sell to Verizon.12 





Having already sunk more than $4 billion into spectrum, only to be told that its price 


expectations were “ridiculously” excessive, DISH shifted its investment style from value to 


momentum. In the AWS-3 auction, it chased rising spectrum prices to unprecedented new 


heights, ultimately spending another $10 billion while straining the carriers’ capital budgets. 


DISH’s approach mirrored the strategy it used some 20 years earlier in the auction of a 


broadcast-satellite orbital slot, for which DISH, MCI, and TCI (John Malone’s cable company) 


were the only bidders. There, too, the price rapidly rose to seemingly irrational levels, but Ergen 


kept bidding higher. He later explained: 





If we got the slot, we had a satellite under construction that we could have used it for. If 


we didn’t, we raised the price of poker for somebody else and made our spectrum that 


much more valuable.13 





In the AWS-3 auction, like the earlier slot auction, DISH’s bidding did indeed “raise the price of 


poker” for its rivals, but the other elements of the analogy didn’t apply. DISH lacks the 


equivalent of “a satellite under construction”: it has no wireless network to actually allow it to use 


all the spectrum it has accumulated and thus has no choice but to partner. Moreover, while the 


AWS-3 auction generated a lot of analyst notes slapping higher prices on DISH’s previous 


spectrum holdings, it didn’t actually make them more valuable. If anything, it made them less 


valuable: post-auction, the carriers had more spectrum and less money, reducing their need for 


incremental bandwidth as well as their ability to pay. (When you stretch your finances to buy an 


expensive house, it doesn’t make you more likely to pay a higher price for another one; for one 


thing, you already have a house, and, for another, you’re out of cash.)  





Now, highly levered and sitting on a mountain of unused spectrum, DISH still has no clear plan 


for monetizing its investments. Rumors of an imminent transaction have come and gone, but the 


carriers have continued to prove unwilling to meet the company’s terms. For those who have 


bought into the narrative of an ongoing spectrum crunch, this deadlock ought to inspire 


confusion. With spectrum values endlessly rising, with bandwidth in such short supply, why will 


no one cut a deal? In reality, though, the absence of a deal is just one of a number of data 


points demonstrating that the much vaunted spectrum crunch is far less than advertised – 


deeply undermining the foundations of DISH’s all-in bet. 





                                                
12 The same “person familiar with the deal” also contended that Verizon would come to regret its balking, 


though whether that is true remains to be seen.

III. Carriers Already Have Plenty of Spectrum 





What’s so great about spectrum? Licensed spectrum, along with towers, antennas, and 


specialized computers, are key components of cellular networks. But what’s so great about 


cellular networks? From a financial perspective, network operators have historically achieved 


only modest returns on all the capital they need to meet user demands. In 2015, for instance, 


carriers achieved a weighted-average return on invested capital of just 9%, with especially 


anemic results from T-Mobile and Sprint. 





US Wireless Carriers: 
Returns on Capital, 2015 





Source: Capital IQ, Kerrisdale analysis 





The industry’s mediocre profitability not only makes it foolhardy for a new player to aggressively 


enter the market; it also calls into question the rationality of paying ever higher prices for 


spectrum. When an entire network can only generate a single-digit return on capital, there is a 


limit to how valuable a single input to that network can be, especially at the margin. Verizon’s 


existing spectrum portfolio is indeed very valuable because it enables Verizon to support its 


massive customer base, but incremental spectrum is naturally far less valuable, especially when 


the network is already in good working order.  





In the wake of the AWS-3 auction, all the carriers stated repeatedly that their existing spectrum 


portfolios, combined with improving technology and the deployment of additional infrastructure, 


were well-equipped to handle growing data traffic for years to come. That would imply relatively 


little interest in investing even more in additional spectrum – bad news for a spectrum 


speculator like DISH, especially given the practical difficulties of using its non-standard bands. 


Spectrum bulls, of course, discount the notion that existing spectrum supply is adequate as self-


serving deception: the carriers don’t want the world to know how badly they need more 


spectrum and how much they’d be willing to pay for DISH’s, so they need to insist that all is well. 


It’s just an act – or so the bulls have argued. 





But this conspiracy theory doesn’t hold up to scrutiny. In a world where carriers were rapidly 


exhausting their spectrum resources, there would be clear evidence of mounting trouble on 


many fronts:

 Network performance would rapidly deteriorate as traffic overwhelmed the available 


capacity. Dissatisfied users would leave in droves. 


 Not only would carriers buy all the spectrum they could; they’d also ramp up spending on 


new cell sites and network equipment to increase capacity. 


 To tamp down demand, carriers would discourage data-intensive use cases like 


streaming video. 





But this is not the world we live in: 





 On average, network performance is getting better. According to OpenSignal, every 


major carrier has improved its LTE download speeds over the past year, in some cases 


substantially. (Ookla, the maker of Speedtest.net, reports average overall speeds that 


are ~50-75% higher, suggesting that OpenSignal’s figure might be conservative.)

 Despite their intense competition, carriers boast low and fairly stable churn rates. If 


anything, churn is trending down, not up. There is no sign of any mass exodus driven by 


a shortage of spectrum.

 Meanwhile, according to our estimates, Verizon, from 2012 to the time of the AWS-3 


auction in 2015, was actually a net seller of spectrum.14 


 The H Block auction, which DISH easily won, attracted no interest from the carriers.  


 In the AWS-3 auction, the very fact that DISH was able to outbid the carriers for so many 


licenses points to real price sensitivity: Verizon and AT&T could have paid as much as 


DISH but opted not to. 


 Even DISH chose to forfeit a host of AWS-3 licenses rather than pay full price once it 


learned that its “very small business” bidding credits were being revoked. Evidently it 


does not believe there is much margin of safety in spectrum at auction prices. 


 Spending on new cell sites and equipment is not exploding; it’s business as usual.  


 For instance, Crown Castle, essentially tied for largest tower operator in the country, has 


seen its tower count go from 39,697 at the end of 2014 to 39,749 at 3/31/16, and the 


average number of tenants per tower has actually dipped slightly from 2.3 to 2.2. 


American Tower, Crown Castle’s major competitor, has increased its tower count 


recently, but almost entirely through acquisition; its organic rate of new builds is only 


~0.3%, and its average number of tenants per tower has been flat.15 There is no frenzied 


race to build more sites, contrary to the predictions of the “spectrum crunch” theory. 


 Major telecom vendors like Ericsson and Nokia are actually suffering from sluggish 


revenues in the US, as carriers “focus on cash flow optimization”16 after the completion 


of major LTE roll-outs. Spending is restrained, not booming. 


 Similarly, carrier capital expenditures, though large in absolute terms, are only growing 


modestly, not rapidly:

 Far from discouraging data-intensive video consumption, several major carriers have 


recently begun to promote it. T-Mobile’s “Binge On” feature allows subscribers to stream 


unlimited amounts of video (at 480p+ quality) without touching their data allocations. 


Verizon has rolled out its own over-the-top streaming video service, Go90. AT&T has 


reintroduced unlimited data plans for mobile users who also subscribe to DirecTV and 


has hinted at a future OTT product. If these carriers were running out of spectrum and 


network capacity, why would they possibly roll out these sorts of offers? It would be 


suicide. Yet there they are.  





In sum, the notion of an impending spectrum crunch that would put carriers urgently in need of 


DISH’s spectrum is belied by the evidence.  Network performance is improving, customers are 


satisfied, infrastructure deployment is slow and steady, and carriers have not been shy about 


encouraging increased user traffic – a signal of confidence in their networks. Because there is 


no crisis, carriers can easily afford to let DISH twist in the wind – as indeed they have done for 


years. 





Spectrum bulls, however, tend to ignore all these indications that networks are doing a good job 


accommodating growing traffic; instead, they focus on the sheer magnitude of that traffic growth 


and assume it must ultimately overwhelm the carriers’ spectrum supplies. To be sure, cellular 


data consumption has increased tremendously as smartphones, LTE, and streaming video have 


become almost universal. But most observers fail to appreciate just how little the average user 


consumes relative to available throughput. Different sources provide different figures, but the 


NPD Group, based on a panel of smartphone users with specialized metering software installed 


on their devices, estimates median and average cellular data consumption of ~1 and ~3 


gigabytes per month, respectively. (The large difference between the median and average 


highlights the outsized impact of a small group of heavy users.) Those monthly consumption 


numbers translate to just 0.003 and 0.009 megabits per second – a tiny fraction of the >10 


megabits per second that many users achieve in speed tests. Consumption has grown, but 


existing networks are capable of much more. 





One important factor in allowing for all this spare capacity is the relatively low population density 


of most parts of the countries. As American Tower has pointed out, 84% of the US population 


lives in suburban and rural areas with typical population densities in the hundreds per square 


kilometer. Consider a stylized example. Business Insider has ranked New Albany, Ohio, as the 


best suburb in America; its population density is 258 per square kilometer. (The average for the 


contiguous United States is 40.) Assuming a typical tower coverage radius of 2.5km, a single 


cell tower could cover ~20 km² containing ~5,000 people; further assuming that a single carrier 


has 35% market share in the area (similar to what Verizon and AT&T boast nationwide), it would 





management comments from AT&T’s 2015 Q4 earnings calls, that wireless capex accounts for about half 


of AT&T’s total, then wireless-specific capex for the four carriers totaled ~$30.4 billion, ~$30.2 billion, and 


~$31.5 billion in 2013, 2014, and 2015, respectively, for a 2013-15 CAGR of 2%.

have to handle only ~1,800 users.18 At a usage rage of 3 GB/month/user, the tower would see 


177 GB of average daily traffic.  





How does that stack up against the site’s capacity? Assuming only 10 MHz of downlink 


bandwidth, three sectors, and 1.5 bps/Hz/sector of average spectral efficiency, the site’s 


capacity would be 45 Mbps or 486 GB per day. In other words, even with a small amount of 


spectrum, the site would use only 36% of its capacity. Traffic could almost triple without 


requiring a major overhaul. With 25 MHz of downlink spectrum – more typical of metro-area LTE 


networks – traffic could grow almost seven-fold without exhausting existing resources. The table 


below summarizes this calculation. 





Illustrative Analysis of Cell-Site Capacity Utilization

Of course, all of these parameter settings will differ from market to market and carrier to carrier, 


but this simplified example helps to explain why carriers are not behaving like their spectrum is 


running out any time soon: it’s not. In large swaths of the country in which most customers live, 


even small amounts of spectrum can go a long way. 





                                                
18 At 3/31/16, Verizon had ~90 million retail postpaid smartphones and ~40-60k cell sites (depending in 


part on how one counts DAS nodes and small cells), for an average of 1,500 to 2,200 smartphones per 


site, roughly consistent with the calculation above. Other carriers serve fewer devices but operate a 


similar number of sites.

Furthermore, the 10-25 MHz of downlink spectrum deployed for LTE today will become ~50 in 


the years to come, creating even more headroom for traffic growth. The table below 


summarizes the average bandwidth held by the large carriers – but the majority of this 


bandwidth still supports pre-LTE technologies and voice calls. As carriers “refarm” non-LTE 


spectrum and convert it to LTE – a process already well underway in many areas – a 


tremendous amount of additional latent capacity will be unlocked.

Whether all this capacity will actually be necessary any time soon is also less clear-cut than 


spectrum bulls believe. Consider, for instance, the CTIA’s statistics on average smartphone 


data consumption.19 From 2010 to 2014, it grew five-fold – a staggering amount. Yet the growth 


rate has steadily declined during that whole period, from 90% to just 18%:

Data from a different source, NPD Group, suggests, even more starkly, that growth in monthly 


traffic has recently stopped altogether. From January to November 2015, it has averaged ~3 GB 


month in and month out. While it would be no great surprise if this were only a temporary 


plateau, even that would be drastically at odds with the spectrum bulls’ bedrock assumption of 


never-ending traffic growth – a critical tenet of the DISH investment thesis.

To be sure, in certain urban markets, where population density can be orders of magnitude 


higher than it is in the country’s “best suburb,” capacity is harder to come by. Power levels need 


to be lower, cells need to shrink, and congested “hot spots” can certainly arise. But more 


spectrum is not necessarily the most economically effective solution. Additional infrastructure in 


the form of small cells and DAS nodes (installed, for instance, on lampposts or utility poles 


outdoors or in the ceiling in large office buildings) can enhance spectral efficiency by putting 


radios closer to users, thereby increasing signal-to-noise ratios and enabling more data to flow 


over the same amount of spectrum. That’s the strategy Verizon is now aggressively pursuing in 


lieu of bidding up spectrum to irrational levels. As Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said in November 


at an investor conference: 





[W]e went into the AWS-3 auction; we spent $10.4 billion. If I wanted more spectrum, I 


would have bought it in the auction. What we did was, we walked away from Chicago 


and New York, because we said the price got way too high. And if you look at just the 


math at a very simple level, in order to buy New York and Chicago and a couple other 


markets, it was $6 billion additional cost for spectrum. I can build the same capacity for 


$1.5 billion. The spectrum won't be launched until three years from now, so 2018. My 


build will be done by 2018. I'll have the exact amount of capacity I would have had if I 


bought that spectrum. So from our perspective, $1.5 billion versus $6 billion, it's a pretty 


simple equation. 





So, why would I go out and buy spectrum and be held hostage by a third party? I mean, 


it makes no logical sense to do that. So, at this point, yeah, Charlie has great spectrum, 


but not at the price that he paid for it, because we walked away in the auction. So,

there's no reason to have this discussion, and we've talked about this before. I'm not 


interested in DISH.20 





Predictably, DISH bulls dismissed this straightforward rejection as pure hot air. But the evidence 


reviewed above is consistent with Shammo’s argument. Today, all the carriers have large 


amounts of under-utilized and virgin spectrum, typical traffic demands are putting little strain on 


network capacity in most places, and traffic growth is decelerating. More spectrum never hurts, 


but carriers don’t earn outsized economic returns, and spectrum, like most resources, suffers 


from diminishing marginal returns, so carriers have neither the ability nor the willingness to pay 


ever higher prices. While the skewed results of the AWS-3 auction temporarily obscured these 


realities, we believe that the upcoming 600MHz auction will put them on display, casting 


additional doubt on the sustainability of DISH’s inflated valuation. 





IV. Spectrum Prices Face a Major Reset Downward – 


Especially for DISH 





The 600MHz incentive auction, already underway, will serve to put low-frequency spectrum 


currently used by traditional TV broadcasters into the hands of carriers. First, in the “reverse” 


auction, TV stations will be able to accept cash payments in exchange for going off the air and 


freeing up spectrum, while holdouts will be “repacked” into new frequencies. In the “forward” 


auction, carriers (along with would-be new entrants and speculators like DISH) will bid for 


cellular licenses carved out of the freed-up spectrum. Many aspects of the auction are complex, 


uncertain, and inter-dependent; for example, the amount of spectrum available to carriers is a 


function of broadcaster participation (and will vary somewhat from market to market). For our 


purposes, however, the most important point about the auction is the imbalance between likely 


supply and likely demand. 





Though TV broadcasters located in major markets with major network affiliations (like CBS or 


ABC) may have viable business models, there are well over a thousand broadcasters in the 


country, many of which lack those attributes, have no clear future, and are likely to cash out. 


While the auction could release anywhere from 20 to 100 MHz of spectrum (in multiples of 10) 


for cellular use, FCC simulations suggest that, even with minimal participation from major-


network and other high-value stations, 70 to 100 MHz of paired spectrum represents a likely 


range of outcomes; indeed, the FCC’s initial clearing target is 100 MHz, the highest possible. By 


contrast, the AWS-3 auction offered only 50 MHz of paired spectrum. In short, given the large 


number of weak broadcasters for whom going off the air is financially superior to the status quo, 


the auction should generate a very large supply of spectrum.

Meanwhile, there are only four large carriers, and the one with perhaps the worst position in 


low-band spectrum, Sprint, announced last year that it wouldn’t even be bidding, noting, among 


other things, that “Sprint has the spectrum it needs.” T-Mobile, notwithstanding its recent 


accumulation of 700MHz A Block licenses, still suffers from a coverage and building-penetration 


disadvantage relative to AT&T and Verizon, and the company has been vocal about its interest 


in buying 600MHz spectrum. But the auction will include a spectrum reserve of 30 MHz for 


carriers without a strong pre-existing portfolio of low-band spectrum in a given market. In some 


areas, AT&T and Verizon lack the threshold level of low-band spectrum and will be able to bid 


against T-Mobile, but in large regions T-Mobile will essentially have the reserve to itself. Since 


the auction reserve price is $1.25/MHz-pop,21 T-Mobile won’t be able to get away with an 


incredible bargain, and it has stated that it’s “certainly not going to buy 30 MHz of spectrum at 


the auction.” But it’s plausible that it will be able to pick up ~20 MHz nationwide at ~$1.50/MHz-


pop, for total spending of approximately $9 billion – consistent with management’s remarks that 


it could spend “up to” $10 billion.  





If T-Mobile only buys 20 MHz, though, that leaves 50 to 80 MHz for AT&T and Verizon – large 


quantities relative to their current holdings. But both already have strong 700MHz portfolios, 


giving them good coverage; at the margin, 600MHz spectrum is less valuable to them than it is 


to T-Mobile. Still, 600MHz base stations operating at reduced power can, in principle, provide 


the same sort of capacity and cell size that mid-band spectrum can, while not foregoing the 


option of broader coverage where needed. Thus, even with the rising importance of mid-band 


spectrum, low-band spectrum is still more valuable. Yet AT&T has said that it’s only looking for 


a 20MHz slice. If Verizon seeks the same, that would amount to just 40 MHz of demand outside 


the protected spectrum reserve, as compared to 50 to 80 MHz of supply. The carriers simply 


have no good reason to bid aggressively. Bidding near the reserve price is likely to get them 


what they want and still leave room for any dark-horse participants that show up. Meanwhile, 


even at $1.25/MHz-pop – drastically lower than the AWS-3 paired-spectrum price of $2.71 – the 


forward auction will take in some $30+ billion. DISH, having gone all-in on the last auction, now 


holds just $0.9 billion in cash and marketable investments, likely too little to significantly disrupt 


the bidding. With high supply flowing from the reverse auction and low demand entering the 


forward auction, and with DISH weakened, the final clearing price should approach the reserve 


price. Here we assume it winds up at $1.50/MHz-pop – essentially in line with the recently 


emerging consensus view.22 





What does this mean for DISH? With a more rational, less distorted benchmark price in focus, 


DISH will have a much harder time arguing for aggregate spectrum valuations in the many tens 


of billions. While management will no doubt argue that its largely mid-band portfolio is better 


suited to providing capacity than the 600MHz band and that it is therefore worth proportionally 


more, the fact remains that the self-interference that hurts low-frequency capacity can be 


                                                
21 In the top 40 “partial economic areas.” Furthermore, the $1.25 figure is binding only for spectrum 


clearing levels at or below 70 MHz; above that level, the auction price is allowed to be lower as long as 


the aggregate proceeds exceed what a $1.25 reserve price would have guaranteed if only 70 MHz had 


been cleared. For example, the reserve price could effectively step down to $0.875 in a 100MHz auction. 
22 $1.50/MHz-pops x 70 MHz x 320mm pops = $33.6 billion.

reduced by simply operating at lower power. Whatever 600MHz is worth, DISH’s AWS-3 


spectrum must be worth less. 





How much less? At their original FCC auctions, “clean” 700MHz licenses sold for 6.7x the price 


per MHz-pop of comparable AWS-1 licenses.23 On this basis, if 600MHz spectrum now sells for 


$1.50, then DISH’s AWS-3 spectrum is only worth $0.22. But we adopt a less extreme view.24 


The declining value of incremental coverage has in fact caused the difference in value between 


low- and high-band spectrum to compress. Triangulating across a number of relatively recent 


spectrum trades, however, we estimate that the ratio is still 2-3x: 





 When T-Mobile purchased 700MHz A Block spectrum from Verizon in January 2014 in 


exchange for cash and a mixture of AWS and PCS mid-band spectrum, it valued the 


700MHz at $1.85/MHz-pop. However, the licenses purchased were disproportionately in 


high-value markets; we estimate that $1.85 in those markets translates to a $1.45 


nationwide average. However, the A Block suffers from interference challenges. 


Assuming the same ratio of A to B Block values that prevailed in the 700MHz auction, a 


$1.45 price for the A Block implies $3.35 for the unimpaired B Block. Meanwhile, T-


Mobile valued the mid-band spectrum it gave to Verizon at $1.72/MHz-pop, but, again, 


this spectrum came disproportionately from high-value markets, implying a ~$1.55 


nationwide price. $3.35 for 700MHz B / $1.55 for mid-band = 2.2x. 


 When AT&T purchased 700MHz B Block spectrum from AT&T in September 2013 in 


exchange for cash and AWS-1 spectrum, the implied nationwide B Block price, by our 


estimates, was $2.78/MHz-pop. Moelis has estimated that the nationwide AWS-1 price 


was $0.81.25 The ratio of low- to mid-band was 3.4x. 


 In two separate transactions in 2013, Grain Management purchased 700MHz B Block 


spectrum for an implied national price of $3.20, while T-Mobile purchased AWS-1 


spectrum for an implied national price of $1.57. The ratio of low- to mid-band was 2.0x. 





Thus a $1.50/MHz-pop nationwide average price for 600MHz spectrum points to, at best, a 


$0.75/MHz-pop nationwide average price for standard mid-band spectrum like AWS-3. At 


auction, however, driven by DISH’s aggressive bidding, this spectrum sold for $2.71/MHz-pop, 


implying a drastic 72% markdown from 2015 to 2016.  


                                                
23 See Exhibit 1 from former FCC Chairman Kevin Martin’s 4/25/08 statement to Congress regarding the 


700MHz auction. We regard the 700MHz B Block as the only “clean” one. (The A Block suffers from 


interference from TV Channel 51, the C Block is subject to “open access” requirements initially viewed as 


burdensome, and the E Block is unpaired.) Since the B Block is licensed by Cellular Market Area (CMA), 


we compare it to the AWS-1 A Block, the only AWS-1 block licensed the same way. $2.67/MHz-pop for 


the 700MHz B Block / $0.40/MHz-pop for the AWS-1 A Bock = 6.7x. 
24 It’s interesting to note that the 6.7x price ratio is very close to what a simple theoretical model would 


predict. Based on propagation, we might expect spectrum value to go as the inverse square of the 


frequency (a point discussed in our Globalstar report). Using a 700 B center frequency of 722 MHz and 


an AWS-1 A center frequency of 1915 MHz, the ratio is 2.65, the square of which is 7.0 – close to the 


6.7x empirical value from the auctions. 
25 See Moelis’s 2/3/15 expert report in the LightSquared bankruptcy (Appendix A, slide 17, note 7).

Is this assumption too draconian? Note that the 72% figure is highly consistent with the 


comments from Verizon’s CFO quoted above. He asserted that AWS-3 licenses that sold for $6 


billion really had intrinsic value of only $1.5 billion since that level of capex could generate the 


same amount of incremental capacity as additional spectrum could. Dropping from a $6 billion 


purchase price to $1.5 billion of intrinsic value is a 75% decline.  





Moreover, $0.75/MHz-pop is in line with the expectations that T-Mobile laid out (slide 7) to the 


FCC prior to the AWS-3 auction in January 2014. It estimated that the H Block auction would 


clear at $0.50-$0.75/MHz-pop, while the AWS-3 auction would clear at $0.80-$1.20. However, 


DISH was the only serious bidder in the H Block auction – none of the carriers participated – 


and it won every license available at an average of exactly $0.50/MHz-pop, the minimum price it 


had promised the FCC it would bid. Therefore, in the absence of such a promise, the price 


would have been below $0.50 and thus worse than T-Mobile expected. The natural inference 


would be that the AWS-3 auction price would likewise fall below T-Mobile’s $0.80/MHz-pop 


lower bound – consistent with our $0.75/MHz-pop estimate. (Because DISH’s AWS-3 licenses 


are disproportionately drawn from high-value markets, we adjust the nationwide $0.75 up to 


$0.83 for DISH, based on the assumption that all AWS-3 licenses drop in price by the same 


percentage.) 





Whatever its market value, the AWS-3 band is at least standard spectrum.26 Verizon, AT&T, and 


T-Mobile are all incorporating it into their networks, guaranteeing that an ecosystem of handsets 


and equipment will support it. Because of these economies of scale, standard spectrum used by 


multiple carriers is always far more valuable than peculiar one-off bands. Unfortunately for 


DISH, the bulk of its spectrum portfolio consists of the latter: 





 Upper AWS-4 (2180-2200 MHz): While officially included in the industry standards body 


3GPP’s Band 66 – the extended AWS band – DISH’s 20 MHz of nationwide upper AWS-


4 spectrum has a unique limitation: only Band 66 devices capable of carrier aggregation 


are required to support it.27 Carrier aggregation – an LTE-Advanced feature that allows 


two separate units of spectrum to work in concert – is common in high-end phones but 


far less common in cheaper ones (which, in the aggregate, account for a high volume of 


unit sales). Indeed, the entire motivation behind giving DISH’s upper AWS-4 spectrum 


                                                
26 Note, however, that DISH’s AWS-3 spectrum, held by the designated entities SNR and Northstar, is 


now encumbered: any future buyer of the underlying licenses must assume a pro-rata share of DISH’s 


deficiency payment, discussed below. (See e.g. the “special conditions” listed for one of Northstar’s 


licenses in Virginia.) Since the amount of the deficiency payment won’t be determined until the unknown 


future date when the FCC re-auctions the licenses that DISH’s entities defaulted on, these encumbrances 


will likely impede monetization. 
27 See 3GPP TSG-RAN Working Group 4 document R4-155921, “Text Proposal for TR 36.869: Section 


7.2 Interoperability by Means of CA”: “there may be some concerns that mandating intra-band CA 


precludes low cost (i.e. non-CA) UEs and MTC devices from being supported in the band. Therefore, a 


compromise solution to address both interoperability and low cost UE concerns in the band is proposed, 


which is to mandate intra-band CA to CA-capable UEs only.”

second-class status within Band 66 was to enable “low cost” user devices to support 


Band 66 without supporting DISH’s spectrum.  





Today, according to Sprint, only 21% of postpaid phones support carrier aggregation.28 


While this figure will likely grow over time – Sprint also disclosed that 76% of new 


phones sold support it – it’s unlikely to become 100% any time soon, especially given 


the trend toward lower phone turnover. Furthermore, certain carrier-aggregation–


capable devices29 only support a maximum combined downlink bandwidth of 20 MHz. 


Such a device, if already enjoying 10 or 20 MHz of downlink bandwidth on its primary 


band, would only be able to use 0 to 10 MHz of DISH’s upper AWS-4 – not the full 20 


MHz. 





Furthermore, while Band 66 is a superset of the widely used AWS-1 band (Band 4), 


carriers are unlikely to deploy Band 66 equipment unless they have AWS-3 spectrum in 


a given market. But Verizon, for instance, owns no AWS-3 spectrum in New York or 


Chicago; T-Mobile owns no AWS-3 spectrum in any of the top nine metro areas. If 


Verizon later acquires or leases DISH’s upper AWS-4 spectrum in these areas, it would 


likely need to rip out its Band 4 equipment and replace it with Band 66 – a far more 


grueling and costly undertaking than DISH bulls seem to appreciate. Meanwhile, Sprint 


doesn’t use AWS spectrum, making it incapable of benefiting from DISH’s upper AWS-4 


at all,30 further shrinking the pool of interested parties. 





In short, though DISH glosses over these inconvenient details, the carrier-aggregation–


related limits on DISH’s upper AWS-4 spectrum make it materially less valuable than the 


core AWS-3 portion of Band 66, with permanently lower device support and reduced 


usability even for a subset of devices that will support it. As a result, we believe it is 


generous to value upper AWS-4 at a 15% haircut to our assumed nationwide paired 


AWS-3 price of $0.75/MHz-pop. 





 AWS-3 unpaired uplink/lower AWS-4/upper H Block (1695-1710 MHz / 1995-2020 


MHz): Based on DISH’s recent press release about the 3GPP standardization process, 


we believe that this proposed Franken-band represents its current strategy for cobbling 


together some value out of wholly non-standard spectrum that, in its original form, no 


one else wanted. The AWS-3 unpaired uplink spectrum that DISH purchased did not 


attract any serious carrier bids, nor did the earlier H Block auction. But if carriers were 


unwilling to pay $0.50/MHz-pop for the H Block before, there’s no reason why’d they pay 


DISH anything more for this “mega H Block” now.

30 At least under current LTE standards. It’s possible that future standards may allow the aggregation of 


the upper AWS-4 portion of Band 66 with e.g. Sprint’s 850MHz spectrum, but no such carrier-aggregation 


cases are currently defined, let alone supported by devices.

In addition, with its unusual, asymmetric 15+25 MHz structure, it raises carrier-


aggregation issues similar to those that affect the upper AWS-4 band: under current 


draft rules,31 the first iteration of the band would only allow, at most, 15+15 MHz of 


bandwidth, wasting a minimum of 10 MHz (40%) of the available downlink – more in 


certain locations where other licensees own a portion of the uplink band or where the 


need to coordinate with incumbent government users of the spectrum in 27 protection 


zones32 restricts operations. Future standards will likely allow intra-band carrier 


aggregation, enabling some hypothetical devices to access the full downlink band, but, 


again, only if they are high-end enough to support carrier aggregation in the first place. 





Setting technical complications aside, the most important problem is that the band 


simply has no advocate on the planet besides DISH. While Verizon and AT&T could 


likely create an ecosystem around this band if they chose to, they’re well aware of their 


own power and wouldn’t leak that value to DISH by overpaying for orphan spectrum. 


Thus we value this band at a 20% discount to the H Block auction price: $0.40/MHz-pop. 





 Lower H Block (1915-1920 MHz): Left out of DISH’s Franken-band is what was 


originally the uplink portion of the H Block, which sits adjacent to the PCS uplink band. 


We highly doubt that a narrow, isolated, non-standard, unpaired uplink band will garner 


any market interest and thus ascribe no value to it. 





 700MHz E Block (722-728 MHz): Though it does belong to a proper 3GPP band (Band 


29), this small piece of downlink-only spectrum is little used in the real world even 


though AT&T owns a large piece of it (as well as the entire adjacent band). Because of 


technical problems with using carrier aggregation to combine two different low-frequency 


bands, the 700MHz E Block can only be aggregated with a higher-frequency band like 


AWS or PCS that suffers from inferior propagation – thereby forfeiting the key advantage 


of 700MHz. As a result, the E Block, despite being low-band spectrum, should be valued 


like mid-band. We estimate that AT&T purchased 700MHz D and E Block spectrum from 


Qualcomm in 2010 at a 6% premium to the pricing that prevailed in the 2008 700MHz 


auction; applying the same premium to DISH’s original purchase price would generate a 


price per MHz-pop of $0.52. However, AT&T likely regrets its former purchase, given its 


subsequent inability to exploit the spectrum on a meaningful scale. Thus, we apply a 


discount and value this band at $0.40/MHz-pop. 





This band-by-band analysis is summarized below. In the aggregate, we value DISH’s cellular 


spectrum at $11.5 billion gross.

Breakdown of DISH’s Spectrum Portfolio by Band 
and Kerrisdale-Estimated Value 





Source: company filings, Kerrisdale analysis 





However, there is one more effect to take into account. After the FCC denied DISH the “small 


business” discounts that it thought it had obtained by bidding through its designated entities, 


DISH chose to selectively default, paying for only a subset of the licenses it had won. In addition 


to assessing a penalty for this behavior, the FCC put DISH on the hook for any shortfall relative 


to its original purchase price when the agency ultimately re-auctions the forfeited licenses. 


Overall, DISH’s bids for these licenses totaled $3.4 billion; assuming that their value declines 


72% from the inflated auction price, DISH will therefore be liable for an additional $2.5 billion – a 


pure loss.33 Netting this cost against the $11.5 billion in gross spectrum value, we find that the 


overall fair value of DISH’s portfolio is ~$9 billion, or roughly half of what the market implies. 


And this estimate doesn’t even consider DISH’s costly and challenging buildout deadlines, 


further discussed below. 





It’s been easy for investors to buy into the DISH narrative because its underpinnings – more 


smartphones, more data traffic, ever rising spectrum prices – seemed so unassailable. As the 


spectrum market reverses direction, however, the narrative has stopped lining up with reality. 


DISH “put every damn egg” it had into one basket; now the basket is starting to slip. 





                                                
33 Using our estimates, DISH will be entitled to a partial refund of the $516 million interim payment made 


to the FCC in 2015, partially offsetting the larger deficiency payment. However, in five years DISH will 


also need to pay a contractually defined “put price” to the controlling minority investors in the designated 


entities, SNR and Northstar, that legally hold its AWS-3 licenses; we estimate this price to be $562 


million, based on a 20% annually compounded return on the $226 million of capital contributed by those 


minority investors. At a 10% discount rate, the present value of this put liability is $349 million, roughly 


equal to the $373 million FCC refund that, on our numbers, DISH will eventually receive.

V. Time Is Not on DISH’s Side 





Some observers contend that there’s no need for DISH to rush into a deal now. If Verizon wants 


to talk tough, let it; as traffic grows and its network struggles under the burden, it will eventually 


come crawling back to the negotiating table. As explained above, we dissent from this view – 


but even if we didn’t, time is not on DISH’s side, and the clock is ticking. 





As part of its standard operating procedure, the FCC requires licensees to provide specified 


minimum levels of coverage in their markets by specific dates; the purpose is to prevent 


wasteful spectrum warehousing. While the agency has, in many circumstances, granted 


extensions and waivers – including to DISH – licensees aren’t entitled to leniency, and some 


fairly large spectrum holders (like FiberTower34) have indeed been stripped of their holdings for 


failing to comply with buildout requirements. Because DISH has acquired its spectrum in several 


different transactions, it faces a range of deadlines, summarized below: 





 AWS-4 


o 40% coverage (by population) by March 2017 


o 70% coverage by March 2021 


o If the first deadline is missed, then the second one moves up to March 2020. 


 700MHz E Block 


o Same timeline as AWS-4. 


 H Block 


o 40% coverage by April 2018 


o 75% coverage by April 2024 


o If the first deadline is missed, then the second moves up to April 2022.  


 AWS-3 


o 40% coverage by October 2021 


o 75% coverage by October 2027 


o If the first deadline is missed, then the second one moves up to October 2025. 





With no sign of any buildout underway, DISH’s March 2017 and April 2018 deadlines for 


providing coverage and offering service to 40% of the US population are already as good as 


missed. There just isn’t enough time to go from a standing start to covering some 125 million 


people – especially without any existing infrastructure. That moves the focus to March 2020, 


when DISH must achieve 70% coverage via AWS-4 and the 700MHz E Block, and April 2022, 


when it must achieve 75% coverage via the H Block. March 2020 is less than four years away. 


All the carriers are currently knee-deep in network engineering to make use of their existing 


spectrum – Verizon, for instance, has publicly sketched out its spectrum roadmap through 


“2019+.” Since no carrier has any particular need for DISH’s non-standard spectrum, there’s no 


compelling reason to alter current plans to accommodate strange new bands. That puts DISH in 


                                                
34 See e.g. Fletcher, Heald & Hildreth’s summary of the FiberTower situation in FHH Telecom Law, Dec. 


2012 (p. 3).

a weak bargaining position, because it needs to find a deal in the next few years, while the 


carriers can comfortably wait. The nearer the deadline looms, the more the carriers can 


squeeze DISH. 





Indeed, meeting the March 2020 deadline in a manner consistent with the spirit of the build-out 


requirements35 is likely already impossible. In May 2012, DISH’s vice president for wireless 


development said, in a sworn statement,36 that, “[b]ased on an ambitious buildout schedule, 


DISH believes it can deploy its network to 60 million people (‘POPs’) within four years.” But 60 


million people is less than 20% of the country’s population; in the next four years, DISH (or any 


entity it sells its licenses to) has to cover 3.5x that many people. While DISH once argued that 


“[e]ven at four years, a 30 percent POPs coverage requirement is aggressive and likely 


unrealistic,”37 it now faces a vastly more stringent requirement over an even shorter timeframe. 


Leasing or selling the spectrum doesn’t fix the problem – the same 2020 deadline will apply to 


whoever holds the licenses. 





DISH can’t demand an extension from the FCC simply on the grounds that it wants to wait 


longer to hold out for a bigger check from Verizon or AT&T; it likely needs to claim 


(disingenuously, in our view) that circumstances beyond its control prevented a big enough 


build-out.38 If it literally makes no attempt to build anything from now until 2020, it will almost 


certainly lose its licenses. Thus DISH’s best choice is, as quickly as possible, to create what 


some call a “save build” – a wasteful, low-performing network that exists not to serve customers 


but to just barely satisfy regulatory requirements and keep licenses in good standing. But DISH 


needs to cover 70% of the population in each of 176 “Economic Areas” – a tall order. For 


smaller carriers, achieving near-nationwide coverage has cost ~$30 billion.39 Based on our 


discussions with industry experts and participants, we believe that, by cutting almost every 


corner, DISH might be able to achieve 70% coverage in four years with only 20,000 cell sites 


(prioritizing the tallest towers to reach the furthest at the lowest cost) and an average equipment 


cost per cell site of ~$160,000, for a total investment of $3.2 billion – a tenth of the cost of an 


actually functional network that any consumer would want to use. 





Without some Potemkin village of a network, DISH is at extreme risk of seeing its most valuable 


assets evaporate overnight. Even with such a ruse, however, the FCC might still have a hard 


time concluding that DISH was truly providing “reliable coverage” or meaningful “service”; much 


                                                
35 In the AWS-4 Report & Order, the FCC said, “As an initial matter, we observe that the incumbent 2 GHz 


MSS licensees [owned and controlled by DISH] generally support our seven year end-of-term build-out 


benchmark and have committed to ‘aggressively build-out a broadband network’ if they receive 


terrestrial authority to operate in the AWS-4 band. We expect this commitment to be met…” (emphasis 


added).

38 The incorporation of the upper AWS-4 band into Band 66 (and earlier into Band 23) actually hurts 


DISH’s ability to get an extension since it will be less able to argue that equipment was unavailable.

depends on the Commission’s general attitude toward the firm. If DISH does lose its AWS-4 


licenses in 2020, then much of the rest of its spectrum portfolio will fall apart as well. Without the 


lower AWS-4 band, DISH’s would-be Franken-band would revert to 15 MHz of unpaired uplink, 


which no carriers want, and the 5+5 MHz H Block, which might at best add a small amount of 


value to Sprint’s PCS G Block – but Sprint, of course, is already long on spectrum and short on 


cash. With these holdings losing all realistic hopes of generating value, DISH would be left with 


its paired AWS-3 and 700MHz E Block spectrum, for a gross value of $2.7 billion, largely wiped 


out by $2.5 billion in AWS-3 re-auction penalties. In this scenario, DISH’s equity would lose 


almost all of its value and decline to ~$8 per share.  





In fact, the outcome could be even worse. While we assume in our base case that DISH does 


manage to monetize almost all of its spectrum (with the minor exception of the stranded lower H 


Block), there’s a serious risk that DISH eventually loses many of its licenses in the face of 


overwhelming indifference from the carriers. After all, if DISH loses its licenses, the spectrum 


doesn’t go away; the FCC would likely re-auction it, complete with new, extended buildout 


deadlines. To the extent a carrier actually was interested in DISH’s spectrum at some point in 


the future, it’s not at all obvious that buying it from DISH is a better option than simply waiting for 


the FCC to take it back and then buying it at auction.  





While some DISH bulls continue to dismiss the FCC’s deadlines as toothless, DISH’s envelope-


pushing tactics have earned it no friends in Washington; whatever goodwill it once enjoyed as a 


potential disruptor of the perceived carrier oligopoly has now evaporated. The FCC has no 


reason to give DISH special treatment. And this suits the oligopoly just fine. With no impending 


spectrum crisis to further jack up prices, and with even more spectrum coming to market in the 


600MHz auction and beyond, the carriers have the upper hand against DISH, and they know it. 





VI. DISH’s Core TV Business Is Weak 





Borrowing from the sell-side consensus and valuing DISH’s pay-TV business at ~5x annual 


EBITDA of ~$3 billion, we find that almost all the value of that business flows to debt holders; as 


a result, the vast majority of DISH’s equity value (84%) stems from spectrum. A keen focus on 


spectrum is thus appropriate. However, it’s worth remembering all the difficulties that DISH’s 


satellite operations face. 





The challenges posed by the rise of “cord cutters” and “cord nevers” are widely discussed with 


respect to cable operators, but cable can at least supply internet connectivity to retain 


customers (at a higher profit margin). DISH can’t. This problem has existed for years, but, as 


low-cost alternatives to conventional pay TV like Netflix and Hulu continue to improve and grow, 


DISH is particularly at risk because, based on our discussions with industry participants, its 


customer base is skewed heavily toward low-income and price-sensitive households. DirecTV 


has long boasted higher ARPU, for instance (driven in part by its expensive but exclusive and 


very sticky NFL Sunday Ticket product), and DISH has tended to offer steeper promotional 


discounts. Today, DISH is increasingly squeezed between, on the one hand, cable operators

offering internet access and video for not much more than DISH charges for TV only and, on the 


other hand, over-the-top services providing content in a different format but at a much lower 


price. As the pay TV industry moves more toward “skinny bundles” offering fewer channels for a 


lower monthly rate, DISH’s value-conscious customers are especially likely to be tempted away 


by the competition. Meanwhile, content providers have continued to hike their prices, driving 


relentless margin contraction for DISH (partially mitigated by the company’s unusually sharp-


elbowed negotiations).   





While consensus expects fairly stable earnings for as far as the eye can see, which we 


incorporate into our base case, we also consider an adverse scenario that simply extrapolates 


the two key trends just described: customer attrition and content-cost inflation.  Adjusting for 


subscribers to DISH’s new over-the-top service, to which we will return, DISH’s pay-TV 


subscribers fell 4% year-over-year in 2016 Q1.40 If this trend persist or deepens, DISH could 


easily lose another 5 to 10% of its subscribers over time. In addition, subscriber-related 


expenses have steadily increased for a long time, driven by content costs; in the past four 


years, those expenses have risen an average of 160 basis points per year as a percentage of 


revenue. Continuing on that trajectory for another year would take subscriber-related expenses 


to ~60% of revenue. Further, we assume that other expenses remain flat; DISH is already 


known for strict budgets and penny-pinching, suggesting that there’s little fat to cut. Taken 


together, these assumptions imply a 16 to 26% decrease in EBITDA. Using the same 5x 


multiple, this scenario would imply a pay-TV enterprise value of just ~$11 to $12.5 billion – 


within striking distance of DISH’s net debt. It doesn’t take much disruption to push the satellite 


subsidiary, on a standalone basis, into likely insolvency.

Can DISH’s over-the-top live streaming TV service, Sling, turn around the business? We doubt 


it. Less than a year after it debuted, industry observers are already writing it off. One recently

reported that Sling “has seen decelerating signups since they launched in the market. There 


was a rush of sign ups when the service came out, but now, the growth has not been that 


impressive,” due in part to issues with video quality and user frustrations with the inability of 


multiple members of a household to stream different content simultaneously. Another pundit 


even provocatively predicted that Sling TV would be dead by the end of 2016: 





The streaming service…is buggy. Since its introduction last January, it has suffered 


major technical failures during several highly-watched shows, such as college 


basketball’s Final Four, episodes of Game of Thrones and The Walking Dead, and even 


the mid-season finale of Pretty Little Liars. Numerous Sling TV users report the picture 


either freezes or goes black during such high-profile programs, or they have difficulty 


logging in. 





It’s become undeniably clear that Sling TV is not equipped to guarantee a reliable 


stream when a large number of people tune in. 





The technical snafus have created negative word-of-mouth for the service, which has 


kept subscriber totals under 500,000 according to several analysts. 





…So I can't see Sling TV's service improving much over the next year, which will 


significantly hurt its subscription efforts. Consequently, at some point, I predict that Dish 


will pull the plug because it will be more trouble than it's worth. 





While we expect DISH to give Sling more time to prove itself, the product’s mediocrity is a 


reminder that competing against the likes of Netflix is easier said than done. Moreover, even if 


the product did take off, it would likely be a Pyrrhic victory: given the relatively low price of Sling 


but the high cost of some of its content, particularly ESPN,  Sling is doomed to low margins, and, 


given its potential appeal to DISH’s price-sensitive satellite subscribers, it runs the risk of 


cannibalizing the more lucrative core product. Even if Sling sticks around, there’s no easy way 


for DISH to overcome the weakness of the pay TV sector and its own particularly weak position 


within it.

VII. Conclusion 


DISH Network: 
Consensus Valuation vs. Kerrisdale View  





Source: company filings, sell-side reports, Kerrisdale analysis 


*Long-term debt and capital lease obligations net of cash and marketable investment 


securities. 


†Incorporates (1) cost of AWS-3 auction penalty based on difference between DISH's 


original bids and our estimate of the fair value of the spectrum in question, (2) 


estimated minimum cost of meeting the AWS-4 performance requirements by March 


7, 2020, and (3) present value of designated-entity put price 





Combining the consensus view of the value of DISH’s TV business with our band-by-band 


analysis of the value of its spectrum portfolio, we arrive at an equity fair value of $20 per share, 


58% below the current stock price. In a less probable but still quite plausible adverse scenario, 


in which DISH loses its AWS-4 spectrum as a result of missed buildout deadlines, fair value 


drops down to just $8 per share. From there, even modest additional impairment to the satellite-


TV business would threaten to wipe out the equity entirely. 





Such price targets may seem hard to swallow; DISH’s swagger alone has convinced many that, 


no matter how much it seems like there’s no real plan, everything will somehow work out 


anyway. But, considered dispassionately, DISH’s current strategic direction was always a 


dangerous longshot: levering up a slowly decaying business to double and triple down on an 


illiquid, highly specialized, highly regulated, limited-life, non-cash-flowing asset with only two to 


three plausible buyers. DISH has outlived many skeptics over the years, but, in investing as in 


gambling, there’s such a thing as pressing your luck.
