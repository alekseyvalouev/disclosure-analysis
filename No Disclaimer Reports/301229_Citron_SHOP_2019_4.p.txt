What a Difference a 
Month Makes 


Shopify to $100 in the next 12 months
A	year	ago,	when	Nvidia	was	trading	at	$230	and	
there	was	no	stopping	this	leader	in	AI	and	
datacenter,	Citron	foresaw	the	compe>>on	and	
eventual	headwinds	to	its	core	business.		While	
investors	cheered	the	stock	all	the	way	to	$290,	
we	stuck	by	our	guns	and	just	when	the	stock	
looked	unstoppable	it	collapsed	to	under	$130	
in	just	two	months.					


If	Shopify	is	trading	over	$200	in	12	months,	
Citron	will	donate	$200k	to	the	Robin	Hood	
Founda>on.

SHOP is 2019’s NVDA – It’s Unstoppable Until It’s Not 
Follow Up to Citron’s 1 Year Challenge on NVDA
03 


Citron	famously	commented	on	Shopify	18	months	ago	as	we	were	cri>cal	on	its	dependence	on	“entrepreneurs”	
otherwise	known	as	dropshippers.		While	we	maintain	our	cri>cism	of	that	part	of	the	business,	we	give	full	credit	to	
Tobi	and	the	Shopify	team	for	crea>ng	best	in	class	ecommerce	soOware	for	SMB	merchants.	


The	move	of	50%	in	Shopify’	stock	price	this	year	despite	its	below	consensus	profit	guidance	can	be	aVributed	to	the	
rise	in	social	commerce.		However,	remember	that	this	guidance	was	given	BEFORE	the	news	flow	over	the	past	30	
days.		Just	when	the	business	seemed	unstoppable,	the	obvious	change	in	narra>ve	for	this	market	darling	will	soon	
cause	it	to	fall	vic>m	to	the	forces	of	gravity	from	its	stratospheric	valua>on	--	which	was	based	on	no	compe11on,	no	
regulatory	risk,	and	flawless	execu1on.	


While	Shopify	has	been	expensive	for	a	while,	the	short	now	is	not	a	valua1on	call	but	rather	a	dras1c	change	in	the	
compe11ve	and	regulatory	landscape.		These	risks	will	almost	certainly	nega1vely	impact	the	growth	of	a	stock	
priced	at	a	forward	mul1ple	of	over	300x.	


The Good, Bad, and the Ugly
What Has Changed? 


04 


In	the	past	month,	A	LOT	has	changed	for	Shopify:			


• The	stock	traded	to	an	all->me	peak	valua>on	


• Facebook	launched	Instagram	checkout	


• Square	announced	it	is	revamping	its	online	store	


• Mailchimp	terminated	its	partnership	with	Shopify	


• Mark	Zuckerberg	pounded	the	table	on	cleaning	up	the	Facebook	pla`orm	


• News	surfaced	that	MicrosoO	was	launching	a	compe>>ve	offering	to	Shopify	


The	combined	result	is	a	perfect	storm	for	Shopify	that	will	knock	the	stock	off	its	high	wire	to	$100	in	the	next	12	
months.
05 


At	the	end	of	2018,	while	investors	were	focused	on	the	Instagram	execu>ve	departures	and	Facebook	privacy	
issues,	the	real	story	became	the	eleva>on	of	Vishal	Shah,	a	long->me	Facebook	employee	who	was	chosen	to	run	
Instagram,	and	his	dedica>on	to	making	Instagram	a	na>ve	shopping	des>na>on.		Citron	noted	this	in	December	in	
our	Facebook	research	where	we	named	it	the	S&P’s	2019	stock	of	the	year	and	recommended	readers	buy	it	at	
$126.	


It	cannot	be	denied	that	the	success	of	Shopify	is	directly	>ed	to	Facebook	and	Instagram	ads.		We	give	Shopify	
credit	for	being	early	adopters	in	integra>ng	its	ecommerce	pla`orm	with	Instagram	and	benefi>ng	from	social	
influencer	marke>ng.	


While	this	does	not	immediately	s>fle	Shopify’s	business,	the	risk	to	this	beyond	high	mul>ple	stock	cannot	be	
ignored.		The	risks	were	even	acknowledged	by	Shopify’s	biggest	bull	--	RBC	analyst	Ross	MacMillan	--	who	warns	
that	Instagram's	new	system	"circumvents"	Shopify's	and	will	impair	its	ability	to	profit	from	Instagram's	future	
growth.	


The	same	concerns	were	echoed	by	Evercore’s	Anthony	DiClemente	as	he	wrote	that	this	launch	“effec>vely	
eliminates	the	dis>nc>on	between	Instagram	as	a	social	media	pla`orm	and	an	e-commerce	marketplace”	and	that	
“Instagram	has	proven	a	powerful	product	discovery	plaDorm	and	its	entry	into	e-commerce	can’t	be	ignored”.	


Instagram Checkout
06 


Think	about	this.		There	are	25	million	
businesses	on	the	Instagram	pla`orm	
that	do	not	even	have	a	website.		
Facebook	believes	that	these	
merchants	can	use	Instagram’s	500	
million	daily	users	as	its	pla`orm.		The	
launch	of	this	new	checkout	feature	
eliminates	the	need	for	an	external	
website	(i.e.,	one	that	is	hosted	by	
Shopify)	for	these	businesses.		


To	show	the	muscle	and	influence	of	
Facebook,	it	should	be	noted	that	the	
checkout	launch	ini>al	adapters	are	
Kylie	Cosme>cs,	the	face	of	Shopify’s	
success,	and	Nike,	the	ul>mate	
enterprise	customer,	among	others.	


Instagram Checkout
07 


Last	year,	Weebly	was	acquired	by	Square.		At	the	>me	Weebly	seemed	like	a	sub	par	offering	
rela>ve	to	Shopify.		Just	two	weeks	ago,	Square	launched	a	product	offering	to	its	over	2	million	
merchant	installed	base	consis>ng	of	a	full	suite	of	ecommerce	solu>ons	that	is	compe>>ve	to	
Shopify.	


hVps://squareup.com/about/investors/press/a59ba0b5-ac91-4482-8f1a-428f475a5f28	


Even	if	you	assume	that	Square	does	not	capture	any	of	the	current	Shopify	merchants	it	cannot	
be	denied	that	this	will	put	a	damper	on	Shopify’s	future	growth	in	the	SMB	market.	


This	was	noted	by	ad	execu>ve	Steve	Weiss:		“It's	preVy	clear	Square	is	making	a	strong,	well-
>med	play	for	Shopify's	market	share	while	con>nuing	to	aVract	larger	merchants.“	


hVps://www.retaildive.com/news/square-challenges-shopify-with-e-commerce-tools-for-sma
ll- businesses/551304/	


While	Shopify’s	growth	includes	encouraging	future	“entrepreneurs”	to	quit	their	current	jobs,	 
Square	will	be	migra>ng	higher	quality	merchants	from	its	exis>ng	installed	base.	








It’s Hip to be Square

While	Shopify	now	has	to	compete	with	the	gorillas	in	social	marke>ng	and	SMB	payments,	the	vulnerabili>es	of	its	ecosystem	were	just	exposed	by	the	
chimp.	


As	the	world	is	moving	towards	greater	enforcement	of	data	privacy,	Shopify’s	new	terms	of	service	appear	to	be	moving	in	the	opposite	direc>on,	as	
highlighted	by	its	recent	divorce	from	noted	enterprise	partner	MailChimp.	


Whatever	version	of	the	truth	you	believe,	it’s	clear	that	MailChimp	could	not	agree	with	Shopify’s	new	privacy	terms	and	believed	poten>al	li>ga>on	and	
headline	risk	outweighed	the	benefits	of	the	Shopify	partnership.		In	a	sign	of	the	impending	compe>>on,	MailChimp	did	partner	with	Square	as	it	
obviously	felt	comfortable	with	Square’s	terms	of	service	and	that	any	lost	Shopify	volume	will	eventually	be	replaced	with	Square	volume.		


The	poten>al	risk	to	media	coverage	of	Shopify’s	privacy	terms	could	severely	damage	the	mul>ple	of	Shopify	at	any	>me…	just	look	at	what	happened	to	
Facebook.		Citron	believes	the	real	story	is	not	the	risk	of	Kylie	Jenner	geqng	your	home	address.		Rather,	your	customer	informa>on	is	being	shared	with	
dropshippers	and	app	developers,	many	of	whom	have	no	real	business	and	could	poten>ally	use	a	Shopify	site	as	a	ruse	to	collect	customer	data.		


Does	anyone	remember	the	famous	personality	test	that	was	a	Trojan	horse	for	the	collec>on	of	customer	data?	


Most	importantly,	the	MailChimp	divorce	could	put	the	“Scarlet	P”	on	Shopify	which	could	impair	all	future	enterprise	business	and	you	can	be	sure	that	
compe>>on	will	make	poten>al	customers	aware.	


From Gorillas to Chimps
09 


Shopify’s	growth	has	been	fueled	by	a	closed	ecosystem	that	easily	integrates	with	
Instagram.		Shopify	s>ll	does	not	disclose	the	%	of	its	800K	merchants	that	are	
dropshippers	since	it	would	give	visibility	into	its	churn.		By	looking	at	the	photos	
of	YouTube	from	just	this	month,	it’s	obvious	that	the	Shopify	“entrepreneur”	
program	is	alive	and	well.			


	Shopify	has	become	the	target	of	numerous	lawsuits	for	trademark	and	copyright 
infringement	due	to	scammers	running	fake	Shopify	stores.

If	Zuckerberg	is	serious	about	cleaning	up	the	internet	and	Instagram	is	serious	 
about	becoming	a	shopping	des>na>on,	then	Shopify	shareholders	should	be	 
concerned	that	the	$70	hoodie	is	a	thing	of	the	past.		Facebook’s	inevitable	 
policing	of	the	Instagram	pla`orm	will	result	in	a	significant	increase	in	churn	for	 
Shopify’s	“entrepreneurs”.

The	underbelly	of	Shopify’s	business	is	not	lost	on	Weebly’s	CEO	who	has	stated:	


“It's	the	newest	scam,	right?		It	used	to	be	the	Nigerian	prince	that	was	 
emailing	you,	and	now	it's	the	burner	brand	on	Instagram.		It's	working,

Just	yesterday,	news	surfaced	that	MicrosoO	was	launching	a	Shopify	compe>tor.			


While	we	do	not	have	any	further	details,	we	can	only	assume	that	MicrosoO	will	be	
focused	on	the	enterprise	customer	and	headless	commerce.			


A	key	takeaway	by	Shopify	bull	RBC	from	the	2019	Shoptalk	conference	was	that	headless	
commerce	is	an	emerging	trend	within	ecommerce.		RBC	noted	that	“it	is	possible	Shopify	
will	want	to	strengthen	certain	na>ve	capabili>es”	as	Shopify	is	not	a	leader	within	this	
space	unlike	Adobe	and	Salesforce	(and	poten>ally	MicrosoO).	


Again,	we	are	not	saying	MicrosoO	will	take	away	any	current	Shopify	customers	
immediately	or	destroy	Shopify’s	business.		But,	the	possible	entrance	of	MicrosoO	into	a	
soOware	based	product	will	most	certainly	dampen	Shopify’s	growth	outlook.		


Hello Mr. Softy

It	first	must	be	noted	that	the	risks	stated	in	this	report	have	emerged	at	the	same	>me	we’ve	seen	decelera>on	in	its	
business	–	all	while	Shopify	is	trading	at	a	historical	peak	valua>on.	


Where is Shopify Stock in 12 Months?
13 


The	past	30	days	have	changed	the	long-term	narra>ve	on	
Shopify.		What	is	it	worth?	


Taking	the	EV/EBITDA	mul>ple	of	four	high	growth	best	in	
class	soOware	companies	with	unique	offerings	and	
assuming	that	Shopify	trades	at	double	that	valua>on	
because	of	slightly	higher	growth	puts	the	stock	at	$100.	


It’s	nice	to	see	Deutsche	Bank	finally	caught	on	to	what	
Citron	stated	in	December	that	Instagram	commerce	is	the	
future	growth	engine	of	Facebook.			


If	an	investor	was	using	a	Shopify	investment	as	a	proxy	to	
play	this	trend,	even	with	the	recent	rebound	in	Facebook,	
you	can	buy	Facebook	growing	24%	this	year	with	a	
massive	moat	at	an	NTM	EV/EBITDA	mul>ple	of	12x	vs.	
Shopify	growing	38%	this	year	with	major	compe>>ve	and	
regulatory	risks	trading	at	over	300x.		It’s	a	no	brainer.

Conclusion

Knowing	when	to	sell	is	just	as	important	as	knowing	when	to	buy	a	stock.	


While	we	applaud	Shopify’s	shareholders	and	management	for	acknowledging	the	opportunity	in	the	migra>on	of	
SMB’s	to	the	internet	and	crea>ng	an	ecosystem	that	has	been	considered	best	in	class,	you	must	also	acknowledge	the	
challenges	that	lie	ahead	of	the	company	that	have	emerged	in	the	past	30	days.	


LyO’s	recent	IPO	puts	Shopify’s	stratospheric	valua>on	into	perspec>ve.		Shopify	operates	in	an	increasingly	compe>>ve	
industry	that	RBC	es>mates	has	a	TAM	of	$15-$20	billion	while	LyO	operates	in	a	duopoly	where	Goldman	Sachs	
projects	the	industry	to	grow	to	$285	billion	by	2030.		Yet,	LyO	trades	at	an	NTM	EV/Sales	mul>ple	of	6x	while	Shopify’s	
core	subscrip>on	solu>ons	business	is	valued	at	over	22x	when	generously	assuming	that	its	merchant	solu>ons	
business	should	trade	in-line	with	PayPal.		


Citron	is	puqng	our	money	where	our	mouth	is.		If	Shopify	is	trading	over	$200	in	12	months,	Citron	will	donate	$200k	
to	the	Robin	Hood	Founda>on.	


As	we	correctly	predicted	with	respect	to	the	share	price	of	Nvidia,	Citron	believes	Shopify	will	trade	to	$100	in	the	next	
12	months.
