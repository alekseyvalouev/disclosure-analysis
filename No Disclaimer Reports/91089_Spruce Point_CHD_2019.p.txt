Executive Summary

Spruce Point Estimates 35% – 50% Downside Risk 
At Church & Dwight (NYSE: CHD)


Spruce Point has significant concerns about Church & Dwight (NYSE: CHD), an S&P 500 company, and roll-up acquiror of personal care and consumer products. 
Under its older leadership, management pursued a conservative strategy to leverage its core Arm & Hammer brand by diversifying and integrating acquisitions, 
while still prioritizing product innovation, and manufacturing excellence. With the elevation of Matt Farrell to CEO in 2016, Spruce Point believes CHD’s strategy 


has pivoted towards extreme financial engineering, aggressive accounting, and managerial self-enrichment practices. As fundamentals deteriorate in CHD’s retail 
environment, and it’s now clear that 60% of its legacy Power Brand acquisitions are failing, Spruce Point believes that CHD’s recent Waterpik and FLAWLESS 


levered acquisitions were made in desperation at outlandish valuations. If history is any guide, recent deals will disappointment investors. With CHD’s shares at a 
8% premium to average analyst price targets, and debt rising, investors seeking safety in CHD’s stock face 35%–50% downside ($40 - $52/share).

Fundamentals

Worrisome 


Strategy Shift


Under Pressure To Financially Engineer Results, CHD’s Two Recent And Expensive Deals Already Showing Signs of Disappointment 
 In August 2017, CHD spent $1 billion to acquire Waterpik, a dental water flossing product that has been flipped twice by private equity owners. From 


the deal conf call, management showed little understanding of the business, punting on simple questions such has what % of sales is online, and the 
split of kit vs. consumable sales. When we asked a former long-time executive about the deal: “Waterpik has been for sale for years, and I’m a bit 
surprised they bought it given product liability concerns”


 Sales Decline Quickly Post Acquisition: CHD obscured the contribution of sales by Waterpik post acquisition, lumping results in consumer domestic 
and international with smaller acquisitions Anusol and Viviscal. However, total consumer revenues from acquisitions declined from $102m (Q4’17), 
to $85m (Q1’18), to $79m (Q2’18) in the following quarters that can be cleanly analyzed. The FDA also recalled products mid 2018 for safety issues


 Margins Already Failing: Documents show Waterpik’s gross margins were 47.7% - 49.1% pre-acquisition, and the CFO said he expected 200-300bp 
gross margin expansion. Fast forward to early 2019, the CFO’s recent comment that gross margins are now “on par” with the company’s gross 
margin (pre-China tariffs), indicate that margins have contracted lower and are now closer to 44%

With Recent

Old School Brands Traditionally Following A Copy-Cat Like Strategy Against Leaders Proctor & Gamble, Clorox, And Others
 Best known for its iconic Arm & Hammer brand, CHD embarked on an acquisition strategy in the early part of the 2000s to diversify into condoms, sex 


toys, hair care, rectal cream, vitamin gummies, oral care and other assorted product categories. However, we believe 6 out of 10 of its “Power 
Brands” acquired pre-2017 are struggling or outright failures


 With 23% of sales through Wal-Mart, and reliance on struggling brick-and-mortar channels such as ULTA, Sally Beauty, Bed, Bath & Beyond, 
pharmacy (ex: Walgreens, CVS, Rite Aid), and discount stores, we believe CHD is experiencing channel pressures, and has been slow to transition 
to online sales and marketing to millennials. These factors, along with an increasingly promotional environment, has been pressuring margins


 Long promising international growth opportunities, CHD hasn’t been strategic about acquiring brands that can readily be sold in foreign markets (most 
notably vitamins) and has failed to implement common sense strategies (e.g., multilanguage labeling) to accelerate and scale the “export” strategy.  
Our research indicates that recent international success is attributable to new market entries, establishing distribution agreements and putting through 
significant price increases.  We don’t believe that any of these drivers are sustainable and that CHD is now too late to many of its core product 
categories around the world.  As a result, we believe that international growth is likely to disappoint


Investors Fail To Appreciate The Change of Leadership Style Under Matt Farrell, An Executive Who Blind-Sided Investors At Alpharma
 In early 2016, Matt Farrell and Rick Dierker were appointed CEO and CFO, respectively. Based on our interviews of former employees in key roles, 


CHD experienced a culture shift that would deemphasis manufacturing, R&D and supply chain investment in favor of greater financially engineered 
acquisitions. One former employee even described management as “financial magicians” 


 We believe investors fail to appreciate the abysmal failure overseen by Farrell when CFO of Alpharma (formerly NYSE: ALO). While we 
acknowledge that some of Alpharma’s issue may have pre-dated his arrival in 2002, there is evidence that under Farrell’s leadership, the situation 
became even worse, culminating in Alpharma issuing more material weaknesses, a “non-reliance” opinion on its financial statements, a covenant 
breach, and later a DOJ settlement for bad sales and payment practices to promote unsafe products


 Now as the CEO, and in a position to reap large gains, our behavioral analysis shows both Farrell and CFO Dierker are using highly promotional 
language to talk up deals, while evidence points to financial control and accounting challenges, most notably to game bonus compensation targets

Spruce Point Estimates 35% – 50% Downside Risk


Scrutiny of
Related Party 
Joint Venture 


Armand Products 
Shows Problematic 


Accounting Designed 
To Inflate Financials


Spruce Point Has Identified Many Flaws In The Flawless Acquisition That Should Give Investors Grave Concerns
 In May 2019, CHD announced it acquired FLAWLESS hair care removal product for $450m. The product has grown quickly to $180m of sales 


since its 2017 launch, but has unproven staying power in a rapidly maturing category. Management is using bold and potentially misleading 
language to promote the deal, even claiming to be creating a “brand new category” for an “unmet need” and that it will “blow out” sales 


 A former CHD executive told us bluntly the deal was, “Horrible, Horrible, oh Horrible” and should be “Dumped” immediately
 The seller is managing the business under an opaque long-term service agreement that allows it to reap another $475m of incentives through 


an earnout agreement that still allows it to get paid if targets aren’t achieved
 Spruce Point finds undeniable evidence of aggressive accounting, revenue recognition problems, and operational delays at FLAWLESS: 


Notably, we have sourced Nielsen retail data for recent FLAWLESS product introductions. The data shows slowing growth for its headline 
Finishing Touch FLAWLESS brand, and rapid maturation cycles historically for new product introductions. FLAWLESS and CHD’s Batiste are 
sold at ULTA Beauty, which just cut guidance, and said recent new product cycles in women’s cosmetics are not driving growth


Spruce Point Has Documentary Evidence That CHD Controls A Related Party Entity That Inflates Its Financials
 In 1986, CHD formed Armand Products, a 50/50 joint venture with Occidental Petroleum to produce and market potassium (bi)carbonite. We 


believe the transaction was motivated to shift, potentially environmentally challenged, assets off CHD’s balance sheet
 In Spruce Point’s opinion, CHD’s current equity method accounting treatment is at best highly aggressive, and at worst outright flawed. By 


applying the equity method, it avoids consolidating an entity it appears to control. Under full consolidation, we believe CHD’s operating 
margins, working capital, and free cash flow would all be lower due to the heavy manufacturing aspects of the business


 Evidence of control includes: JV formation documents showing key management and the Board all being CHD members, current 
management’s operation of the business from CHD’s office, and receiving a management fee for administrating the entity, CHD appears to be 
the largest related party purchaser from the business, and the business has been run under an obscured CHD legal entity


 We believe the JV has been under pressure, with deteriorating margins. We estimate Armand has ~$100m of revenues and CHD accounts 
for 15% – 25% of sales. We conservatively estimate that JV accounting treatment allows CHD to inflate EBITDA by $13 - $27m and free cash 
flow by $5 - $10m.  While small in context of today’s CHD’s overall business, years ago when it was formed, it was highly material, and 
illustrates the aggressive methods management has used to inflate performance. We believe a full restatement is necessary


More Subtle Evidence 
of Financial Strain:


Low-Quality 
Organic Revenue And 
Cash Flow Sources; 


Misrepresented 
EBITDA


Greater Desperation 
Evident In The 


Flawless Acquisition


CHD Touts Its Industry Leading Cash Conversion >100% of Net Income, But It’s Not As Sexy As It Appears
 Aggressive M&A Accounting: On average, CHD accounts for 96% of its deal values as intangibles and goodwill, enabling it to receive tax 


deductions over 15yrs that improve cash flow. As an example of how aggressive management has been towards applying this strategy, it said 
on the FLAWLESS conference call that it had no synergies, yet later marked $82m of the value as goodwill and attributed it to synergies! 


 Increased Factoring: CHD factors receivables, and by its own admission in 2015, its cash flow should be adjusted for it. Ever since, CHD has 
obscured its factoring programs, and only reports it annually. In May 2019, CHD increased its factoring program from $150 to $250m 


 Cash Conversion Limitations: After steadily improving from 2014 to 2017, the metric worsened in 2018. It bottomed in Q3’17 at 15 days and 
now stands at 24 days. Nonetheless, the CFO touts that it has a 3 – 4 year plan to drive working capital to zero. When we asked former 
employees if this was achievable, a few snickered at the suggestion, and all agreed it was a “stretch”


 Slowing Dividend Growth: CHD has a history of annual dividend increases. In early 2019, it increased the dividend by just 4.6%, the lowest in 
history. We believe this is a signal of management’s weakening confidence in its cash flow outlook


 Undisclosed M&A: We find that CHD completed an undisclosed acquisition in the UK in Q1’2018 that bolstered organic growth
 Inflated EBITDA: CHD’s uses a misleading presentation of its Credit Agreement EBITDA by not adjusting for two key non-cash items

Grievances:


Evidence That 
Management Is 


Fleecing Investors 
By Manipulating 
Compensation 


Targets 
And 


Obscured Stock 
Sales By The Chief 
Accounting Officer


A Terrible Risk / Reward With An Implied 8% Downside To The Average Analyst Price Target
 In our experience, when stocks trade above the average analyst price target, it represents a unique short opportunity. Recent examples include 


Penumbra, iRobot and Mettler Toledo. In the case of CHD, a majority of the analysts are Neutral/Hold on the stock, and the Street high price 
targets is $88. Three directors recently sold stock around $79 to $80/share in the last two weeks of August and early September 


 CHD’s valuation multiple has expanded rapidly to all-time highs, partly explained by sector rotation into “defensive” consumer staples as global 
instability and trade wars escalate, and partly on investors’ belief that new management can competently steer the Company for sustained 
growth and implement improvements to fix 2018’s challenges. We believe both of these are poor reasons to own CHD:


• Safety From Trade Wars: CHD is exposed to China tariffs primarily through its Waterpik business. In addition, CHD wants to expand more 
globally, especially into China, notably through a new distribution arrangement with Shanghai Jahwa. Lastly, instability in Hong Kong is another 
potential underappreciated headwind. We find that 22% of CHD’s imports come through Hong Kong and China, by far its largest import region


• Competent Management: As discussed and documented, we believe management is hyper promotional, potentially deceptive and highly 
aggressive at inflating the financials to maximize its self-interested compensation objectives. We believe its focus on financial engineering 
versus operational and product enhancement will result in failing to achieve long-term margin and organic growth objectives


 CHD’s stock is valued at 5x, 22x, and 32x 2019E Sales, EBITDA, and EPS – a significant premium to its peers for a few extra percentage points 
of potential growth, which we believe will fail to materialize. The risk / reward is not favorable in light of our bona fide evidence of dubious related 
party accounting that could necessitate a financial restatement and issuance of a non-reliance statement on its financials


 Valuing CHD at peer multiples on our normalized financials to reflect its mediocre brand portfolio, weak management, substandard governance 
practices, and failing acquisition strategy, we can justify a price range of $40 – $52 (35% – 50% downside)  


With Little Equity At Risk, Management Appears To Have Turned To Gaming Compensation Targets For Self-Enrichment Purposes
 CHD insiders own just 2% of the stock and have little at risk if the company fails. Spruce Point finds it highly unusual that all its executive officers 


serve at the discretion of the Board except Steven Katz, the Financial Controller and Chief Accounting Officer, who serves at the discretion of 
Farrell, who is both Chairman and CEO. Moreover, as the longest serving executive employee having been hired in 1986 (ironically the same 
time the questionable Armand JV was formed), Katz is selling stock in an oblique manner that circumvents disclosure best practices


 CHD’s annual cash incentive plan is tied to net sales, gross margins, diluted EPS, and operating cash flow. None of these targets are adjusted 
for management’s tricks being used to inflate performance. The most egregious example is gross margin and Diluted EPS:


• Gross margin: CHD did not call out an inventory accounting method change as a 10bp benefit to gross margin in 2018. The timing of the 
change in 2018 is curious, given that headline gross profit contracted 140bps. Yet, management still exceeded its threshold gross profit level for 
its annual incentive compensation calculation with unexplained adjustments. By our calculation, CHD failed to meet the target threshold by 
adjusting for the accounting change


• Diluted EPS: A more egregious example is its Diluted EPS calculation. CHD’s 2017 acquisition of Agro BioScience started underperforming, 
and it reversed the earnout liability down in 2018, which boosted earnings by $7.5m. Shareholders should be appalled that management reaped 
bonuses for hitting its EPS target, yet the Board (controlled by Farrell) didn’t adjust EPS downward for a failed deal and an accounting change 


• Overall: CHD proclaimed great performance in 2018, going so far as to reward employees and management with a special 15% bonus. This is 
a complete charade in light of collapsing margins, failed deals, subtle accounting changes, and numbers that don’t add up


• Recommendation: Spruce Point believes Farrell’s CEO/Chairman role should be divided, and management should return unjustly earned 
compensation. In addition, the Board should institute new metrics tied to organic sales growth (not poorly acquired revenue), and adjust future 
EPS targets for share repurchases which reward management for boosting EPS by overpaying for CHD’s expensive stock
10


Irrational Share Price Expansion 


CHD’s share price is inflated to an all-time high, and irrational valuation, as, we believe: 1) investors flock to the perceived safety of 
consumer staples amidst rising trade war tensions, 2) a belief that recent acquisitions will succeed in accelerating growth, and 3) 


recent price increases enacted to offset commodity inflation and tariffs can be reimplemented if necessary. 
Our report will illustrate why none of these are valid reasons for owning CHD.

“Bull Case” Rests on Misguided 
Assumptions


While most analysts are Hold / Market perform, a select few are bullish, and see upside to the mid $80s. One such 
analyst is Jefferies, with an $86 price target. We’ve deconstructed the “Key Tenants” of its Buy rating. 


Bull: “Strong Management” 
Bear: Promotional and weak management, resorting to 
potentially misrepresenting results to reap unjust comp.
CEO Farrell has a history of failure at Alpharma


Bull: “Best-In-Class M&A”
Bear: Legacy “Power Brand” deals 
have been failures. Current deals are 
already showing signs of failure


Bull: “High EPS Visibility”
Bear: Low visibility with increasing risks 
in China and Hong Kong. Management 
resorting to burying one-time items 
(accounting changes + earnout 
reversals) to boost EPS. Smallest 
dividend increase in recent history 
shows weak cash flow outlook


Bull: “Superior FCF Conversion”
Bear: Inferior FCF. Overstated by not 
consolidating JV capex, factoring of 
receivables, and aggressive marking 
of acquisition goodwill and 
intangibles for tax deductions 


Bull: “Attractive Valuation”
Bear: Three recent directors sold at 
$79 - $80/sh. Trades at a large 
premium to peers for a few 
percentage points of organic growth 
of suspect quality and sustainability


Bull: “Widening 
Org(anic) Sales Gap 
vs. Peers”
Bear: Aggressive price 
increases announced 
in Q3’18 set to lapse.

Rising Debt Amidst Low Quality EBITDA 
And Unknown True Leverage


CHD is a BBB+ / Baa1 credit and touts its $2.7bn borrowing capacity for more transactions while maintaining investment grade,
and producing >3.0% organic revenue growth. Headline Debt / 2020E EBITDA of 2.3x is likely closer to 2.7x after our conservative
adjustments. However, we believe CHD’s organic revenue growth is fleeting and low quality, illustrated by revenue control issues


we’ve identified with calculating acquisition contribution, and its willingness to conduct undisclosed acquisitions. Recent 
acquisitions have also proven to underperform post-closing, necessitating even greater acquisitions to fill the void. Furthermore, 


the true state of CHD’s leverage and free cash flow is unknown given its financial obfuscation of Armand Products, a 
manufacturing and capex intensive JV operation with Occidental Petroleum in Muscle Shoals, Alabama – a location with known 


environmentally challenging conditions that necessitated Occidental to shutter nearby plants.(1) 
We call on the Board to suspend its acquisition strategy post a through review of management’s recent transactions.

Worrisome Strategy Shift, And A 
CEO With A Concerning History
14


Worrisome Shift In CHD’s 
Culture And Strategy


As part of our research process, Spruce Point talked with various former long-time employees of CHD. A uniform opinion is that 
the culture has changed under CEO Farrell and CFO Dierker more towards a culture of financial engineering, and less towards 


product innovation and improvement. As our report will painstakingly detail, we believe this is a negative development with 
glaring signs that management has gone too far towards financial and accounting mismanagement and insider enrichment. 


Growth Driver #1: M&A


Under CEO Jim Craigie (Old-School Kraft Executive)
Marketing-Driven Executive Focused On Acquiring Complementary Products


1. Replicate competing premium consumer products at a value price point


2. Acquire brands that complement CHD’s existing brands and scale in 
distribution


Growth Driver #2: Organic Growth


Strategy Since 2016: Financial-Driven M&ALegacy Strategy: Focus on Products, Supply Chain Integration


Under CEO Matt Farrell (Former CFO) and CFO Rick Dierker (Ex-Ingersoll Rand)
Decentralized “HoldCo” Approach To M&A, Limited Focus On Product / Brand Fit


1. Pay high prices for unproven products (FLAWLESS) or challenged products 
which fit poorly into CHD portfolio (Waterpik)


2. Little effort to integrate supply chain, distribution, R&D effort, etc.


Management focused on coherent product offering, strong marketing, and supply 
chain / distribution strength


Strategy Since 2016: Focus On M&ALegacy Strategy: Prioritizing “Power Brands”


Financially-driven management team targeting growth through financial 
engineering via M&A. With recent deals struggling, CHD must constantly replenish 


growth with more deals


Growth Driver #3: International Business


Management focused primarily on strength in North America.
Acquisitions (e.g. gummy vitamins) not tailored to foreign markets.


Strategy Since 2016: Recent Growth, But Sustainable?Legacy Strategy: International Business Deemphasized


Growth attributable to entering new markets / distribution channels and putting 
through significant price increases. Drivers likely not sustainable in the longer-


term. Talking-up China opportunities during prolonged trade wars

We Believe The Shift From Jim Craigie To Matt Farrell 
Has Materially Increased The Risks To Investors


Since Matt Farrell has assumed the helm at Church & Dwight, the Company’s future growth has become 
increasingly dependent on management’s ability to successfully acquire high growth brands and present its 


financials in the most attractive light.  Given current management’s weak overall track record of acquisitions and a 
dependence on financial engineering, we think investors should reset expectations about Church & Dwight’s 


potential earnings growth and the quality of earnings.

Sordid Background of CEO Farrell


In our opinion, Church & Dwight’s CEO Matt Farrell is no rock-star. He would love to bury his past as CFO at Alpharma (NYSE: 
ALO), but Spruce Point thought it worthwhile to investigate. While we acknowledge that some of these issue may have pre-dated 
his arrival, there is evidence that under his leadership the business got progressively worse, culminating in a “non-reliance” on 


Alpharma’s financial statements, multiple restatements, material weaknesses, a DOJ Federal investigation and a covenant breach.


Date Event Timeline
April 2002 Farrell appointed EVP and CFO of Alpharma Inc. 


Feb 2004
Subsequent to the date of this report, as part of the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2003, the Company's auditors communicated to the 
Company's management and Audit Committee two reportable conditions in the internal controls of the USHP division that, when viewed collectively, constitute a material 
weakness in the Company's internal controls. 


March 2004
The Company is presently being sued by the State of Massachusetts alleging fraud in connection with these state Medicaid programs and has been notified by several 
additional states that it is the subject of investigations related to the same subject matter.


May 2004
Alpharma amends SEC filings. Financial statements for 2003 are being restated to adjust inventory costs related to a vendor contract that was subject to an amendment and 
letter of intent in January 2003 ("2003 amendment"). The 2003 amendment included a provision that permitted the vendor, under certain circumstances, to retroactively 
invoice the company for inventory purchases since January 2003 at a higher price


Feb 2005
On February 16, 2005, Alpharma Inc. (the "Company") was notified by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP ("PwC"), the Company's independent registered public accounting firm, 
that PwC would decline to stand for re-election as the Company's independent registered public accounting firm at the Company's upcoming 2005 Annual Meeting of 
Stockholders


April 2005


In connection with its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2004, the Registrant identified the following internal 
control deficiencies:  Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy or the review and monitoring of customer discount reserves and certain accrual accounts 
affecting a number of accounts in the U.S. Generic Pharmaceuticals business, including revenues, accounts receivables and accrued expenses, were not maintained at 
December 31, 2004. Effective controls to ensure the completeness and accuracy of income tax account balances, including the determination of deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities, income taxes payable, and income tax expense, were not maintained. In connection with the Registrant's disclosure in the Prior 8-K that it did not have effective 
controls over the determination of proper segment disclosures in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 


April 2005 


The Company has determined that it was not in compliance at December 31, 2004 and 2003 with certain debt covenants related to its 8 5/8% Senior Notes due 2011(the 
"Senior Notes") relating to the timely payments of liquidated damages due to its Senior Note holders and timely filing of certain certificates required in the covenants to the 
Senior Notes at December 31, 2004 and 2003.  As a result of these defaults, on April 28, 2005, the Company's management concluded that the previously issued financial 
statements for 2003 and 2004 should no longer be relied upon.  As a result of the defaults described above, the Company's has concluded that an additional material 
weakness in internal control over financial reporting existed as of December 31, 2004. Specifically, the Company did not maintain effective controls to ensure the appropriate 
review and monitoring of its compliance with certain of its debt covenants at December 31, 2004.


Aug 2006 Farrell resigns as CFO


Dec 2006
SEC Comment Letter: We believe that your disclosure related to estimates of items that reduce gross revenue such as product returns, chargebacks, customer rebates and 
other discounts and allowances could be improved as follows, please provide us the following 


Feb 2007
On February 28, 2007, the Company received a subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice requesting certain documents relating to KADIAN. The subpoena did not 
disclose any allegations underlying this request. The Company intends to cooperate with the Department


March 2010
DOJ Settlement: The settlement resolves allegations that, between January 1, 2000 and December 29, 2008, Alpharma paid health care providers to induce them to promote 
or prescribe Kadian, and made misrepresentations about the safety and efficacy of the drug, which is used to treat chronic moderate to severe pain.

Like Most “Power Brands” Acquired In the 
Past, Expect CHD’s Recent Deals To Fail…


Among CHD’s reported “Power Brands” all have been acquired since 2001 except for the back bone Arm & Hammer brand. Spruce Point believes that 6 of 10 
acquisitions should be categorized as failures. Based on our forensic and fundamental review, we believe that CHD’s two most recent power brand 


acquisitions in 2017-19 of Waterpik and FLAWLESS under new management should also be deemed failures, though management has yet to acknowledge the 
challenges being faced. Most tuck-in acquisitions (Agro Bioscience/Passport) under new management have also been failures. 


Brand/Category Spruce Point 
Long-Term View

Recent Deal Summary


Based on our research and conversations, we believe recent acquisitions executed under Farrell and Dierker have been poorly 
planned and executed, and more aggressively structured (notably with earnouts) – insult to injury given the large multiples paid
for these deals and rising debt load to fund the deals. As the recent deals underperform, we believe management will be under


greater pressure to find even larger deals to fill the hole, and may exacerbate its situation by paying even larger premiums

Former Executives Didn’t Pull Punches About 
The Changing State of The Business 


Former Long Time Supply Chain Employee


Former Long Time Senior Country Leader


“I think under Jim’s era obviously we acquired companies that we brought value to it, especially through our supply chain expertise or resources. Whether it's logistics, 
warehouse distribution or just internal manufacturing, that was a key priority or key part of it. So we always made acquisitions based on obviously the financial return, but a 
lot of it was based on, what is the internal supply chain, marketing or any kind of a resource that would be a good synergy in this kind of acquisition. Rather, currently a lot 
of the acquisitions that are happening, it's not taking or leveraging our internal supply chain, R&D or even marketing for that matter. A lot of these products are being 
acquired strictly as a financial tool and we are leaving both entities separate and independent. And it's almost like in a very loosely speaking terms, I would say that 
instead of becoming an integrated supply chain team, it's more of a holding company.” 


“Current focus is not how are we going to improve our supply chain, modernize our plant or embark on some very sophisticated robotic automation. It's almost like keep it 
the way it is, maintain costs or reduce cost as you can and our growth will come with this niche areas, whether it's animal nutrition or Batiste and continue to grow in that 
value brand, which will be supported by that low cost margin. So nothing I would say is sexy in that core business that we've been doing.  It’s the acquisition that's 
bringing in those financial leverage and that's basically the growth arm.”


“So, you know, I wouldn't have expected to see far greater strides in that area [reference to financial discipline under Matt/Rick]. Personally, I think the thing that changed in 
the culture or the shift was the lot, and again, I don't know what came first, the chicken or rice.  I'm not trying to make this, you know, Matt problem versus a Jim problem. 
But yeah. You know, we lost the culture, lost the focus on brand and innovation and speed to market as far as I'm concerned. Like it really went, the pendulum went from 
one extreme to another and there's a lot of reasons for that. So then we saw the acquisition train pick up some momentum, but I wouldn't necessarily say from my 
perspective that the acquisitions made, we're all quote unquote smart.” 


“So I guess I've kind of alluded in my point, if it looks good on paper [financially motivated acquisitions], mathematically yes. But again, you know, coming from a 
commercial perspective, you know, it's hard to convince the retail trade that the math makes good business sense because the customers sell brands, sell product 
solutions, they sell innovation, they, you know, they're consumer centric. So those two things didn't marry up in all cases. There were acquisitions that were made, you 
know, maybe unfair, but since you've done your research and you already are very much aware, but an acquisition like Topix or Viviscal, made good financial sense, but there 
was no long term sustainable strategy.”
Evidence of Intensifying 
Financial Strain

Daily Challenges


Fighting for shelf space in an intensely competitive market, we find CHD’s products do not generally command the best locations,
and are often placed side-by-side generic house brands or at the bottom rack. While management has suggested the promotional 


environment has moderated, we see retailers being very promotional to move CHD’s various brands.

Dividend Growth Slowing


We find it concerning that CHD’s 2019 dividend grew at the slowest rate in recent history. We believe this is a signal of 
weakening cash flow expectations. Yet, CHD proclaimed great performance in 2018, going so far as to reward 


employees and management with a special 15% bonus. However, our forensic analysis will show how management 
rigged certain financial performance metrics in its favor to flatter results, and extract excessive compensation.  Certain 


models tie share price valuation to dividend growth rate. As a result, it makes little sense to Spruce Point why CHD’s 
valuation multiple is at an all-time high with the dividend growth rate slowing.

2011 $0.0850 $0.34 100.0%


2012 $0.1200 $0.48 41.2%

Source: CHD


We achieved extraordinary results by delivering EPS growth of 17 percent, and we delivered extraordinary TSR of 33.2 percent,
which was in the top 10 percent of our TSR Peer Group. As a result, management recommended, and the Committee approved, 
a special 15 percent discretionary bonus payout to reward all employees (including the named executive officers) for their 
significant contributions toward these strong achievements in 2018.

Worsening Cash Conversion


There’s more evidence of cash flow strain by looking at CHD’s cash conversion cycle (it defines as DSO + DIO – DPO). 
After steadily improving from 2014 to 2017, the metric worsened in 2018 from 17 to 24 days. Nonetheless, the CFO 


touts that it has a 3 – 4 year plan to drive working capital to zero. Good luck: according to our research, former 
employees describe this goal as a stretch.


Source: CHD


And speaking of cash or free cash flow conversion right, free cash flow divided by net income was 124%. If you look back at our 
track record, we've averaged over 120% for quite some time. Other peers averaged around 90% and many companies target at 
100%. This is a big difference between Church & Dwight and the rest of the peer group. And how do we do that? Well, partly it's 
because of working capital management. Over the last 10 years, we've gone from 52 days cash conversion cycle to around 20 
days cash conversion cycle. And we have plans just like our productivity program, where we have a three-year pipeline, we do 
the same thing for working capital. So, we have a three-year plan, four-year plan to get down to zero over time.

Greater Factoring = Weaker Cash Flow


CHD has not been fully transparent about its accounts receivable factoring program. At first in 2015, it admitted that 
cash flow should be adjusted for the factoring. As program usage intensified, management stopped calling out the 
impact of factoring, and kept proclaiming working capital improvements and impressive cash flow growth. In May 
2019, management increased the size of the facility from $150 to $250m, but buried the detail in an 8-K and didn’t 


mention the increased capacity in the 10-Qs(1). Management also does not provide quarterly detail about its factoring, 
opting instead to disclose program usage annually.

Cash Flow Hype Creates Perverse 
Incentive To Overpay For Deals


The CEO touts the Company’s excellent cash flow. But in reality, it appears driven by CHD’s aggressive acquisition strategy, 
which assigns a significant portion of the deal value to goodwill and intangible assets (“G&I”). For recent deals identified as tax 


deductible for U.S. purposes, 96% of deal value has been ascribed to G&I. CHD’s strategy creates perverse incentives to overpay 
for deals to mark-up G&I to drive greater tax deductions. Deductibility is over 15 years.

Resorting To Undisclosed Acquisitions To 
Boost Organic Growth?


Warning: Management has engaged in acquisitions that have gone undisclosed to investors. We found that in early 2018, it 
made an acquisition of “one major brand” benefiting Church & Dwight UK Ltd, presumably for the Consumer International 
segment. Though on the surface, adding sales by acquisition for over $1m may seem inconsequential, it supports our belief that 
management’s financial tactics to boost organic growth are becoming more aggressive. The only acquisition in early 2018 was 
Passport Food, recorded in the SPD segment, and a domestic U.S. business that is not a brand business.

Historical EBITDA Inflation Used As A 
Base-Line For Future Estimates


We believe the Street has failed to capture accounting gimmicks to boost CHD’s 2018 EBITDA. Analysts simply take CHD’s 
recent annual results at face value, and use it as a base-line for future year EBITDA growth and margin expansion.

Note: Spruce Point does not agree with Bloomberg’s add-backs. CHD’s has taken 
repeated annual asset impairment charges that are not simply one-time items. In 
addition, the $3.5m “merger expense”, upon further inspection, is an unusual and 
unexplained adjustment in Q1’18 to marketing expense that CHD would later drop 
from subsequent earnings releases and has not discussed in 10-Q or 10-K filings 
(Q1: source Q4: source).

Misleading EBITDA Per Its Credit Agreement


Source: Credit Agreement, 8-K: March 29, 2018 


In our opinion, management has misrepresented an accurate picture of Adj. EBITDA to investors. On the prior slide, we illustrated how 
management buried two unusual non-cash items that increased EBITDA by $11.5 million. Per CHD’s credit agreement, consolidated 


EBITDA must be adjusted lower by “non-cash items increasing Consolidated Net Income” and “any extraordinary, unusual, or non-recurring 
cash income or gains”. However, management shows investors a calculation of Adj. EBITDA that does not deduct these adjustments.

Anything But A FLAWLESS Acquisition


Suspicious 
Long Term Service 


Agreement


 Long-term services agreement with seller Idea Village to continue to manage the FLAWLESS brand
 CEO on Deal Call: “So, they will be handling the day-to-day operation of the business. Every aspect of the business, whether 


it's sales, marketing, R&D, supply chain, we will bring to bear any and all help we can to make them even more successful. 
But they are the front end of the business. We own it, but together, we're going to run it.”


 CEO on Deal Call: “We wouldn’t disclose the terms of the service agreement other than to say that it's multi-year”
 Suspicious delayed capital outlay and mismatch between “cash earnings and cash flow”
 CFO Q1 2019 Conf Call: “From a cash perspective, the expected increase in cash earnings 4% accretion is offset by a one-


time inventory purchase at the end of the transition period and a onetime working capital build, which will be approximately 
$30 million in total. As a result, the full year effect of the acquisition on 2019 operating cash flow is neutral”


Huge Earnout That 
Sellers Win For Not 


Hitting Targets


 Announced March 2019: $475m in cash plus an earnout payment up to $425m. CHD isn’t disclosing the earnout terms
 Promoting big sales goals of 15% per annum, but evidence already shows they are having trouble calculating revenues
 CFO on Deal Conf Call Shows Product Has Limited Visibility: “We just said that, look, we believe that this deal is going to be 


cash-accretive in 2020 as well, but this is just way too early to talk about 2020”
 Does not provide separate historical financial statements. CHD provided financials for Waterpik’s $1.0bn deal (2017)
 Sellers can still get paid for missing targets per the CFO on the Deal Conf Call: “So, if they get 90% of the target, then 90% of 


the target would be paid out.”


Unproven Product, 
Uncertain Market, 
Yet Management 


Hyping It Hard


 CEO on Deal Call: “The business has only been around for two years. I mean, the initial product was launched in June of 
2017 and that was the face product. And then the brow product was in mid-2018. So, the brand is only just getting started”


 CEO: “If you look at the size of the category, it's difficult to get your arms around it because probably half the category is in 
non-measured channel” – if you can’t measure it, how can you manage it?


 CEO: “This is a brand new category…We’re fulfilling an unmet need”; CFO: “We're going to blow this out internationally”
 Based on our retail channel checks we find terrible and inconsistent product placement in stores. At times, the product is 


placed near women’s hair care, and at other times with As Seen On TV products 
 The CEO claimed it has a “sizeable” patent portfolio, yet recent product labels clearly state “patent(s) pending”


Mounting Evidence of 
Aggressive Accounting 
and Financial Control 


Issues


 Free lunch accounting CFO Q1 2019 Conf Call: “During this period, operating results will be recorded in the company's 
net sales line, impacting many of our metrics as we detailed in the earnings release. For the remaining four months, 
FLAWLESS results will be consolidated within specific P&L line items”


 CFO on Deal Call: “We really don't expect material synergies over the next two, three, four years”; however, CHD later 
ascribed $87m of deal value to goodwill based on “expected synergies”


 Control Issues, Revised Statement on May 2nd (8-K): “The impact of FLAWLESS on the Company’s full year 2019 
results compared to 2018 is expected to be: Net Sales (+200 bps), Gross Margin (+20 bps), Marketing (-10 bps), and 
SG&A (+50 bps), rather than SG&A (-50 bps) as reported in the press release”


 Spruce Point Math: We find categorically undeniable evidence of figures not reconciling. 
 CFO on Q2 Conf Call: “Only good surprises” – yet a change in 10-Q language shows transition delays

A Product In An Increasingly Cluttered Space


The brand’s flagship product is a small, discreet “touch-up” razor designed to look like a female cosmetic product. FLAWLESS was perhaps the 
first to market with such a device, but it is certainly not the only player in the space today: as with Waterpik, an Amazon search for the brand 


name itself returns mostly non-FLAWLESS products. In fact, according to Amazon, the FLAWLESS product is not even the best-selling result on 
the page – nor is it the cheapest, nor the best-reviewed. At the top of the page, Amazon also recommends two competing products as the 


“Editor’s Choice” and the “Most Precise,” respectively. Both are cheaper and better-reviewed than the FLAWLESS product. After being the first to 
market, there is no indication whatsoever that the FLAWLESS product is in any way unique or preferred by customers.

Spruce Point has sourced valuable data from Nielsen, a recognized leader in consumer market research. It has tracked FLAWLESS brand sales 
through grocery stores, drug stores, mass channel (WalMart, Target), discount clubs (BJ’s / Sam’s), and both dollar and convenience stores. We 


find alarming evidence that shows the faddish nature of FLAWLESS’s brands, which have no more than a 3yr life cycle. Recent introductions, 
highlighted below, are currently showing signs of fatigue.

Pricing Pressure Already Apparent Soon After 
Product Releases


Despite having come to market only recently, FLAWLESS products are already experiencing pricing pressure from fierce competition. Amazon 
price trackers show that FLAWLESS recently cut the price of its Finishing Touch leg hair remover from $59.99 to $42.52 less than a year after first 
releasing the product. Even then, it remains 58% more expensive than its closest competition. The flagship FLAWLESS hair remover remains near 


its original price of $19.99, but is frequently discounted by anywhere from 25-40%.

Reality: Horrible Product Placement


Recent channel checks show that FLAWLESS receives terrible product placement on retail shelves. For instance, at Dollar General 
we found it in the back of the store near light bulbs, and not in women’s hair care or cosmetics in the front of the store. At Walmart, 


CHD’s largest customer, we found it in a temporary mid-aisle display, and not in a permeant location. Even worse, the product 
lacked a price tag. After having to track down a sales attendant, we learned it was priced at $15.00.

Horrible Product Placement (Cont’d)


CEO Farrell boldly claimed that FLAWLESS is a “brand new category”, yet retailers can’t seem to agree how best to position it on 
shelves.  At CVS, we found it on lower level shelves right next to competitive products from Conair, Braun, Remington and Phillips. 


Across the street at Rite Aid, we found it in the “As Seen on TV” section of the store. We believe that inconsistent product 
placement and messaging bodes poorly for long-term branding and consumer loyalty.

Warning From ULTA Beauty 


On August 29th, ULTA Beauty (Nasdaq: ULTA) blindsided investors with a guidance reduction. As a leading retailer of women’s cosmetics and 
related accessories, ULTA is a bellwether for category demand. The CEO’s comments about a soft cycle in cosmetics where recent product 


innovation has not driven expected growth should be a wake-up warning for CHD investors. FLAWLESS has proven to be a product with limited 
staying power and short-cycle demand. In fact, both FLAWLESS and Batiste are distributed through ULA.  


ULTA’s Shares Crash 30%


ULTA CEO
Q2 2019 


Conf Call


“We believe that the main issue driving this softer cycle in cosmetics is that the newness and innovation that have been the focus 
of most brands this year has just not driven the kind of incremental growth we've enjoyed for some period of time. Over the past 
several years, we've seen strong growth in cosmetics driven by new rituals and application techniques, like contouring and brow 
styling, and innovative new product formats like liquid lip, palettes and minis. This innovation resulted in new makeup routines
requiring new products which drove strong incremental growth. The most recent cycle of innovation has just not driven those 
behaviors resulting in a soft cycle for the cosmetics category in the U.S. as innovation and newness price the market has not
driven the expected growth.”

FLAWLESS Revenue Control Problems


Based on drivers of change in revenue for the 3 and 6 months ended June 2019, we find that FLAWLESS’ revenue contribution 
does not add up. It’s contribution to 2019 results should be equal under either calculation because the deal closed May 1, 2019.

CEO Spinning Excuses About FLAWLESS’ 
Performance 


Spruce Point’s concerns are mirrored by a sell-side analyst question. When questioned about the performance of 
FLAWLESS in Q2, the CEO engaged in evasive and dismissive language which suggests CHD is hiding something.   


Source: CHD Q2 2019 Conference Call


Hi. Good morning everyone. This is actually Cody on for Jason this morning. Thank you for taking our questions. Just 
want to stick on FLAWLESS for a little bit. On our math FLAWLESS boosted net sales by $7.4 million in the quarter, but 
was only there for about two months suggesting its full quarter sales were approximately $10 million. This came in 
below our expectations. How does this compare with the performance a year ago and relative to your expectations? 
And also what's the normal seasonality for this business?


Remember we didn't own it a year ago, number one. Number two, we generally do not comment on specific brand 
sales or factor sales within a quarter. I can tell you that they hit on number that we expected in Q2. We're very 
optimistic about full year as they continue to gain more traditional retail distribution.

CEO is dodging the question. It’s irrelevant if they 
owned it or not. CHD has FLAWLESS’ recent 


financial results that it based its purchase decision 
on, and should be able to explain results better


CEO is again being evasive and a false statement. By 
virtue of providing the acquisition contribution to 


growth, CHD did comment on the FLAWLESS’ brand!

CFO Spinning Half-Truths 


There is evidence that CHD is stretching the truth about the performance of FLAWLESS. When asked directly about 
any surprises, the CFO said “only good surprises”.  However, the evidence contradicts this with the integration taking 


longer than expected by a revision in the 10-Q. How can this be characterized as positive?


Source: CHD Q1 2019 10-Q, May 2, 2019


Okay. Great. And then my final question on the FLAWLESS acquisition now that you've owned it a few months any 
surprises as far in what you're seeing in the business?


Yeah. Only good surprises. Really it's a terrific business. We expected 15-plus percent sales growth and we should 
easily exceed that target in 2019.

Response


On May 1, 2019, the Company closed on its previously announced 
acquisition of the FLAWLESS™ and FINISHING TOUCH™ hair removal 


business (the “Flawless Acquisition”) from Ideavillage Products 
Corporation. The Company paid $475.0 at closing and will make an 
additional earn-out payment up to a maximum of $425.0 in cash, 


based on a trailing twelve-month net sales target ending no later than 
December 31, 2021. The transaction was funded with a three-year 


term loan and commercial paper borrowings. The Company 
anticipates there will be a four-month integration transition period 


in which the net cash received from Ideavillage will be accounted for 
as other revenue as a component of net sales. The Company will 


purchase the inventory following the transition period. FLAWLESS will 
be accounted for in the Consumer Domestic and Consumer 


International segments and represents an addition to our specialty 
haircare portfolio which includes BATISTE dry shampoo, VIVISCAL hair 


thinning supplements, and TOPPIK hair fibers.

Nothing Funny About It….


Even the CFO quips that the accounting is “funny”, but Spruce Point cannot reconcile what is going on. 


Source: CHD Q1 2019 Conference Call


And also a modeling question, if I can, just ask on the mechanics for the revenue recognition for FLAWLESS, because 
the old operator is still operating it. So I don't want to think -- it's not going to go, obviously, in organic growth. I was 
just wondering how to account for the different divisions and how it would be accounted in growth. Thank you.


It is. We said that business was $180 million trailing. If you times that by 15% you get low 200s. Divide that by 12 
months times it by eight months, since we closed on May 1, that's around $140 million. That's around 300-and-some 
basis points. But remember, the funny accounting is that, we could only recognize the operating profit and net sales 
for the first four months. And so it's really less than -- it's around half of that. So we can go through it in more detail if 
you like offline. But it's -- that's why it's less than maybe what you think.

A bizarre circumstance indeed. With what CHD 
described as a “long-term service agreement” why 


is there a stub period treated differently 


CHD has said FLAWLESS has 30% EBITDA margins. 
When asked specifically about the difference 


between EBIT and EBITDA on the deal conf call, 
the CFO didn’t give a straight answer and deflected 
by saying “Very asset-light, maybe some molds but 


very immaterial”

Is CHD A Government Tax Dodger?


I actually said that we really don't expect material synergies over the next two, three, four years because we do have a service 
agreement in place…. we're not calling or quantifying any synergies because we're focused on just – like Matt said, making them hit their 
$900 million earn-out and have the support that Church & Dwight would give and innovation that those guys would have

It’s a huge red flag when management says one thing and does another. The CFO specifically said there would be no deal synergies
for at least four years, yet it assigned $88m to goodwill, which it is using to reduce U.S. taxes and underpay the IRS. 


We believe he was referring specifically to operational synergies. Furthermore, CHD is touting a ready-made pipeline of near-term 
products under development to drive sales growth. Yet, if this is the case, why is there no capitalized cost for product development 


on CHD’s balance sheet to support his claim? If these products are feasible, they should be tangible and accountable. 


CEO on Deal 
Conf Call

The acquisition comes with a pipeline of new products to drive double-digit sales growth... There is a robust innovation pipeline
that comes along with the business. So it's not a one-trick pony. We got things coming up in 2020 – 2021

CEO Exaggerating Patent Protections


When asked about patent protections for FLAWLESS, the CEO boldly responded it has a “sizeable” patent portfolio.
It didn’t take much work to call this statement into question. The back of recent packages say “Patent Pending” and 


the popular Finishing Touch lipstick design patent wasn’t filed until April 6, 2018 after the CEO’s statement.(1)


Okay. Fair enough. And then lastly if I could just, is there anything you can help us on in terms of what is the replacement 
cycle for these products, granted it's a new category? But is there any feel for what the replacement cycle is or has 
been and anything you might have in terms of IP protection, patent protection on the intellectual property that's in 
the market today?


Yes. They do have a sizable patent portfolio, not just in the U.S., but outside the U.S., largely design patents.
What's your other question, Steve, the first part of that?

Insiders Vote Big With Large Stock Sales 
Ahead of, And After, The Passport Deal


The facts point to CHD’s Chairman unloading substantial stock just days ahead of the Passport acquisition. The deal, structured 
with a $25m earnout tied to sales, shows the promise of upside to CHD investors. Passport’s sales were disclosed at $21m in 


2017, but we will illustrate why it is meaningless towards giving investors future assurance of performance. Stock sales continued 
to remain significantly elevated post the Passport deal.

Management Continues Averting 
Discussion of Online Sales Impact


In Q3 2018, CHD announced it would be raising prices on 30% of its product portfolio, including Waterpik. Yet when 
asked about pricing elasticity, management referenced studies conducted, without even mentioning the effect of 


online sales.


Yes. Yes, Steve, it's a good question. We bought the business last August. Not too long after we bought the business, we 
did some the elasticity studies with respect to pricing. And so we don't think there's going to be a significant downtick in 
volume, and it's a couple of intuitive reasons for that. One is the purchase cycle for Water Flosser is about kind of every 3
years. The second thing is that 60% of Water Flossers are purchased on a doctor's recommendation. And the last thing 
would be we're kind of like 98% share of the categories, so sort of are the category. So for those reasons, I think there is 
opportunity to increase price.

Waterpik: A Pressured Brand In A
Maturing Industry


As the first mover in the space, the Waterpik brand naturally gained strong visibility, and has since become synonymous with the
product category. Not surprisingly, however, the competitive landscape has grown increasingly crowded in recent years, with both


household name consumer product companies (Panasonic, Philips, etc.) and no-name copycat brands congesting the space. 
Indeed, of the first 14 search results for the generic term “water flosser” on Amazon, only one is a Waterpik, and more than half the 


results for an Amazon search of the term “Waterpik” itself are competing products.

Evidence of Waterpik Margin Erosion


Okay. And then if I might on the Waterpik, is Waterpik lower than average margin to the company at the gross level?

Q4 2018 Call
Feb 2019


Documents show Waterpik’s gross margins were 47.7% - 49.1% pre-acquisition, and the CFO said he expected 200 -
300bp gross margin expansion. Fast forward to early 2019, the CFO’s recent comment that gross margins are now “on 


par” with the company’s gross margin (pre-tariff), indicate that margins have contracted lower in this product line 
closer to 44% - and this even after price increases announced in Q3 2018!

CEO Inconsistent On Waterpik


One thing it was pretty obvious to us is that the consumer interests in gum health has become more in vogue. So, we 
bought the Waterpik business. The Waterpik business was growing rapidly prior to, to our acquisition. And what 
we said that we -- we see this business can grow high single digits for the foreseeable future


DB Conf
June 2019


There’s strong evidence the CEO doesn’t have a full grasp of Waterpik’s numbers, and recent growth is coming at the 
sacrifice of margin.


So first Waterpik. We're using the same basic model that has driven the success in the US by dropping professional 
endorsement, building consumer awareness and expanding distribution in key markets. So, our year-on-year growth 
rate for this business, in 2018 we delivered 22% growth. Year-to-date '19, we are running at about the same rate 
in excess of 20%. So, we see Waterpik as being more fuel for our growth engine and international.


So, yeah, this business has grown double-digit, 10% for the last couple of years, and the way it's done that is through 
household penetration; so, increased household penetration from around 17% in 2015 to 19% today. Now, how has it 
done that? It's done a super job with its dental professional network, so professional marketing, also DRTV, and also 
new product launches. So, it's early for us to say double-digit in the future, you know, I'd say 10% growth is not, for 
any business, sustainable long-term, but we would say, it's safe to say, we expect 4% growth sustainable going 
forward year after year. So that's how we think about growth.

Be careful! The CEO clearly can’t get his story straight in terms of Waterpik’s sustainable growth rate: first, citing 4% 
growth, then saying high single digit growth. Now he claims 20% growth, but doesn’t say what exactly he is referencing 
(units, sales, etc.) when throwing out big growth numbers. More importantly, he doesn’t say what is driving this record 
20% growth rate (price/volume, domestic vs. US). More importantly, is the growth coming at the sacrifice of margin? 


We believe margin is being eroded per the CFOs recent statement.

The Company holds a 50% ownership interest in both Armand and ArmaKleen, and reports income from these equity

is clear that equity income is trending lower.(1). We observe that CHD’s related purchases from Armand mysteriously 


dropped to a 6.5yr low at $14.6m and management fees (benefiting EBITDA through a reduction to SG&A) has increased 
even while underlying performance from these entities doesn’t appear to be improving. Investors beware!

2) During 2015, the Company impaired its remaining investment in Natronx and recorded a $17.0 charge.
3) Billed by CHD, and recorded as a reduction of SG&A. Spruce Point believes this should not benefit EBITDA particularly since JV income is shown below the line as non-operating

Shady Armand Products JV


Spruce Point believes CHD effectively controls Armand Products and is using the entity to inflate key financial metrics 
(gross margin, free cash flow, and working capital). CHD applies “Equity Method” accounting and runs 50% of the 
Company’s income below the line. However, there is evidence that suggests CHD effectively controls the business. 


Control is a key accounting concept that drives the consolidation determination.


The Management 
And Employees


 Armand Products does not appear to have any employees. The sales are conducted by various CHD 
employees in different geographic territories. The technical support is provided by two employees with 
an OXY email address


 The only current executive Spruce Point identified is the President, who is a long-time CHD employee
 CHD receives an annual management and administrative fee that it uses to reduce SG&A
 The fee has gone up every year, even as evidence points to substantial margin erosion

Location


 The President of the Company is located in CHD’s corporate office in Princeton, NJ
 This provides strong evidence that daily operation and oversight is squarely in control by CHD


 By Spruce Point’s estimate, CHD is major customer of Armand Products, potentially at substantially 
off-market prices
 Many years ago, CHD provided financials for Armand, but ceased in 1999. It warned that the 


financials might not reflect reality since products and services provided to it were at cost
 The current President’s biography boasts Armand has ~$100m of revenues 
 Based on purchasing disclosures in the past few years, we estimate 15% – 25% of Armand’s sales 


are to CHD


The Legal 
Structure / Board


 Armand Products is just its business operating name. The Company’s legal name has been Church & 
Dwight (C&D) Chemical Products, Inc. and was a listed subsidiary of CHD (now obscured)
 We sourced formation documents in Alabama from 1987, and find that from inception, all the 


Directors and Management were listed as Church & Dwight executives

Equity Method vs. Consolidation


In Spruce Point’s opinion, CHD’s current equity method accounting for its Armand Products business is highly 
aggressive, if not outright flawed, and allows it to avoid full consolidation of an entity it largely controls.  Under full 


consolidation, we believe CHD’s operating margins, working capital, leverage, and free cash flow would all be worse. 


Impact on 
Financials


Aggressive Current Accounting: 
Equity Method


Correct Accounting In Spruce Point’s View: 
Full Consolidation


Estimated Impact on CHD’s Financials


Operating 
Margins


Beneficial: CHD purchases from Armand Products, 
historically in the range of $20m+ per year, likely at below 
market prices, thus inflating gross margins. It also boosts 
its operating margins by $2.6m from receiving a special 
admin and billing fee


Negative: We believe that Armand’s gross margins are 
below CHD’s consolidated gross margins, and have been 
deteriorating over time. As a result, under full 
consolidation, CHD’s gross (and operating) margins would 
be much lower


With annual purchases that aren’t arms length in the 
range of $15 - $25m, we apply a mark-up of 30-40% and 
eliminate the $4.6m admin/mgmt fees benefit. Overall 
estimated impact lowers EBITDA by $13 - $27m (1)


Balance Sheet + 
Leverage


Beneficial: CHD only reports a line item called Equity 
Investments in Affiliates as a long-term asset on its 
balance sheet


Negative: We believe that by fully consolidating the JV, 
CHD would have to show all the operations assets and 
liabilities on its balance sheet. As a commodity product 
manufacturing business, we believe its working capital 
intensity would worsen CHD’s consolidated balance sheet


Difficult to analyze without knowing Armand’s debts. 
Importantly, what environmental liabilities may be 
associated with the operation


Impact on 
Cash Flow


Aggressive: Despite not consolidating Armand, CHD is 
running all its distributions from the JV through operating 
cash flow. Thus, despite presenting the entity as non-
operating on the income statement, it gets the full benefit 
of the operating cash flow. Note: CHD used to run all the 
cash flow through the investing section


By consolidating the entity, we believe CHD would be 
more justified in showing all the cash flow through 
operations


Impact on 
Free Cash Flow


Beneficial: Capex associated with Armand Products 
manufacturing does not go through CHD’s financial 
statements. As a result, free cash flow is overstated


Negative: Under consolidation, Armand’s capex would go 
through the investing section, and lower CHD’s overall 
free cash flow


With Armand’s sales estimated at $100m, and it being a 
more capital intensive manufacturing operation, 
subject to environmental evaluation, and having 
received EPA violations in the recent past, we estimate 
recurring capex of 5-7% of sales, or $5-$7m


Segment 
Reporting


Beneficial: Currently listed under the “Corporate” segment 
– consistent with a non-operating asset


Negative:  Results would go through the SPD – Specialty 
chemical products, and make this segment, which is 
currently under pressure, even worse


1) CHD collects both a $2.1 and $2.6m fee from ArmaKleen and Armand Products, respectively. We assume a 15% EBITDA margin on non-related party Armand sales

Evidence That CHD Controlled 
Armand Products From Inception 


Source: Alabama Business Records


Warning: From the earliest time of 
inception in 1986, the entity described 
as a “Joint Venture / Partnership 
Manufacturing” has listed as its 
Officers and Directors all of CHD’s key 
executives at the time including its 
CEO, CFO, Treasurer, and General 
Counsel. If this is truly a 50/50 joint 
venture as CHD describes, why is 
Occidental not represented here.

CHD Obscuring The JV’s Business Entity 
And Fails To Now Disclose Its Existence


Warning: Armand Products Company is not even its legal name! The real legal name is C&D 
Chemical Products, Inc. C&D = Church & Dwight. This appears to be more evidence that CHD 
controls Armand Products as a named subsidiary. Notice that by 2005, CHD changed its subsidiary 
disclosure to hide that the subsidiary is D/B/A “Doing Business As” Armand Products Co. 
Post 2010, CHD completely eliminated disclosure of the Delaware entity and it was liquidated.(1) 
Armand Products still exists, so what legal entity is being used to run it?

working out of CHD’s corporate office! A visit to Armand’s website even proves it maintains separate employees –


there are many CHD employees for sales by region, yet only two OXY employees for technical support.

73


Evidence of Margin Contraction


From the biography of Armand’s president previously illustrated, we know sales are ~$100m. Yet, as of CHD’s earliest 
10-K available on SEC.gov we see its sales in 1994 were $47m and peaked a year later at $50m in 1995. Gross margins 
were 38.4%, below the corporate level at 44.7%, but Armand’s net income margin was ~31% - substantially higher than 
consolidated profit margin that year of 1.2%. Fast forward to today, CHD reported just $9.2m of equity income in 2018, 


implying at least $18.4 of net income for equity affiliates. On a minimum of $100m of equity affiliated revenue, this 
implies a profit margin of 18%, or 13% margin contraction.(1)


Source: CHD 1995 10-K


Source: CHD 2018 10-K


1) Analysis excludes ArmaKleen. We cannot determine its sales. However, based on recent related sales of ArmaKleen, we believe the business has rapidly declined and not a material 
contributor. ArmaKleen was formed in 1999, and its partner Saftey-Kleen filed Ch 11 bankruptcy a few years later (source) 


Warning: CHD mysteriously stopped providing break-out financials of Armand after 1999, making the entity even more 
opaque. It wasn’t until 2005 that CHD started disclosing intercompany sales with Armand and its invoicing for 
management and administrative services (2005)

Manipulative Cash Flow To Reap Unjust 
Bonuses


CHD’s annual incentive plan is based on four equal financial factors. We will show how CHD manipulates every single 
metric to its advantage. Evidence points to management padding its cash flow metric for bonus calculations by adding 


back factored receivables in 2018.


CHD reported $763.6m of operating cash flow in 2018. Yet, according to its bonus calculation, actual performance was $771m. 
So is it claiming better cash flow performance? The difference of $7.5m is exactly the amount of factored receivables in 2018.

Gaming The Bonus Targets 
(Example: Gross Profit)


CHD management did not call out an inventory accounting change as a 10bp benefit to gross profit in 2018. The timing of the 
change in 2018 is curious, given that headline gross profit contracted 140bps.  Yet, management still exceeded its threshold 


gross profit level for its annual incentive compensation calculation with unexplained adjustments. By our calculation, 
management failed to meet the target threshold by adjusting for the accounting change.

margin and how do I get it?

An Adjustment By Any Other Name….


In our opinion, the “adjusted” gross margin and operating profit margins that CHD represents are demonstrably inaccurate. CHD
pretends that an inventory accounting change that boosted gross margin by $4m should not be “adjusted”.

Gaming The Bonus Targets 
(Example: Diluted EPS)


A more egregious example of management gaming its bonus targets to reap excess compensation is its calculation of 
Diluted EPS. CHD’s acquisition of Agro BioScience started to underperform, and it reversed the earnout liability 


downward, which boosted earnings by $7.5m. Shareholders should be appalled that management (enabled by a sleepy 
Compensation Committee) are reaping bonuses for a failed deal and an accounting change.

Spruce Point Has Even Broader Concerns 
About Bonus Targets


A closer look at key targets used to pay management its annual bonus reveal significant analytical shortfalls in the methodology. 
The Compensation Committee, and shareholders, should demand that Net Sales be adjusted for acquisitions, and Diluted EPS be 


adjusted for share repurchases. Management has not demonstrated it is a disciplined acquirer of businesses, nor should it be 
rewarded for overpaying for its own stock to boost EPS.

Management For 
Repurchasing

Prices


 CHD repurchased $1 billion of stock from 2016 – 2018, including $200m in 2018
 Shares repurchased in 2018 reduced the share count by 4.1m
 We estimate the net benefit from share repurchases was $0.03


• $0.04 of repurchase benefit, less $0.01 of incremental interest that would have been 
earned on the cash, assuming 1% interest on short-term investments


 Repurchases can be an effective strategy for value creation when shares are undervalued, or 
to prevent dilution from exercising of options by employees


 However, CHD’s shares are expensive and trade at a premium to peers. Shares issued to 
employees have been approximately 0.7 – 0.9m per annum, thus buybacks are not merely to 
offset dilution 


 In 2018, acquisitions contributed 5.4% to growth out of 9.8% total (55 %) 
 Management has proven to be poor acquirers, deal-makers, and pay large premiums for targets:


• Recent impairment of Natronx, and earn-out reversals of Passport and Agro Bioscience
 Shareholders should demand management be paid on organic growth and not net sales targets

CEO Farrell CAG NY Conference, Feb 2019:


“In Asia, so it accounts for $90 million of our $200 million export business. What we did a 
year ago was we signed up with a master distributor -- a premier master distributor in 
Southeast Asia called DKSH. It's a Dutch company. We trained 200 of their reps a year 
ago. So great expectations for what we can do in Southeast Asia over -- in the coming 
years. And then what we did this past year was sign up with Shanghai Jahwa. So in 
August, we signed a deal with them. And it took us about 1.5 years to find the right 
partner. And they are a publicly traded consumer products company in China. They have 
expertise both in bricks-and-mortar and online, so they're really suited to help us. So big, 
big ideas, big, big expectations for China in the future.”


CFO Dierker FLAWLESS Call, March 2019:


“This should be in that Tier 4 that hasn't even been implemented yet when anything and 
everything from China could be impacted. So no impact on tariffs right now..”


CEO Farrell CAG NY Conference, Feb 2019:


“So Waterpik has been hit with a 25% tariff. So when we bought that business, it had 
gross margins that were similar to the corporate margins, but with this U.S. tariff, it's 
25% upcharge on everything that comes from China…  For example, SPINBRUSH, which is 
one of our power brands, is a battery-operated toothbrush. It's the #1 battery operated 
toothbrush in the United States. It's sourced from China, a long supply chain. So we're 
used to that. Another one would be TROJAN vibrators. It's also sourced from China and 
it's co-packed. Both Waterpik and FLAWLESS are also co-packs, a long supply chain”

All-Time High Valuation Makes No Sense


EV / NTM Sales Price / NTM EBITDA


As CHD’s core brands suffer, and as it pivots to more aggressive deals where it fails to hit its own targets and spins 
excuses, we fail to explain why CHD’s multiples extend to all time highs.

Relative Valuation


Despite not having the size and scale to compete with larger peers, and known to have historically pursued a copy-cat 
like strategy to mimic products, CHD commands a premium valuation. Investors are sacrificing a lower dividend yield in 
favor of the hope of a couple percentage points of organic growth. We believe CHD’s organic growth is fleeting, and it 


would better serve investors by ceasing further acquisitions and share repurchases to increase its dividend.

Highest Valuation In Sector Unwarranted


EV / 2020E EBITDA


Price / 2019E Operating Cash Flow


Investors ascribe CHD the highest valuation in the consumer products sector, mostly on the misplaced belief that its 
growth is fastest among peers, but fail to account for the low quality contribution from acquisitions, and recent price 


increases that have temporarily boosted revenues.

Ownership Geared Towards 
Retail Investors…


Beyond the top few shareholders, which are mostly passive, there are not a lot of conviction owners of CHD or hedge 
funds. We believe many shares are owned by investment advisers, and up to 10% by retail holders, who have 


historically thought of CHD as a safe and defensive investment run by conservative management. We believe that 
perception needs to change in light of our research and forensic investigation.

Our EBITDA is below Street consensus as a result of the 
following adjustments: 


1) Historical accounting gimmicks missed by the Street and 
used as a basis for future projections (see slide)


2) Normalized JV Consolidation: We adjust CHD’s EBITDA for 
the consolidation of Armand Products


3) We believe 100bps of expansion from “productivity 
programs” will fail to continue. Based on our research, we 
believe CHD is deemphasizing investment in 
manufacturing and supply chain investment in favor of 
acquisitions. We model 25-50bps (see slide)


4) We do not believe the 200 – 300bp margin expansion 
touted by management from the Waterpik deal will come 
to fruition based on recent commentary (see slide)


5) We already see evidence of saturated distribution and 
competition in FLAWLESS. As the Nielson data also shows, 
product life cycles are short. ULTA’s commentary on 
women’s cosmetic products is also an instructive data 
point. We conservatively model its EBITDA eroding from 
30% to 20-25% (see section)


Our report has gone to great lengths to show CHD’s lofty 20x 
EBITDA multiple is underserved for a collection of mostly 
decaying brands. CHD should not trade at a premium to 
stronger peers such as P&G, Colgate and Clorox, which are 
market leaders and price setters. As a result, the high end of 
our price multiple range is 16x, in-line with its higher quality 
peers. The 10 year average 1yr forward EBITDA multiple for 
CHD is 13x, which is the low end of our range. 


We believe the Street has failed to critically assess the accuracy of its financials and achievability of projections offered by
management from recent acquisitions in light of its recent (Agro / Passport) and long-term acquisition failures.  


1.  From the JV’s $100m of sales we eliminate est. sales to CHD of 
$15-$25m, apply a cost mark-up 30-40% and assume 15% 
incremental EBITDA margin on non-related party sales. We eliminate 
$4.7m of management fees from both JV’s that CHD is using to 
reduce SG&A
