Executive Summary
Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), a manufacturer of electric vehicles and solar panels, is 
widely regarded as an American clean energy success story.  Its market capitalization 
has exceeded $80 billion at its peak, and it operates factories in California, Nevada, 


New York and China.  Yet recently released docu-
ments obtained by PlainSite affiliate Think Com-
puter Foundation reveal that the entire company 
is at this point built on a massive, multi-billion dollar 
fraud orchestrated by its CEO, Elon Musk, who for 
years has gone to extreme lengths to conceal his 
unlawful acts from shareholders.  In parallel with 
this core fraud, under Musk’s leadership, Tesla de-
frauded taxpayers in New York and California out 
of more than 1.2 billion dollars, while producing 
products with serious and sometimes fatal quality 
defects that will likely put the company at risk in a 
projected 300 new lawsuits in 2020.


In 2016, Tesla acquired SolarCity Corporation, a company run by Musk’s cousins, Peter 
and Lyndon Rive, for $2.6 billion.  The acquisition, which made no financial sense for 
Tesla, was a bailout for Musk and his relatives, whose companies faced near-certain 
bankruptcy without emergency financing.


Since the merger, Tesla has been a financial disaster.  In its nearly seventeen years of 
existence, the company has never turned an annual profit.  Even with billions of dol-
lars of subsidies from governments worldwide, it has managed to incinerate money 
at an astounding pace.  Despite having the lowest 5-year trailing earnings per share 
growth of any NASDAQ company worth more than $50 billion, it also has the highest 
forward price-to-earnings ratio in the class.  Tesla’s astounding overvaluation is thanks 
in large part to a coterie of devoted followers whose television appearances and 
often fake social media accounts have whipped up a frenzy of hype.  Many have also 
targeted critics and short sellers with vitriol and harassment.  While the company’s 
advocates speak of “moats” that give Tesla a competitive advantage, the truth is that 
Tesla has virtually no protectable intellectual property and it has pledged to open-
source its relatively few patents, besides.  Management is in shambles.  Meanwhile, the 
coming decade is certain to feature new competitors in the electric vehicle space.


Simply put, Tesla cannot be understood through traditional quantitative metrics be-
cause its disclosed numbers are largely fraudulent.  Tesla is a broken company, ef-
fectively a Ponzi scheme, founded upon the enthusiasm of brilliant hobbyists who 
unknowingly partnered with a self-described narcissistic “bait and switch[er].”  Today, 
Tesla’s story is Musk’s story.  And that story is much different than the PR narrative.

Corporate History


The Early Days


Tesla Motors, Inc. was incor-
porated on July 1, 2003 in 
Delaware and Septem-
ber 2, 2003 in California by 
co-founders Martin Eberhard 
and Marc Tarpenning.  Eberhard and 


Tarpenning had created a prototype 
electric sports vehicle called the tzero with the engineering expertise 
of AC Propulsion, a niche auto shop in Los Angeles run by Alan Coc-
coni, who had developed drivetrain electronic components for the 
General Motors EV1.1


By October 23, 2003, news of the AC Propulsion tzero had reached 
Harold Rosen, the brother of Compaq’s Chairman, Ben Rosen.2  In 
a bizarre transaction that speaks to the frenzied nature of the dot-
com bubble, staid hardware manufacturer Compaq had purchased 
South African entrepreneur Elon Musk’s first company,3 Zip2, for $307 
million in February 1999.4,5  Compaq had already acquired Digital 
Equipment Corporation about a year prior for $9.6 billion, and the 
AltaVista search engine, which had originated in Digital’s Network 
Systems Laboratory and Western Research Laboratory to show off 
DEC’s 64-bit Alpha microprocessors, was part of the package deal.  In 
theory, Compaq hoped to enhance AltaVista with Zip2’s technology, 
which internet users today would think of as a combination of Yelp 
and Google Maps.  Practically speaking, it made flipping AltaVista even 
more lucrative for Compaq: ten months after the Zip2 acquisition, 
Compaq offloaded 83% of AltaVista, Zip2 and the forgotten website

3 According to the California Secretary of State, Zip2 Corporation began as Global Link Information Network, Inc. on 
November 3, 1995—months after Elon Musk claims he “deferred” his enrollment in a Stanford University Ph.D. program 
after two days to work on his internet business instead.  As reported by Ashlee Vance in Appendix I of his biography 
Elon Musk: Tesla, SpaceX, and the Quest for a Fantastic Future, according to a June 22, 2009 document sent to Musk from 
the Stanford University Office of the Registrar, Musk never actually enrolled.  As recently as December 28, 2019, Musk 
claimed to have bootstrapped his way through “Queens Univ with scholarship & debt, then same to UPenn/Wharton 
& Stanford,” but Vance also reports that, “Errol Musk gave his sons $28,000 to help them through” as they got started in 
Palo Alto.

Ten months after that, CMGI had lost 80% of its 
value.7  Today, despite those stratospheric valua-
tions, Digital, Compaq, AltaVista, Zip2, and CMGI 
have all long since ceased to exist.


Aside from being Ben Rosen’s brother, Harold 
Rosen happened to be the boss of a talented en-
gineer named JB Straubel.  Straubel e-mailed Elon 
Musk to discuss electronic aircraft and cars, and 
over lunch, in Musk’s words, “They told me about a 
company called AC Propulsion that had developed 
an all electric sports car called the tzero with a 
range of 300 miles, a 0 to 60 mph time of under 4 
seconds and a lithium ion battery pack with seven 
thousand cells.”  When Musk asked, AC Propulsion 


wasn’t interested in commercializing its vehicle, but it knew who might 
be: their partners at Tesla Motors.  Eberhard e-mailed Musk himself 
on March 31, 2004 seeking investment, having previously met him at 
Stanford Mars Society conference in 2001.8


After earning two bachelor’s degrees from the University of Penn-
sylvania9, Musk had applied to and been accepted by a Stanford Uni-
versity Ph.D. program, but he never formally enrolled.  Thanks to that 
decision, his father’s financial support, and the eventual sale to Com-
paq, Musk had gone from nearly broke to incredibly wealthy overnight.  
He found even more incredible dot-com luck when five months after 
founding X.com in November 1999 as an on-line bank, the company 
merged with Peter Thiel’s, Max Levchin’s and Luke Nosek’s Confin-
ity, best known for its product designed to beam money between 
PalmPilots using their infrared ports, called PayPal.  Musk was the CEO 
for six months, after which he was ousted in a coup and replaced by 
Thiel.10  Years later, for extending credit to customers who had abso-


lutely no creditworthiness, Thiel would describe Musk as, “The man who knew noth-
ing about risk.”11

ics and a B.S. in economics (concentrations: finance and entrepreneurial management) from the University of Pennsylva-
nia.  The degrees were awarded on May 19, 1997.”  Musk attributes the two-year delay to a missing credit.

reliability problems and was loyal to the X.com brand over “PayPal.”

This description of Elon Musk explains almost every sub-
sequent event in his career, where raw ambition mixed 
with a healthy dose of condescending hubris—masked by 
humor but reinforced by dot-com bubble financial suc-
cess—consistently served as Musk’s guiding force, no mat-
ter the risk involved.  As an avid science fiction reader, he 
already had plenty of ideas about what the future should 
look like, and the billions of dollars that had showered 
down upon him and others thanks to Alan Greenspan’s 
easy monetary policy12 gave him no reason to doubt his 
own decision-making abilities, or the notion that hard work 
always paid eight- to nine-figure dividends in short order.


Consequently, when Musk met Martin Eberhard to discuss 
electric cars, one of his lifelong interests, Musk agreed to in-
vest $6.35 million after some cursory questions about the 
feasibility of manufacturing.  Eberhard remained CEO.  (JB 
Straubel joined soon after.)  The company’s initial product, 
the Roadster sports coupe, was arguably the first mass-
market electric car to use lithium-ion battery cells.  With 
a required deposit of $100,000 for early models, it was 
targeted at wealthy enthusiasts in California who could af-
ford the luxury of spending more than many people earn 
in a year to experiment with what was perceived to be 
the next big thing in clean energy.  As documented in Ed-
ward W. Niedermeyer’s book Ludicrous: The Unvarnished 
Story of Tesla Motors, the fledgling Tesla Motors was not at 
all prepared for the serious challenges of producing an ac-
tual car, and worked closely with Lotus Cars in the United 
Kingdom to achieve its previously unthinkable goals.  Even 
with Lotus’s engineering assistance, the notion that the 
Roadster would ever be profitable was a pipe dream.13  


Lotus’s parts had to be modified by hand when they arrived in the United States, and 
the Roadster was plagued by quality problems, causing its celebrity owners, such as 
George Clooney, to ask why they were always stranded on the side of the road in 
their fancy electric car.


Undeterred as usual, in an August 2, 2006 blog post, Elon Musk outlined his “master 
plan”: an affordable, mass-market vehicle that required no gasoline whatsoever, built 
using the money earned from selling a sports car (the Roadster) and a slightly more

Tesla’s original logo, designed at Musk’s request by the 
designers of the SpaceX logo, sought to emulate those 
frequently used by other automobile manufacturers.  
Neither the logo nor the name “Tesla Motors” reflect-
ed any plans for the company’s foray into other parts 
of the energy sector, such as batteries and solar panels.

affordable mass-market car (the Model S and Model X).14  The 
first trick would be actually building any car, at scale, for a profit.  
The second trick would be convincing the world that the plan 
was working, even if none of the cars in the first two steps were 
generating any consistent profit at all.


Accordingly, the company pinned its hopes on Whitestar, a code 
name for what came to be known as the Model S: a mid-size 
sedan that looked similar to a Toyota Camry.  With Tesla’s em-
ployee roster growing and technical challenges multiplying, com-
pany management was increasingly at odds with one another.  
Musk’s attention-seeking nature began consuming Tesla’s limited 
human resources.  Eventually, there was a falling out between 
Eberhard and Musk, and on May 26, 2009, Eberhard sued Musk 
in San Mateo County Superior Court for libel, slander, breach 
of contract, conversion, negligence, and a host of other claims, 
including the incorrect presumption that Musk had lied about 
having graduated from Penn.15  The lawsuit ultimately settled, 
with Musk contractually permitted to refer to himself as a “co-
founder” of the company according to the settlement terms.  
Eberhard had effectively been pushed out.


Securing Funding From Uncle Sam


In order to survive as a company, Eberhard and Tarpenning turned to two sources of 
income: customer deposits (hoping to finance their cars in the same manner as air-
planes) and the federal government.  On Tesla’s behalf, Musk lied to customers early 
on, telling them via e-mail, “the Department of Energy informed Tesla last week that 
they expect to disburse funds from our $350M loan application within four to five 
months,” referring to a loan application submitted to the United States Department 
of Energy that had not actually been approved.  Per a Freedom of Information Act 
(FOIA) request by Edward W. Niedermeyer, “[Tesla’s] December 2, 2008, application 
had been rejected due to insufficient data to verify efficiency claims and environmen-
tal regulation compliance.  Tesla’s successful application to the loan program wouldn’t 
be filed until May 4, 2009, months after Musk’s claim about imminent disbursement.”16


After years of development, in the burgeoning world of electric cars, the Model S 
was a major success.  Though hardly cheap, it was far less expensive than the Road-
ster—essentially the only electric car that a well-to-do middle class family in Palo Alto

or Mountain View, California might actually consider buying to help save the environ-
ment.  Consequently, the Model S was the best-selling plug-in electric car in 2015 
and 2016.  Yet it was still not successful enough to make Tesla Motors profitable on 
an ongoing basis.  By the end of 2016, Tesla’s retained earnings totaled negative three 
billion dollars.


Using the Model S platform, the company’s next car was the Model X, which Tesla 
started producing in 2015: a modernized, electric homage to the 1980s silver DMC 
DeLorean featured in the Back To The Future series of films.  While its falcon-wing 
doors made it somewhat popular, it too was not profitable enough to swing Tesla 
consistently into the black.  But Musk’s apparent fascination with John DeLorean, a 
charismatic former General Motors executive who sought to build a new American 
car company and ended up arrested on drug charges,17 would prove intriguing.


Perceived Market Advantages


The Charismatic Leader


Tesla’s greatest asset is its first major investor, Elon Musk.  Musk is a household name 
from the United States to South Africa to China to Japan, whose reputation for be-
ing a freewheeling, science-driven innovator precedes him wherever he goes.  In turn, 
Musk’s greatest asset is his sense of humor, which he deploys frequently to deflect 
criticism and endear fans, many of whom view him as a demigod who can do no 
wrong.  As of the writing of this report, Musk boasts 30 million followers on the Twit-
ter social network.  Of those 30 million, Musk most often interacts with roughly a 
dozen accounts, giving the illusion that he is accessible to just about anyone.


Next-Generation Technology


Tesla has been undeniably ahead of other car companies in deploying technologies 
that are taken for granted in Silicon Valley, but which are less frequently associated 
with Detroit.  Tesla’s vehicles are equipped with wireless internet connectivity for 
downloading “over-the-air” software updates that can enhance the car’s features, 
Bluetooth-enabled locks, and a sophisticated touchscreen-based entertainment con-
sole that makes BMW’s iDrive knobs and arrows look about as modern as a cassette 
deck.  The company’s image recognition software, commonly referred to as employing 
“artificial intelligence,” can handle basic object recognition and lane centering in many 
cases, and does not use Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) sensors, lowering the 
expense of deployment.

6Reality Check


The Model 3


The Tesla Model 3 is the first ever mass-market 
electric vehicle that is affordable on a middle-class 
family budget, with a base price near $35,000.  
With an austere, touchscreen-based interior that 
appeals to a generation accustomed to iPads, the 
Model 3 is considerably more popular than any 
other electric vehicle on the market at present, 
and has received generally positive reviews for 
its safety features.  The Model 3 also shares many 
of its components with the forthcoming Model Y, 
which makes manufacturing easier.


Battery Production


Under Musk’s leadership, Tesla has invested heavily in battery production for its own 
cars via a partnership with Panasonic in order to reduce the price per unit.  High bat-
tery costs present a significant challenge to delivering an affordable electric vehicle 
for every automaker.  By agreeing to purchase an enormous volume of batteries from 
Panasonic in advance and by building a dedicated plant in Storey County, Nevada 
(near Reno), Tesla has been able to leapfrog its competition, which is only now start-
ing to catch up. 


Global Footprint


Although it is based in the United States, Tesla now has a car factory in China, as well 
as plans to build a factory in a suburb of Berlin in Germany.  Once up and running, 
its distributed global manufacturing operations will give Tesla the ability to produce 
cars more cheaply than it otherwise could, while saving on substantial shipping costs.  
China is also a potentially large market for the sale of electric vehicles, and Tesla ap-
pears to have the backing of the government there.


Unrecognized Risks


A History of Deliberate Deception for Personal Gain


In Ludicrous, Niedermeyer documents the fact that Elon Musk’s history of fraudulent 
behavior dates back to at least as early as 2009, when Tesla was struggling to survive 
as it sold the Roadster electric sports car to its wealthy, early-adopter customers.  
Since then, Musk’s burgeoning empire has grown far more complex, as have the lies.

Elon’s Pyramid


Elon Musk is known for being the CEO or Chairman of three major companies that 
combined into two after the 2016 SolarCity deal: Space Exploration Technologies 
Corporation, or SpaceX for short; Tesla, Inc., formerly known as Tesla Motors, Inc.; and 
SolarCity Corporation.


In an April 27, 2016 Wall Street Journal article, Musk revealed that the 
intertwined nature of his enterprises is as much a vulnerability as it is 
an advantage when he was quoted as stating that it is “important that 
there not be some sort of house of cards that crumbles if one ele-
ment of the pyramid of Tesla, SolarCity and SpaceX falters.”18  Another 
key entity not mentioned was the Elon Musk Revocable Trust Dated 
July 22, 2003, which owns a majority stake in SpaceX.


The “pyramid” analogy sets the stage for the balancing act that Musk 
has attempted to master since the early 2000s.  Each company on 
its own aspired toward an audacious goal: dramatically reducing the 
expense and complexity of space travel (and colonizing Mars) for 
SpaceX; making electric vehicles fun and affordable for Tesla; and en-
abling a long-overdue shift to renewable energy for SolarCity.  On 
the surface, raw ambition aside, these goals are laudable, and with the 


possible exception of colonizing Mars, involve a clear societal benefit.  But the devil, 
as is often said, is in the details.


The truth is that to fully describe Elon Musk’s financial arrangements, a pyramid 
(whether its base is triangular or square) hardly has enough sides.  Musk is associated

In the Vernon Unsworth v. Elon Musk federal court case concerning Musk’s alleged 
libel of a British cave diver who assisted with the rescue of boys trapped in a cave in 
Thailand, it was revealed that Musk’s “family office” limited liability company is called 
Excession, LLC.20,21  Excession is also a 1997 science fiction novel by Iain M. Banks.  This 
complex proliferation of shell companies, managed by a former wealth management 
advisor named Jared Birchall from a law firm office in Burlingame, California, has given 
Musk a convenient way to plausibly deny that any of his companies has ever paid for 
or been connected to any kind of suspicious or untoward activity.  To pin down what 
Musk has been up to, one must learn to play his shell game.

The SolarCity Bailout


SolarCity was founded in 2006 by Lyndon and Peter Rive, Elon Musk’s cousins.  Musk 
himself was the Chairman of the Board of Directors, having reportedly provided the 
initial impetus to start the company by suggesting that there might be opportunities 
in the clean energy space.  By that point, Musk had been an investor in Tesla Motors 
for three years, and had been leading SpaceX for four.


To keep the companies afloat, and because on rare occasion it may have actually 
made sense, Tesla, SolarCity and SpaceX sometimes engaged in undisclosed related-
party transactions, such as SolarCity buying cars from Tesla, or SpaceX purchasing so-
lar panels from SolarCity.  These transactions were alluded to but not fully described 
by Tesla Directors during depositions.  In the words of former Tesla Director Brad 
Buss, “We would just—you know, we might buy solar panels for something.  They may 
be buying batteries and stuff from our perspective.  You know, I think they bought 
some cars.”22  But by 2015, these cozy transactions were not enough to make up for 
what was fundamentally a failing business for SolarCity.


SolarCity’s business model was more 
complex than simply earning cash to install 
or manufacture solar panels.  Instead, the 
company leased its solar panels to custom-
ers, who would pay for them in monthly 
installments.  The revenue streams from 
the leases were then securitized, allowing 
third-party investors to buy up the oppor-
tunity to profit from financing America’s 
transition to “green energy.”


SolarCity was not the only company em-
ploying this “solar-as-a-service” model.23  It 
was, however, one of the largest players.  
With names like SolarCity LMC Series V, 


LLC, Series 2016-1 and SolarCity FTE Series 2, LLC, Series 2017-A, the company 
securitized tens of thousands of solar panel arrays installed on homes and businesses 
across the United States.  Unfortunately, by 2016, these securitization vehicles were 
starting to run into serious financial trouble.


To make matters more complex, by 2016 SolarCity had disclosed 212 subsidiary 
companies to the SEC—mostly headquartered in Delaware, but also in Mexico, Aus-

SolarCity LMC Series IV, LLC - Historical DSCR


DSCR DSCR/Insurance Sweep* Early Amortization Class B Interest Deferral


An August 2019 Kroll ABS surveillance report for SolarCity LMC Series IV, 
LLC, Series 2015-1 showed that SolarCity is still in rocky terrain, having just  
missed an early amortization trigger level in January.  SolarCity’s successor 
began suing a number of Arizona customers for non-payment later in 2019.

tralia, the Cayman Islands, and Hong Kong.24  One of those subsidiaries, Megalodon 
Solar, LLC, was involved in a 2015 loan agreement referred to as the “Kronor Facility,” 
which would later become key to SolarCity’s fate.25


By 2016, SolarCity’s CEO, Lyndon Rive, was starting to panic.  The company required 
a bridge loan to avoid defaulting on its revolving debt, and no one was willing to pro-
vide it.26  The cousins had strategized a buyout over a conversation at Lyndon Rive’s 
second home at Lake Tahoe in February 2016.27  He attempted to tell his cousin and 
Board Chairman, Musk, how dire the situation was, but Musk seemed distracted by 
other issues.  When discussing whether SolarCity should raise equity by May 2016, 
Musk asked, “Can it wait a month?”28  Any buyout would need to be approved by 
shareholders, and given the horrific financials and the conflicts of interest between 
the Board members, that was going to be tricky.


For Elon Musk, failure was not an option.  Because SpaceX owned 77% of SolarCity’s 
bonds, a SolarCity bankruptcy would potentially have catastrophic consequences for 
SpaceX, and in turn, the Elon Musk Revocable Trust.  The damage to his reputation 
alone could spell serious trouble for cash-strapped Tesla, as well, causing a cascade 
of events that could plausibly lead to Musk’s personal bankruptcy and long-term 
alienation from banks and capital markets.  He was therefore motivated to take 


extreme—even illegal—measures to prevent such 
an occurrence from taking place.


Musk schemed with his cousins and both Boards 
of Directors to make it appear as though his plan 
for a vertically integrated energy company was 
widely supported and had made perfect sense 
all along.  In reality, the Tesla, SolarCity, and even 
SpaceX Boards were all against the deal.  Tesla 
stood to acquire a massive amount of debt from 
SolarCity, and there was little realistic overlap be-
tween manufacturing, selling and financing solar 
panels and manufacturing and selling cars.


That the deal made absolutely no sense was 
widely known.  As Linette Lopez wrote in Busi-
ness Insider, “[T]he merger that Musk called a ‘no-

Here, a majority of the Tesla Board received personal benefits because they 


owned SolarCity stock.  The Acquisition diluted Tesla stockholders who did not also 


own SolarCity stock.  Elon Musk, Kimbal Musk, Gracias, Jurvetson, and Buss were 


able to offset that dilutive effect by virtue of their substantial holdings in SolarCity: 


Defendant SolarCity Shares Value in Tesla Conversion44 
Elon Musk45 22,162,870 $451,063,162.81 
Kimbal Musk46 147,541 $3,002,783.94

Steve Jurvetson48 1,672,381 $34,036,632.59 
Brad Buss49 37,277 $758,668.96 


 
Defendants do not dispute these facts.  Instead, Defendants argue that these 


benefits did not pose a conflict of interest because of their high “net worth.”50  


However, there is no exception to directors’ “uncompromising duty of loyalty”51 that 


would permit directors to pursue self-interested transactions so long as they are 


independently wealthy.

brainer’ appeared to be anything 
but.  No other company was bid-
ding to buy SolarCity, and accord-
ing to internal emails, it was also 
struggling to find financing for a 
$200 million bridge loan that it 
needed immediately.”29  In the 
words of Lyndon Rive recorded 
in an e-mail about one of Solar-
City’s loan agreements (and then 
redacted), “If we breach [K]ronor, 
we’re dead.”30


According to Tesla’s own General 
Counsel at the time, Todd Maron, 
the deal was worse than nonsensi-
cal: it would actually harm Tesla.  As 
he wrote,


“[T. Rowe Price] said what Tesla is trying to accomplish in the automotive space is 
very complex and to add SolarCity to the mix raises the operational and financial risk 
profile of the company, especially given SolarCity’s financial challenges as a company.” 


Advisors Evercore Partners LLC and Lazard also insisted that the deal was prob-
lematic, even looking at numbers that painted an overly optimistic picture due to 
an enormous mathematical error.  Everywhere Musk turned with proposals to save 
SolarCity, he heard a loud “no.”  Both Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley refused to 
lend money on the basis that SolarCity had failed credit checks.  Even the Board of 
SpaceX—a company controlled by Musk—“said no” to investing, according to newly 
unredacted testimony by SolarCity CEO Lyndon Rive.  Other than Elon Musk, the 
number of parties formally interested in rescuing SolarCity was precisely zero.  But he 
couldn’t pull off a deal entirely on his own.


The Tesla Board finally cracked under pressure from Musk.  Virtually all of the Direc-
tors could only be described as obviously and hopelessly conflicted.  Kimbal Musk—
who somehow managed to claim under oath that he didn’t perceive any conflict at 
all31—was Elon’s brother and business partner dating back to his Zip2 days.  Steve 
Jurvetson and/or his funds owned 1.67 million shares of SolarCity stock.32  Ira Eh-

renpreis was invested in SpaceX through a secret Special Purpose Vehicle—the only 
one of his firm’s investments that apparently necessitated an SPV.33  But old-fashioned 
nepotism alone still wasn’t enough to push the deal through.


Never one to back down, and 
completely ignoring the fact that 
his plan would violate numerous 
federal and state laws, Musk de-
vised a solution to save himself: a 
fake product demonstration.  He 
would announce and launch a 
“Solar Roof Tile,” proving that the 
supposed vertical integration be-
tween SolarCity and Tesla had al-
ways been meant to be.  On Oc-
tober 26, 2016, the demonstration 
took place on the set of the televi-
sion show Desperate Housewives, 
carefully orchestrated to keep the 
star-struck press corps from catch-
ing onto the fact that the entire 
presentation was a hoax.34  The 
product didn’t work, didn’t really 
exist, and it wasn’t hooked up to 
the electric grid.  It was all for show 
to induce shareholders to approve 
a multi-billion dollar securities 
transaction that would save Musk 
and his family members from likely 
bankruptcy.  And it worked.


When Tesla and SolarCity share-
holders voted on the merger deal, they were falsely told that Elon Musk had been 
“recused” from the decision making process—a massive lie.  Court documents reveal 
that Musk guided the process at every step along the way, even as every other party 
saw the clear danger in what he proposed.35  Investors were not told, however, that 
SolarCity was at risk of breaching key loan covenants, that it had been rejected by at 
least two major investment banks for credit, that the Board had been informed about 
cash concerns for months, that every financial advisor asked had advised against the

deal, or that SolarCity solar panels might be using defective components that ideally 
would need to be recalled to avoid fire risk.  Despite lacking this crucial information 
and trying to keep it sealed, confidential, and redacted in court throughout 2019 and 
early 2020, Tesla’s Board still maintains that shareholders were fully informed.


However one characterizes them, shareholders blindly followed their leader and 
voted to approve the deal.  Musk got exactly what he wanted, managing to convince 
people he was a “visionary” as a bonus.  And Tesla got saddled with billions of dol-
lars of SolarCity’s looming debt.  The lesson of the SolarCity merger, only partially 
revealed three years after it completed, could be summarized as follows: far from the 
reserved, quirky engineer he once was, Elon Musk would do anything to get ahead—
including committing criminal acts and trying to cover them up.


In deposition testimony regarding the merger in June 2019, Elon Musk repeatedly as-
serted that while “we certainly believed that the long-term growth of megawatts de-
ployed would be very significant,” he had also needed to re-allocate all of SolarCity’s 
resources, including staff, to Model 3 production, or else Tesla’s very survival would 
have been in jeopardy.  In Musk’s words, 


“It takes time to refactor a product line.  It takes time to restructure a company.  And 
our focus last year was the Model 3 program.  And so Tesla as a whole, if I did not 
take everyone off of solar and focus them on the Model 3 program to the detriment 
of solar, then Tesla would have gone bankrupt.  So I took everyone from solar, and said, 


‘Instead of working on solar, you need to work 
on the Model 3 program.’”36


But this strange ex post facto rationaliza-
tion—that unless Tesla acquired SolarCity 
for its labor pool, Tesla would go out of 
business—completely contradicts what 
investors were told at the time in 2016.  
Nor does this line of reasoning appear in 
discovery materials from 2016, or line up 
with any other person’s recollection of the 
discussions leading up to the deal.  It also 
strains belief that SolarCity shareholders 
would have willingly agreed to sacrifice 
their company for the good of another 
corporation that was already on life sup-
port.  At no point did Tesla disclose that 


it would require thousands of additional employees to make the Model 3 program 
work, let alone that the only way to hire them would be to acquire a company whose

SolarCity/Tesla Megawatts Deployed

staff had no experience whatsoever with vehicle manufacturing or sales.  Effectively, 
Musk argued under oath that SolarCity was doomed to fail no matter what: if Tesla 
had not purchased SolarCity, then it would have been forced to declare bankruptcy, 
but because Tesla did, since Tesla was already on the verge of bankruptcy itself, Solar-
City was stripped of its assets and left to rot, as was supposedly the plan all along.  Yet 
somehow, despite the complete and deliberate decimation of the business, Musk still 
believed “the long-term growth of megawatts deployed would be very significant.”


The striking inherent contradictions in this line of reasoning make it sound like Musk 
was lying under oath.  Either way, the results of Musk’s resource shift are visible in 
the numbers.  SolarCity was reduced to a shadow of its former self after the merger, 
negating any ex post facto justification regarding “synergies” or “vertical integration.”  
Given the amount of legal hassle its long-term lease agreements continued to gen-
erate for Tesla—which found itself embroiled in land trespass lawsuits,37 mortgage 
cases, and foreclosure litigation galore, not to mention the expense of handling So-
larCity’s various Asset-Backed Securities and 200+ subsidiaries—it is a near certainty 
that keeping the solar business alive for the sake of appearances cost Tesla far more 
money than it was actually worth.


Securities Fraud, False Statements and Unfulfilled Promises


Tesla’s market valuation is considerably higher than many of its competitors, despite 
its failure to even once sustain a profit for a full year.  Some of the stock’s buoyancy 
can be attributed to Elon Musk’s star power, but beyond that, it is crucial to recognize 
that Musk and the company are constantly making false promises to customers and 
investors—many of them provably false—in an effort to (unlawfully) boost the stock 
price.  This is possibly because Elon Musk’s compensation package—a scheme called 
“extraordinary” by the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance—is 
entirely composed of stock options potentially worth billions of dollars, depending 
upon the share price.38  Since the United States Securities and Exchange Commission 
(SEC) has largely been missing in action, these efforts to manipulate markets have, 
for the most part, worked, leaving 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5—the 
bedrock of American securities law—almost completely unenforced.


“Funding Secured”


Many people who had not been following Tesla’s stock learned of it for the first time 
from an incident in August 2018 that is still today the single most egregious instance 
of securities fraud in the history of the stock market.  At 9:48 A.M. on Tuesday, August

This was a lie.  Funding to take Tesla private was not se-
cured, and never had been.  The tweet would set in motion 
a series of events as markets and regulators attempted to 
grapple with the implications.  Three days later, lawyers 
filed the first of fourteen resulting lawsuits in federal court 
and three in state courts.39  Most of the cases were ulti-
mately consolidated into one, which remains ongoing after 
a year-long detour to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals 
to resolve the question of who should serve as lead plain-


tiff: those with losses from both long and short positions, or those with the greatest 
losses overall from short selling Tesla when it skyrocketed on Musk’s fake news.40


Two of the federal suits were filed by the United States Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which despite a general hands-off policy thanks to the Trump Adminis-
tration’s laissez-faire, pro-crime approach to financial regulation, still felt pressure to 
do something.  Unable to reach an agreement with Musk and Tesla, the SEC took both 
cases to court in the Southern District of New York.  In short order, Musk settled, with 
both Musk and Tesla agreeing to pay $20 million fines each, Musk agreeing to step 
down as Chairman of Tesla’s Board of Directors, new requirements for independent 
directors imposed by the Commission, and pre-approval of Musk’s tweets required 
going forward.


The “funding secured” incident was a landmark event in the 
history of financial markets for a number of reasons.  For 
those who previously hadn’t paid much attention to Elon 
Musk, it put him on the radar in a shocking and unflattering 
manner, attracting even more short interest in Tesla’s stock.  
It also demonstrated how social media could be used to 
manipulate financial markets in an instant, while regula-
tors scrambled to keep up.  The settlement also showed 
executives a new low in what could be gotten away with. 


Practically speaking, the settlement made little difference 
to Musk, who clearly felt emboldened.  On December 9, 
2018, Musk appeared on CBS News’s flagship program, 60 
Minutes, stating, “I want to be clear.  I do not respect the 
SEC.  I do not respect them,” directly into the camera.  He 
also openly admitted that he had been violating the SEC’s 


binding Consent Decree.41  From that point forward, he was confident that he could

by no one despite the 2018 SEC Consent Decree, re-
sulted in charges of contempt of court.  Ultimately,

say or do anything he wanted to with zero repercussions.  And he did.


On February 19, 2019 at 4:15 P.M., Musk posted new guidance on his Twitter account: 
Tesla would manufacture 500,000 cars in 2019.  Four and a half hours later, he at-
tempted to walk it back, but it was too late.  The SEC finally dragged Musk back to 
court in April 2019 to subject him to contempt proceedings.  But Musk still didn’t 
need to worry.  The SEC’s trial lawyer, Cheryl Crumpton, made such a poor showing 
that Judge Alison Nathan chalked up Musk’s deliberate and inexcusable antics to a 
mere misunderstanding.  Sounding more like a kindergarten teacher coaching par-


ents of feuding children than a federal judge, she 
stated, “My call to action is for everyone to take 
a deep breath, put your reasonableness pants on 
and work this out.”  Musk promptly walked out of 
the courtroom and declared victory.  Two months 
later, the SEC attorney he had been negotiating 
with left the SEC to work for Tesla’s lobbying part-
ner.  Despite highly questionable circumstances 
surrounding the amended Consent Decree that 
the SEC finally ironed out, Judge Nathan never 
bothered to follow up.


October 24, 2018 Q3 2018 Earnings Call


During the regulated earnings call on October 
24, 2018, Musk claimed, “This quarter, we started 
rolling out Version 9.0 of our software which is 
the biggest software upgrade in three years.  And 
Model 3 received a 5-Star safety rating in every 
category and subcategory.  And it got less prob-

ment has ever tested.”42  In fact, according to what

Tesla Worker Rights Cases Filed Over Time


Tesla has faced an increasing number of lawsuits, many of them class-action suits, alleging unsafe and racist working conditions at Tesla’s 
factories across the United States.  There have also been several lawsuits alleging pervasive sexual harassment.

informing him that it had referred Tesla to the FTC Bureau of 
Consumer Protection.

does not distinguish safety performance beyond the star rating with five stars being 
the highest safety rating a vehicle can achieve.  Thus, there is no NHTSA ‘safest’ rank-
ing within the five-star category.”43  By the time of the call, Musk had also received a 
letter addressed directly to him from NHTSA expressing exasperation that Tesla had 
repeatedly “failed to comply with the terms of [NHTSA] Guidelines.”  His false claims 
had led NHTSA to refer Tesla to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC)—a fact that 
Tesla did not ever disclose to shareholders.  Instead, the letter was obtained by Think 
Computer Foundation via a FOIA request.


Musk and Laurie Shelby, Tesla Vice President, EHS, also made statements on the call 
regarding the manner in which Tesla provides healthcare for employees who work at 
its Fremont, California factory:


“...We’ve also just opened a new and improved health clinic, so when injuries do occur 
we get the absolute best care for our associates.  And it’s actually overseen by one of 
California’s leading orthopedic surgeons.  And we did that, because most of our injuries, 
like we said like 80%, 85% are those sprains and strains.  So now they get that best 
care here on site.  And we have 24/7 care.  We are actually staffed by three full-time 
doctors and nurses.  And I am really super happy with the care they’re giving, and I 
think the employees are as well.”


These comments were likely in response to investigative reporting by Reveal reporter 
Will Evans, who starting in April 2018 took the company to task in a series of detailed 
articles and radio programs for its dismal track record taking care of injured employ-
ees, including some who suffered serious burns.  Not mentioned by Ms. Shelby was 
the fact that Dr. Muhannad Hafi, one of the doctors hired by Tesla’s medical contrac-
tor, Access Omnicare (merely a DBA name for a hand surgeon named Dr. Basil Besh), 
was facing revocation of his medical license at the time he was hired.  His license was 
formally revoked by the California State Medical Board on December 21, 2018 for 
having sexually assaulted numerous prior patients.44  Another doctor whose name 
appears on Access Omnicare medical records provided to Reveal worked for Access 
Omnicare for all of one week.


Therefore, Musk’s statement that Tesla’s medical care was “the absolute best” could 
not possibly be true, as no objective observer would consider an unlicensed sex of-
fender and a physician absent after one week to be “the absolute best” health care 
providers available.  Musk went on to refer to Access Omnicare as “a really immedi-
ate first-class healthcare available right on the spot, when people need it.  And this is 
not just for workplace, this is for workplace and non-workplace.”  Reveal’s reporting 
suggests that this too was a lie.  In fact, Tesla was sending employees to the hospital

in Lyft vehicles to avoid having to report injury statistics or pay for ambulance trips.45  
Despite these efforts to prevent negative metrics from ever surfacing, Tesla’s injury 
rates still ballooned out of control.46  With no sense of irony, Laurie Shelby described 
Tesla’s care practices as “super exciting” on the call.  Musk went even further, stating, “if 
you like become injured right off for any reason then there is healthcare immediately 
on site.”  In fact, Tesla’s on-site medical facilities were and are quite limited, requiring 
frequent transportation to actual health care facilities.


Investors listening to these false statements might have been reassured that Tesla 
had its workplace injury program under control.  In reality, it was fined by CalOSHA 
numerous times for violations, and its practices have led to no fewer than 80 employ-
ment-related lawsuits.47


January 30, 2019 Q4 2018 Earnings Call


By January 30, 2019, Musk knew or should have known that the pace of Model 3 sales 
was drastically slower in January than it had been during Q4 2018.  On December 31, 
2018, a federal tax incentive for electric vehicle purchases began to phase out, erod-
ing a significant incentive for potential customers to purchase Tesla vehicles.  Despite 
the knowledge that sales had slowed markedly, Musk still assured investors on the 
earnings call that future demand looked strong.  On the call, with 30 days of sales data 
at his disposal, he nonetheless stated, “I’m optimistic about being profitable in Q1 and 
all quarters going forward.”


Three months later, Tesla announced a $702 million loss, which would have ap-
proached $1 billion had the company not factored in one-time sales of emissions 
credits—a far cry from profitability.


April 24, 2019 Q1 2019 Earnings Call


On Tesla’s Q1 2019 earnings call, Musk declared, “We expect to return to profitability 
in Q3 and significantly reduce our loss in Q2,” once again reversing his previous pre-
diction of a profit made only weeks prior.  Yet again, Musk likely knew this statement 
to be false at the time he made it, but sought to increase Tesla’s declining stock price.


Musk also made the compound false statement, “All Tesla class vehicles today have all 
the hardware necessary for full self-driving and over-the-air updates will enable our 
customers to use the Tesla ride-hailing network fleet and generate income, which as 
we said on Autonomy Day a few days ago we think is somewhere between $10,000 
and $30,000 a year, in some cases, perhaps more.”  He also made the outrageous

claim that, “…in 2020, we expect to have a million robotaxis on the road with the 
hardware necessary for full self-driving.”  Tesla vehicles do not have the hardware 
necessary for full self-driving, because even in the year 2020, there is no such thing.


Misleading Vehicle Pricing


Tesla’s website, where customers can configure their vehicles for purchase, has long 
used a misleading pricing calculator to suggest that its cars cost less than they actually 
do.  Effectively, Tesla has pioneered the deceptive advertising method of selectively 
including theoretical future savings in the final price of a product, even when the 
actual outlay of funds by the customer is far higher than the number presented.  For 
example, if a Model 3 actually costs $40,000 up-front but could potentially lead to 
$3,000 in savings on gasoline in the future, Tesla would advertise the car as costing 
$37,000 in the present.  Of course, this ignores other, less convenient future realities, 
such as the fact that using more electricity to power the car at home, or at a charg-
ing station, might drastically increase a customer’s utility charges, or that some homes 
do not have the electrical wiring needed to safely charge a vehicle, necessitating the 
expense of hiring a contractor.48  It also ignores a reality that has given numerous Tesla 
customers sticker shock: the fact that insuring Tesla vehicles is extremely expensive 
relative to non-Tesla vehicles.


No other company in the United States has ever been permitted to use this kind of 
pricing model, whether for car sales or other products, which is illegal on its face given 
that it is intended to deceive.


The Chinese Customs Debacle


On March 5, 2019, the Chinese English-language publication Caixin published an ar-
ticle with the headline “China is currently holding 1,600 Teslas at customs,”49 setting 
off a plunge in Tesla’s stock price.  This news was picked up by Reuters and syndicated 
to other financial news websites such as CNBC (which later deleted the article).50


Later on March 5th, Reuters published a second article announcing that the issue 
in China had been resolved, immediately lifting Tesla’s stock.51  The Reuters article 
was based on a single source “familiar with the matter,” who convinced Reuters that 
“China’s customs authorities have accepted electric carmaker Tesla Inc’s plan to rem-
edy problems.”  An initial version of the article suggested that the source was a Tesla

This representation, that a “plan” from Tesla had 
been “accepted” by the Chinese government, 
proved to be false.  In fact, the issue with Chi-
nese customs remained unresolved for weeks, 
contrary to what Reuters had reported on its 
wire service.  Tesla had failed to include labels 
for the cars printed in the correct language for 
the Chinese market, and the actual number of 
vehicles affected was much higher than previ-
ously reported: over 4,600.  On March 14th, 
Bloomberg published a much more detailed 
article explaining that China had finally cleared 
Tesla vehicles to proceed through customs.52


If in fact Tesla deliberately provided false and/
or misleading information to the press, a ma-
terial and significant violation of 15 U.S.C. § 


78j(b) and 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5 took place.


Rooftop “Money Printers”


On three occasions, either the @Tesla or @ElonMusk Twitter accounts have referred 
to Tesla solar panels as “money printers,” presumably in reference to the expected 
savings on energy bills post-installation.53,54,55  Unfortunately, for many actual custom-
ers, their solar installations have been anything but.  Several lawsuits have been filed 
against SolarCity and Tesla alleging that solar installations actually made utility bills 
increase thanks to a proliferation of hidden fees.56


Phrases such as “money printer” are not subtle: they deliberately convey the sense 
of a risk-free product that will instantly result in profit for the owner.  Given the 
complexity of solar financing arrangements, such a description is reckless and false, 
and likely violates the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) Act, as well as related state 
consumer protection statutes.


The money printer tweets also raise the question of who actually controls and has ac-
cess to the @Tesla Twitter account, and if that person is ever Elon Musk.  If so, the SEC 
Consent Decree from September 2018 (and the amended version thereafter) would

presumably be binding upon Musk, whether he chooses to post from his personal 
account, the @Tesla account, or any other social media account.  While the amend-
ments to the Consent Decree limited the types of posts that require pre-approval, 
Musk hardly has a free pass to break the law by posting false and misleading state-
ments.  The characterization of Tesla products as “money printers” could conceivably 
violate the Securities and Exchange Act as well as the Consent Decree itself, which 
explicitly requires Musk to abide by the law.  Furthermore, the question of who, if 
anyone, approved these tweets remains open.  Tesla has never identified the so-called 
“Twitter Sitter” tasked with overseeing Musk’s external communications.


Elon Musk has taken to referring to Tesla solar panels as 
“money printers” in order to lure consumers.  This phrasing 
is false, deceptive, and unlawful under the FTC Act and nu-
merous state consumer protection statutes.  Yet despite nu-
merous lawsuits over Tesla’s solar business, no government 
agency has taken action so far.


In Kolibas v. SolarCity Corporation, filed in November 2019 in the Supe-
rior Court of Middlesex County, New Jersey, the plaintiffs accused Tesla of 
charging hidden fees and ruining their roof.  As SolarCity’s acquiror, Tesla has 
incurred significant legal liability due to roof damage from solar panel weight, 
fire, and snow.

Vehicles as “Appreciating Assets”


Cars depreciate in value as soon as 
they are driven off the dealer lot.57  
Some depreciate more than oth-
ers, but this phenomenon is com-
monly known to apply to all cars, 
of all makes and models, since time 
immemorial.  At some point well 
past a car’s typical lifespan, scarcity 
may lead to appreciation in value 
for certain antique or collector’s 
edition cars, but this is relatively 
rare.


On April 12, 2019, in an inter-
view broadcast on YouTube with 
a self-described machine learning 
expert, Musk stated, “Buying a car 
today is an investment into the fu-


ture.  I think the most profound thing is that if you buy a Tesla today, I believe you are 
buying an appreciating asset—not a depreciating asset.”58  Musk is not claiming that 
Teslas will be valuable antiques: quite the opposite.  He is asserting that their moder-
nity will make them worth more later on.  This might be true if production of all cars 
in the future were to suddenly cease—an extraordinarily unlikely possibility that is not 
Musk’s implication in any way—but otherwise it is a clear lie.


Musk’s outrageous claim has its roots in the fact that because Tesla vehicles are ca-
pable of receiving wireless software updates, they will supposedly appreciate in value 
over time because Tesla can always make the car better.59  Three months after he first 
proposed the theory, in July, Musk doubled down on the claim, with Bloomberg News 
running the headline, “Musk Stands by His Tesla Appreciation Claim That Was Called 
‘Really Dumb.’”60


Perhaps the individual best positioned to disprove this nonsensical claim is Musk him-
self.  In August 2018, in a video interview posted to YouTube,61 Musk acknowledged 
the obvious fact that advances in technology lead to lower, not higher, prices.  In his 
words, “[W]e’re probably, I don’t know, on the thirtieth version of, of, of a cell phone.

Even before Elon Musk started fraudulently touting Tesla’s solar panels as “money print-
ers,” customers alleged in legal filings that the panels actually make their monthly utility 
bills higher, not lower, and come with hidden fees.  Above, an excerpt from the complaint 
in Garcia et al v. SolarCity Corp. et al, Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo, 
Case No. 18CIV03640.

Or, um, and...  And with each successive 
design iteration, uh, you can add more ca-
pability, you can design—you can integrate 
more things.  You can figure out, uh, bet-
ter ways to produce it, so it actually gets 
better and cheaper.  But, it’s like, a natural 
progression of any new technology” (em-
phasis added).


Musk’s remarks are clearly self-contradic-
tory.  The key question is why within the 
span of eight months he changed his po-
sition on a basic economic principle for 


which there is ample evidence that Tesla vehicles do not appreciate, and never have.  
It goes without saying that making such false promises would be consistent with ef-
forts to stimulate demand in the short term in order to satisfy Wall Street expecta-
tions and boost Tesla’s stock price.


Notably, Tesla customers have reported that Tesla itself believes that its vehicles de-
preciate, even if the CEO suddenly does not.  In the words of one customer,


“I contacted Tesla for a trade in value. Tesla quoted 15% below the average Kelly blue 
book value and 36% below the original MSRP.  When I was purchasing the Tesla, they 
taught-ed that depreciation at 50k miles was roughly 28% and was number one in 
the industry, well that ship has sailed since the launch of the Model [3].  It is evident 
that due to the Model 3 the value on the Model S is evaporating on a monthly basis.  
The Model 3 is going to continue to crush the value of Model S and I would anticipate 
a sharp drop in MSRP, probably in the neighborhood of $15k to $20k, especially con-
sidering the tax break is about to be reduced”62


It is unclear why regulators have allowed Musk to continue to claim that Tesla vehicles 
appreciate in value while Tesla itself continues to recognize depreciation when its own 
cars are traded in by repeat customers.


Autopilot


Tesla’s hallmark software feature, at least as of early 2020, is the so-called Autopilot 
functionality that in certain, limited situations allows the car’s camera sensors to guide 
its speed and steering with minimal driver input.  Of course, the name “Autopilot” 
implies more, suggesting that the car is capable of driving itself.  It isn’t.  The fine print 
in the Tesla owner manual instructs drivers to always keep their hands on the wheel.  
It’s a directive that is almost universally disregarded.

23 Tesla, Inc.


It’s not just the company’s customers who feel 
comfortable risking their lives and the lives of 
others on the roads and highways they drive 
on.  During a 60 Minutes interview with Les-
lie Stahl, Musk infamously drove Stahl and a 
cameraman in a Tesla vehicle on U.S. Interstate 
101-N, using Autopilot with his hands clearly 
off the wheel, in what might have been the 
most reckless bit of technology showmanship 
ever broadcast.  The stunt led to an internet 
meme poking fun at Tesla’s Autopilot claims, in-
volving Musk, a pair of maracas, and a colorful 
sombrero.63


Some Autopilot customers have engaged in 
predictable abuse of the technology to work 
around the limited warning chimes and auto-
matic shut-off features that Tesla has built in.  
Photographs abound on Twitter of car owners 
using water bottles, fruit, and other small items 
to trick the vehicle hardware into thinking that 
hands are on the steering wheel.  It goes with-
out saying that this is insanely dangerous, com-
pletely reckless, and likely illegal. 


Aside from Tesla’s outright lies about the tech-
nology (starting with its name), simply due to 
the nature of what it is designed to do, Autopi-
lot is deceptive in the sense that it appears to 
the casual observer to be more capable than 
it really is, until it suddenly isn’t.  The danger 
lies in these so-called “corner cases,” as they 
are referred to in the world of software devel-
opment—untested situations where Autopilot 
suddenly, and without warning, fails—because 
while corner cases for many computer pro-
grams might only result in a window disap-
pearing from a screen, a crash on an interstate 
at 65 miles per hour can easily result in the 
loss of life.64  That has already begun to happen

when Autopilot has been involved.


To date, Tesla has been sued at least 20 times in cases 
involving Autopilot.65  Many of those lawsuits have in-
volved accidents where fatalities were directly caused 
by the driver’s reliance on Autopilot—the tragic 
and predictable consequence of the technology be-
ing released without sufficiently testing.66  Separate 
from litigation, an anonymously-run website called 
tesladeaths.com has begun to track the number of 
deaths linked to Tesla vehicles.67


Concern is warranted.  In Mountain View, not far from 
Tesla’s headquarters, an Apple engineer named Wei 
Lun “Walter” Huang died when his Tesla Model X col-
lided head-on with a concrete divider separating the 
highway from a ramp for an elevated express lane on 
CA 85-S.  Huang’s Model X was set to use Autopilot 
at the time of the crash, and the software had fol-
lowed what it believed was a lane marker painted on 
the highway directly into the barrier without slowing 
down at all.  In fact, before he was killed, Huang had 
noticed Autopilot’s tendency to deviate from the cor-
rect path at that spot, and had brought it to Tesla’s at-
tention repeatedly.  After his death, his family sued; the 
lawsuit is ongoing.68


A response to a Freedom of Information Act request 
by Think Computer Foundation revealed that the Na-
tional Highway Transit Safety Administration (NHTSA) 
regularly subpoenas Tesla for information regarding 
collisions that involve Autopilot.69  Tesla and NHTSA 
have also held regularly scheduled meetings to discuss 
Tesla’s self-driving technology, and to provide in-per-
son demonstrations for federal regulators.


65 PlainSite.  https://www.plainsite.org/tags/tesla-autopilot/
66 Tesla tests many of its cars on a short loop near its Palo Alto headquarters that extends from Page Mill Road to Inter-


state 280-S, Sand Hill Road, and back again on El Camino Real.  On an average day, the weather conditions on this loop 
are considerably more pleasant than, for example, typical winter conditions in Boston, Massachusetts.  This is perhaps 
why many Model 3 owners in colder climates were surprised to find that the “innovative” Model 3 door handles had a 
propensity to freeze shut, locking them out of their cars, often in unforgiving weather.


67 Since Autopilot is deactivated as soon as the driver presses the brake pedal, and it’s common to press on the brakes just 
before a collision, it is possible that the number of Autopilot-related accidents has been under-reported.

69 PlainSite, August 6, 2019, “Tesla NHTSA FOIA Response.” 
https://www.plainsite.org/documents/fnrhg/tesla-nhtsa-foia-response/


A Think Computer Foundation FOIA request response re-
vealed that NHTSA reguarly subpoenas Tesla, Inc. for infor-
maton regarding crashes involving Autopilot.  What NHTSA 
actually does with the information it obtains is unclear.
25 Tesla, Inc.


An appeal of NHTSA’s FOIA response, at-
tempting to wrangle the release of over 400 
pages of documents that NHTSA had with-
held, yielded a few more pages, but with re-
dactions in key places.70  For example, Tesla 
insisted that the version of its software vehi-
cles were running when they were involved in 
Autopilot-related accidents was a trade secret, 
even though this information is crucial to de-
termining whether a flaw in a particular ver-
sion of Tesla’s software may have been at least 
partially responsible.  Several court cases have 
addressed a related problem involving the fact 
that after a collision, Tesla retains ownership of 
the vehicle’s data, making it nearly impossible 
for drivers, passengers, or affected victims to 
figure out what went wrong without issuing 
a subpoena to Tesla for their own car’s data 
first.71


Incredibly, Tesla’s form letter in response to 
those who threaten legal claims due to Auto-
pilot includes the warning that, “To the extent 
your client intends to pursue a product claim 
against Tesla, we reserve the right to claim the 
physical evidence from the vehicle has been 
spoilated if it is not being preserved in its post-
incident condition.”  In other words, Tesla ex-


pects victims of its design flaws to keep severely damaged vehicles in storage indefi-
nitely while it withholds the digital evidence necessary to move forward with a case.  
Then again, considering that Elon Musk reportedly hung up on the Chairman of the 
National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Robert Sumwalt, during a probe into a 
Tesla crash, this is hardly surprising.72


On December 18, 2019, European Union regulators forced Tesla to disable key por-
tions of Autopilot across Europe, causing the company to notify customers in multiple 
languages that they would no longer be able to use features that they had already 
paid for (in some cases thousands of Euros extra).73  Meanwhile, there is evidence

On August 7, 2019, Elon Musk wrote to the author of this report stat-

by a significant margin.  It is unethical and false of you to claim other-
wise.  In doing so, you are endangering the public.”  Above, the result of 
Tesla’s request to NHTSA that all information concerning an Autopilot 
collision be redacted as “Confidential Business Information”—one of 
many such requests by Tesla, all granted.

that NHTSA has actively tried to cover up devastating statistics on Tesla’s behalf.  A 
FOIA lawsuit lodged by Quality Control Systems Corporation74 forced NHTSA to 
divulge documents indicating that “actual mileage at the time the Autosteer software 
was installed appears to have been reported for fewer than half the vehicles NHTSA 
studied.  For those vehicles that do have apparently exact measurements of exposure 
mileage both before and after the software’s installation, the change in crash rates as-
sociated with Autosteer is the opposite of that claimed by NHTSA.”75  In other words, 
by using flawed data analysis, NHTSA whitewashed the fact that Autopilot actually 
makes driving more dangerous.


As of the end of 2019, despite obvious warning signs and an outcry from public 
watchdog groups and even Senator Markey of Massachusetts, Autopilot was still caus-


ing crashes on American roads.76


Full Self-Driving (FSD)


While Autopilot might fairly be described as a 
driver assistance technology, Elon Musk is not the 
kind of person who would merely be satisfied with 
“driver assistance,” even assuming that such assis-
tance worked in 100% of scenarios and wasn’t 
already responsible for numerous driver deaths, 
injuries, and millions of dollars in property damage 
and health care expenditures.  To stay ahead of the 
competition, Musk has additionally promised “Full 
Self Driving” at Level 5 on the Society of Automo-
tive Engineers scale by 202077—a technology that 
does not exist at present.78  Musk has not hesi-
tated to conflate the two technologies.


To be clear, Tesla vehicles equipped with the com-
pany’s “Autopilot” feature cannot, in fact, drive 
themselves.  Nor has Tesla achieved anything close 


to Level 5 autonomy now that 2019 has drawn to a close, despite Musk’s promises 
to the contrary.79

27 Tesla, Inc.


On April 22, 2019, Tesla held an “Autonomy Investor Day” where Musk and several 
engineers demonstrated the company’s progress on software and hardware in the 
domain of autonomous driving.  The audience of uniformly Tesla-friendly investment 
analysts, mostly lacking the computer science background necessary to understand 
what they were being told, managed not to ask too many probing questions.  But 
even with an audience of faithful cheerleaders, there were a few hitches.


First, a demonstration video of how Tesla’s autonomous driving software works re-
vealed that it appeared incapable of distinguishing between traffic on one side of a 
highway versus the other side, where cars were traveling in the opposite direction, 
even when separated by a wide median.


Second, Tesla’s software could not at the time recognize construction markers, such 
as large orange reflective barrels.  A video posted to YouTube months later on July 15, 
2019 by a Tesla owner showed how his vehicle plowed head-on into ten orange bar-
rels in a row before he took control and stopped the car.80  Finally, in early December 
2019, years after Tesla began deploying Autopilot while marketing it as safe—and long 
after Elon Musk’s promises that Level 5 autonomy was merely months away—Tesla 
added in recognition for orange barrels.  Except that didn’t quite work, either.


On December 16, 2019, a news story began cir-
culating about a boy wearing an orange shirt in 
Brazil who had been mistaken for a cone by Tes-
la’s software.81  While the boy was not hurt, the 
story continued to raise serious questions about 
Autopilot’s true abilities, the safety concerns as-
sociated with using it, and the veracity of Musk’s 
claims about FSD technology being just around 
the corner.


The abuse of language by Tesla and Musk has been 
so shocking that consumer watchdog group Consumer Reports issued a press re-
lease immediately after Tesla’s Autonomy Investor Day entitled, “Consumer Reports: 
Tesla Must Prove Safety Before Claiming ‘Self-Driving’ Ability.”82,83

ward the end, the vehicle almost swerves into a stationary school bus parked outside an elementary school—but thanks 


Tesla’s “fix” for the orange barrel problem caused a new problem: 
the recognition of children wearing orange shirts as traffic cones.
28Reality Check


Musk has ignored these worrisome signs, instead pressuring his staff to work faster.  
That pressure has had consequences, with mass departures from the Autopilot team 
within Tesla making headlines in July 2019.84  The pressure was particularly acute on 
the team because of Musk’s habit of making grandiose-yet-maybe-possible, baseless-
yet-aggressive public pronouncements.  For example, on March 24, 2017, Musk wrote 
on Twitter, “All Tesla cars built since Oct last year will be capable of self-driving as 
software improves.”85  Musk repeated this claim on April 22, 2019 by stating on Twit-
ter, “All cars made since Oct 2016 either have the hardware needed for FSD or are 
trivially upgradeable.”86


Since then, numerous customers have grown upset over promises that their vehicles 
would be upgraded to “Hardware 3.0,” which Musk has claimed is necessary for 
FSD capabilities.  Yet no one seems to be able to get their hands on Hardware 3.0, 
whatever it is, and accordingly, pre-paid upgrade fees for FSD functionality, typically 
ranging from $5,000 to $6,000, have thus far paid for nothing save for an engorged 
“Customer deposits” line item on Tesla’s balance sheet.


That Musk would even be focused on far-afield, risky gambits when it comes to pas-
senger safety is remarkable given data from Norway showing that electric vehicles 
are already more dangerous on average than internal combustion engine vehicles.  In 
2018, 9% of internal combustion vehicles in Norway suffered some kind of accident 
damage, while the rate was 13.5% for electric vehicles overall.  But for Teslas, that 
figure was the highest in the country: 20.4%.  In other words, more than one in five 
Tesla vehicles in Norway was involved in an accident in 2018.87  The main feature that 
separates Teslas from other electric vehicles is assisted autonomous driving.


Robotaxis


Still not content with the fanciful notion that Tesla would achieve Level 5 autonomy 
by year-end 2019, Musk decided to make an even bolder, more audacious prediction: 
that by 2020 Tesla would deploy a “fleet” of one million self-driving “robotaxis”—es-
sentially, the same cars that customers had already purchased and put on the road, 
but with software updated wirelessly to turn these vehicles into autonomous self-
driving taxis for commercial, as opposed to personal, use.  The notion, seemingly 
targeted at Wall Street analysts in an over-extended bull market hungry for hype, was 
that in addition to its revenue streams from selling cars and solar panels, Tesla would 
also soon compete with sharing economy heavyweights Uber and Lyft.


Some media outlets have called the idea questionable.88  Truly, it can only be fairly 
to driver intervention, does not—even with the bus’s lights flashing.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c6YMY2m7GKI

described as bonkers.


When questioned about how the com-
pany reached its conclusions at Autonomy 
Investor Day, Musk responded, “We just 
randomly threw some numbers on there.”  
That sounds about right: Tesla, Uber, and 
Lyft are all fundamentally unprofitable 
companies, with Uber losing over $5 bil-
lion in the single quarter of Q2 2019.  Why 
any CEO would want to emulate such a 
business is an open question subject to de-
bate.  But for Elon Musk to both have that 


desire, and to condition it upon the provably false promise of deploying a technology 
that does not exist, suggests some actual motive for making the claim other than 
sheer delusion.  Keeping Telsa’s stock price up is one possible motive.


Strangely, no reference to robotaxis ultimately appeared in the company’s secondary 
offering prospectus in early 2019.  Like Tesla’s securities lawyers, experts at MIT also 
doubt that such a service would be cost effective.89  On the other hand, it’s still pos-
sible that Silicon Valley startups (as well as Valley-based divisions of large automotive 
manufacturers) will pilot autonomous taxi services in the near future.  Computer vi-
sion engineer Anton Troynikov wrote about how such a competitive landscape might 
unfold in March 2018.90  As of January 2020, no services have launched thus far.


“Unusually High [Order] Volume”


On March 19, 2019, the official @Tesla Twitter account claimed, “Due to unusually 
high volume, Tesla was unable to process all orders by midnight on Monday, so the 
slight price rise on vehicles is postponed to midnight Wednesday.”91  (This post was 
also re-tweeted by Musk’s personal @ElonMusk account.)  There was no evidence 
for this suspicious claim at the time, and the company’s Q1 2019 financial report 
confirmed it to be a two-part lie: Tesla’s servers were fine, and there was no spike in 
order activity that caused them to experience any problems.


Fundamentally, Tesla’s rosy narrative about being a “growth” company, still believed by 
much of Wall Street, is misleading given that its sales have plateaued or decreased 
in the United States since 2018.  Data from New York State, which publishes VIN-
level information monthly, indicates that new registration of Tesla vehicles just barely

peaked in September 2019, scraping by levels from December 2018.  The company’s 
efforts to meet quarterly delivery targets have historically brought demand forward 
at the end of each quarter, causing significant drop-offs in the following month.


Selective and Misleading Pre-Order and Reservation Disclosures


For a time, Musk was pleased to boast about the number of reservations for the 
Model 3, each of which involved a deposit.  By April 24, 2019, on the Q1 2019 Tesla 
earnings call, his attitude had completely shifted and he stopped disclosing anything 
about reservations, claiming that they no longer mattered.  In Musk’s words,


“I think we don’t want to comment on the granularity of deposits.  Again, people read 
too much into this.  We’re not playing off the Model Y because we’re just not in produc-
tion so you can’t really read anything into Model Y orders at this point.”


His mind changed again when it came to the Cybertruck, a product whose launch 
turned into a spectacle when Musk launched a steel ball at not one, but two win-
dows, breaking both.92  Musk broadcast the number of Cybertruck reservations on 
his Twitter account almost immediately, posting one number after another despite 


92 A video Musk posted of the backstage prep for the launch revealed why the truck’s windows broke.  In practice runs, 
the car doors were left slightly ajar and covered by padding, making it difficult to see that they had room to give when 
the ball hit each window.  On stage, the doors were firmly shut.  The sledgehammer used to “prove” the toughness of 
the truck appeared to be a dead blow hammer, designed to minimize direct striking force.  The hammer was rotated 90º 
when used to strike the competing truck, maximizing its effectiveness.  In other words, the demonstration was a sham.

Tesla, Inc. New York Vehicle Registrations (Excluding Renewals)


Model 3 Model S Model X Roadster


Data compiled from New York State vehicle registrations as of January 3, 2020 demonstrates that Tesla’s growth in one of its key states has 
plateaued, and sales may in fact be falling.  The periodic wedge pattern is consistent with big end-of-quarter sales pushes in March, June, 
September and December.  As of December 31, 2019, federal electric vehicle tax credits are no longer available to Tesla buyers.

widespread reports of depositors com-
plaining about multiple, unintended pre-
orders and payment card charges.


Musk clearly uses transparency to his ad-
vantage, preaching the value of openness 
when it is convenient and secrecy when it 
is not.  He is hardly the only Silicon Valley 
CEO to do so.  This is exactly why regula-
tors such as the SEC and FTC should take 
a close look at regulations that require 
companies to disclose key metrics on a 
consistent basis, since otherwise investors 


are left in the dark when transparency is needed most.


A Tale of Two Morgan Stanleys


Morgan Stanley sell-side analyst Adam Jonas covers a number of companies in the 
automotive industry, including Ferrari, Ford, General Motors, Hertz, and Tesla.  Like 
many sell-side analysts, he publishes periodic “research” that summarizes the bank’s 
views on a company’s prospects, and he also speaks with institutional investors about 
risk factors that might affect relevant investments.


Even armed with the knowledge that sell-side analysts such as Jonas are, on average, 
“useless,”93 many investors were nonetheless surprised to learn that the story Jonas 
has been telling publicly about Tesla was considerably different than the one he whis-
pered in private.  Specifically, in May 2019, a conference call recording of Jonas speak-
ing to favored Morgan Stanley clients leaked out.94,95  In the call, Jonas told his clients 
that Tesla had transformed “from a growth story to a distress credit and restructuring 
story.”  He further argued, consistent with his public March 2019 report, that demand 
for Tesla’s products was lacking.  On the matter of Tesla’s debt, Jonas stated, “No one 
really cares about debt.  No one cares about the [credit default swaps] as long as 
you’re growing.  When questions are called into your growth these numbers start to 
be noticed.”


A few days after the call leak, the market largely forgot that it had ever happened.  
Morgan Stanley never amended its public disclosures to reflect the direct sentiments 
expressed by Jonas on the call.  Instead, in December 2019, Jonas expanded his target 
range from $10 to $500,96 calling the stock, “fundamentally overvalued, but potentially

strategically undervalued.”97  This kind of 
squishy, ridiculous nonsense would hardly 
pass for analysis in any graduate-level sta-
tistics course, but on Wall Street, it’s in-
credibly common.  As observed by Law-
rence Fossi,


“It never fails.  It’s like the swallows returning 
to Capistrano.  The analysts whose collective 
‘analysis’ is factored into the consensus fig-
ure, must each year reduce what begins as 
a profitable future earnings forecast until the 
forecast finally converges with reality, which is 
negative.”98


Jonas is one of those very analysts with the 
curious trait of cyclical optimism who has 
had to repeatedly temper his expectations 
for Tesla’s earnings per share.  In March 
2019, Jonas lowered his EPS estimate from 
$4.17 to $1.30.99  And he’d done it before: 
“Jonas cut his 2016 EPS estimate from 
$1.28 to $0.43.”100  And before that: “Jo-
nas lowered his 2015 earnings per share 
estimate for Tesla to $2.45 from $4.39.”101  
In baseball, the rule is “three strikes and 
you’re out.”  Even these reduced estimates 
always proved far too optimistic.  But un-


like baseball teams, sell-side investment banking analysts appear to never lose.


Other False Statements


Whether it has been Tesla speaking for Musk, or Musk speaking for Tesla, the com-
pany has literally issued too many false statements to count.  In September 2018, 
Tesla posted a public update based on an “internal” e-mail message to employees.102

Unit volume. We cut 1Q19 Model 3 deliveries by 23% to 48k units, which


we believe may be modestly below consensus to allow for sluggish US


sales and potential impediments to international deliveries. Our FY19 total


company volume of 362k units is at the low end of the company’s 360k to


400k range.


ATPs. We’ve reduced M3 average transaction prices by between $1k to


$2k/unit vs. our prior forecasts… settling out near $53k by 4Q19. We’ve cut


Model S and X prices by 3% to 4% on average this year to reflect recent

Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas issued a price target of $260.00 for 
Tesla’s stock on March 12, 2019, approximately two months before he told 
select investors that he believed Tesla was destined for “restructuring,” i.e. 
bankruptcy.  Morgan Stanley was also one of the underwriters on Tesla’s $2.5 
billion May 2019 raise.
33 Tesla, Inc.


Referring to Q3 2018, this update claimed that, “We are about to have the most 
amazing quarter in our history, building and delivering more than twice as many cars 
as we did last quarter.”  This proved to be false: according to Bloomberg News, Tesla 
produced 28,578 Model 3 vehicles in Q2 2018, and 53,239 Model 3 vehicles in Q3 
2018.103  Twice the Q2 2018 production figure would have been 57,156 vehicles, or 
7.35% more than were actually produced.  The post also made unsubstantiated claims 
about the electric vehicle battery market share of Tesla’s Nevada-based factory.  Then, 
on December 26, 2018, Musk wrote on Twitter, “Brake pads on a Tesla literally never 
need to be replaced for lifetime of the car.”104  That’s simply not true; Tesla’s own user 
manual states, “Neglecting to replace worn brake pads damages the braking system 
and can result in a braking hazard.”105


But Elon Musk’s most outrageous lie ever came on a November 12, 2019 podcast 
with alternative media personality Lex Fridman in which Musk commented on his 
vague idea for a brain-implantable microchip, Neuralink.  Musk stated, “Neuralink, I 
think, will at first solve a lot of brain-related diseases.”106


Taken alone, this immensely arrogant, ignorant claim is totally senseless.  Musk then 
went on to actually specify, “So, uh, could be like anything from autism, schizophrenia, 
memory loss, like everyone experiences memory loss at certain points in age...  So, 
there’s a tremendous amount of good that Neuralink can do in solving critical—criti-
cal damage to brain or the spinal cord...”  Presumably, these baseless, false statements 
were not run past the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) before 
being made in public.


To be clear, Elon Musk does not have a medical degree or background, and so far, 
Neuralink is a non-peer reviewed, non-FDA approved, non-human tested, science 
fiction-based, deeply uninformed idea of what medical treatment should look like 
for those suffering from neurological diseases.  Musk is so obsessed with his own 
mythology, in fact, that he demanded that his name be the only one listed on the 
solitary paper Neuralink has published.107  While measuring brain activity can be use-
ful—and is already done using a variety of FDA-approved medical devices—there is 
zero chance that Musk’s whimsical, evidence-free notions about how the brain works 
could provide any useful treatment for “autism, schizophrenia, [or] memory loss,” ever.  
Neuralink would also carry enormous risk of surgical complications, including infec-
tion.  Musk’s statements are completely false and misleading,108 likely to be misinter-
preted by many patients or families in desperate straits, and should be fully retracted if

Families of individuals suffering from mental illness are routinely buffeted with news of 
hoax cures and hoax risks.  Here, Musk has added fuel to the fire of medical misinfor-
mation.  Investors should be concerned about placing their trust in a chief executive 
willing to say absolutely anything, no matter how false or dangerous, just to prop up 
his own frail ego.


Product Defects


VIN Mismatch Issues


There have been numerous reports of Tesla manufacturing 
vehicles where Vehicle Identification Numbers (VINs) are 
mismatched on different parts or missing altogether.  This is 
shocking, because for most major vehicle manufacturers it 
simply does not happen.  In the world of auto manufacturing, 
the VIN is somewhat sacrosanct: all sorts of quality control, 
legal, insurance and sales processes depend upon it being cor-
rect.  Tesla’s factories, for whatever reason, have had repeated 
difficulty getting VINs right.109,110  Given the seriousness of the 
problem, Tesla’s response to an inquiry by The Drive was rather 
understated: “A mistake was made.”  Some owners have also 
reported finding blank VIN plates on their vehicles.


Fires


Worldwide, a number of Tesla vehicles have spontaneously 
caught fire, including numerous cases in the United States.111  


Sadly, in some cases, vehicle fires have led to deaths, as Tesla failed to design a door 
locking system that would always make it possible to unlock doors from the inside 
in the event of an emergency.112,113  In the United Kingdom, an entire Tesla dealer-
ship ignited.114  Other Tesla vehicle fires have been reported in Shanghai, California,

Florida, New Hampshire, and Nevada, where an entire car carrier ignited.115  In April 
2019, Linette Lopez of Business Insider reported that she had “counted at least 20 
reported incidents of Teslas catching on fire since 2013 and five deaths in the past 14 
months.”116


Electric vehicle fires present unique challenges for firefighters because of the way 
that lithium (the main element present in lithium-ion batteries) reacts with water. by 
producing hydrogen gas and lithium hydroxide in a rapid single displacement reaction.  
Hydrogen is extremely flammable.  Consequently, putting out a lithium fire can take 
hours on end, after which the fire sometimes re-ignites hours later.  For this reason, 
some fire departments have begun to use enormous water tanks to hold and sub-
merge entire electric vehicles in water once they are damaged.


On November 1, 2019, NHTSA announced that it would launch a formal investiga-
tion of Tesla battery fires after an attorney for the plaintiff in a related lawsuit filed 
a formal complaint.117  David Rasmussen sued Tesla on August 7, 2019 over Tesla’s 
response to the fire problem: a wireless software update that reduced battery per-
formance across the board for its cars, regardless of what had been advertised to 
customers at the time of purchase.  The suit is ongoing.118


Tesla has also had highly publicized problems with its solar panels catching fire.  On 
August 20, 2019, Walmart, Inc. sued Tesla in the Supreme Court of the State of New 
York for New York County over several solar panel arrays installed on Walmart stores 
that had spontaneously erupted into flames.  The lawsuit was a major news story, and 
Tesla went to great lengths to placate its customer once the suit was filed.  It was 
settled soon after on November 4, 2019, but not before images from the lawsuit 
made their way into the mainstream press.119  In addition, SolarCity and Tesla have 
been sued several times by homeowners who have faced massive repair bills after 
their solar panels or associated equipment caught on fire. 


It should be noted that internal combustion engine vehicles also catch fire on a regu-
lar basis, though rarely without cause (such as when sitting parked in a parking lot) as 
some Teslas have.  NHTSA studied the issue in 2017 and found a comparable fire risk 
between electric and traditional vehicles.120

Project Titan


Internally, Tesla was aware that its solar panels posed a fire risk due to defective com-
ponents manufactured by Amphenol Corporation.  Rather than inform its custom-
ers—many of whom had placed these panels above the bedrooms where they and 
their children slept—Tesla decided to undertake a stealth recall and repair program it 
referred to as “Project Titan.”  Strangely, this is the same name that Apple had given its 
self-driving car program internally, which was surely not lost on management at Tesla.  
The name may have been deliberately chosen to avoid search results pointing back 
to Tesla if its existence were leaked to the press.  Project Titan’s status is unknown.


Vehicle Quality Problems


As described by Edward W. Niedermeyer in Ludicrous, by May 2010, Tesla had defied 
long odds to emerge as a company with a real path forward to long-term profitability.  
It had managed to convince major, established players in the automotive industry to 
invest; it had announced the Model S, even if doing so required a bit of stage magic; 
and it had acquired the old New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI) plant 
in Fremont, California from Toyota at the bargain price of $42 million.  It seemed as 
though things could finally proceed smoothly from there.


Almost a decade later, Tesla is 
plagued by persistent quality prob-
lems, even after the company has 
assured customers and the media 
repeatedly that it has everything 
under control.  Each stage of grief 
has yielded a pronouncement 
from Elon Musk regarding a differ-
ent kind of “hell.”  Musk is expert 
at evoking pity for his lamentable 
role as CEO of a multi-billion dol-
lar company, and has accordingly 
complained bitterly of “production 
hell,” “delivery logistics hell,”121 and 
at one point, “traffic hell.”122


For much of this, Musk has no one 
to blame but himself.  His overly 
aggressive production targets led 


to the questionable decision to build a tent spanning approximately 920 feet in the 
parking lot of Tesla’s Fremont factory to house an extra production line for the Model

3, ultimately referred to as General Assembly line 4, or GA4.  The GA4 
tent solution to Tesla’s problem of overpromising quickly caused new 
problems of its own.  As CNBC journalist Lora Kolodny reported, em-
ployees working in the tent could not produce cars of the same quality 
as the ones built in the factory proper.  They sometimes skipped steps or 
failed to properly torque bolts to keep the line moving, and would often 
resort to using electrical tape to cover for errors.123  In November 2018, 
the tent also exposed the employees themselves to the elements at a 
time when California wildfires north of the San Francisco Bay Area made 
merely breathing the outside air a health hazard.124


Overall, the Model 3 has suffered from numerous defects, including a pro-
pensity for rear bumpers to fall off in the rain; trunks to grow mold due 
to poor insulation; soft undercarriage materials to droop, inadvertently 
turning into snow and mud plows; and center consoles to reboot seem-
ingly at random.  In addition, the Fremont factory’s paint shop has never 
quite managed to achieve the type of quality customers expect, yielding 
thousands of cars with sub-standard, thin paint coats that are more likely 
to erode away or peel simply due to normal wear and tear.125,126  Cus-


tomers also frequently complain of creaking sounds at high speeds, missing bolts, and 
problems with the Bluetooth audio system.127


Some of these problems are attributable to Tesla’s relative youth in the industry, but 
others can be traced directly to decisions made by Musk.  The Model X, with its sen-
sor-laden falcon-wing doors, has attracted more litigation than any other Tesla model.  
One lawsuit128 involving an allegedly defective Model X listed problems starting with 
(a) and ending with (uu), for a total of 47 reported “issues,” and 70 “incidents.”129  It 
is hardly the only one.


As of late 2019, according to litigation records compiled by PlainSite, Tesla had been 
sued over issues involving the Model X 93 times; involving the Model S, 89 times; and 
involving the relatively newer Model 3, 35 times.  It is likely that these rough tallies 
underestimate the amount of litigation, however, because many court documents 
could not be easily obtained.  These figures also do not include arbitration disputes

itoring the company, the complaint looked familiar.131  
Referred to as “whompy wheels” by on-line critics, the 
problem had been reported for years in connection 
with suspensions snapping due to weak metal alloys.  
Photographs132 and video footage appear to confirm 
the existence of a problem.


On November 14, 2019, the Model 3 lost its endorse-
ment from Consumer Reports because of the numer-
ous defects associated with the vehicle.133  According 
to Consumer Reports, “reliability has been a weak 
spot for Tesla.”


Sudden Unintended Acceleration


More times than one might expect, Tesla vehicles have 
been profiled on local news stations nationwide on 
account of their tendency to drive into buildings at 
full speed.  This phenomenon has been given the self-
explanatory name Sudden Unintended Acceleration, 
or SUA, and it is the subject of at least 12 lawsuits and 
122 formal complaints to NHTSA.134


Like Autopilot defects and some software bugs in gen-
eral, SUA is a difficult problem to pin down because 
the vehicle appears to work properly until it suddenly

does not.  The frequency of complaints, however, 
suggests that the problem is real, and not merely a 
case of one or two drivers pressing the accelera-
tor when they meant to press the brake.


In addition to the steadily growing number of 
photographs of Teslas inside buildings surrounded 
by shattered glass and broken walls, a video from 
Tu Noticia PR in Puerto Rico illustrated the SUA 
phenomenon better than perhaps any evidence 
so far.  In the video, a white Model X appears to 
be preparing to parallel park when it immediately 
accelerates and begins careening uncontrollably, 
crashing into several vehicles and almost running 
over a pedestrian standing across the street.135


As numerous social media users have pointed 
out,136 Tesla is not the only company to have ex-
perienced problems with unintended acceleration.  
Some are convinced that no matter the car brand, 
the problem is merely an excuse for confused 
drivers who jammed the accelerator pedal instead 
of the brake, which in an electric vehicle can, in 
fact, lead to very rapid acceleration.  However, the 
video footage from Puerto Rico showing a Model 
X in a completely uncontrollable state for a long 


duration strongly suggests against a pedal mix-up, at least in that particular situation.


For Toyota, the SUA problem resulted in congressional hearings, litigation, recalls, and 
NHTSA investigations.137  Sticky pedals and defective floor mats were eventually 
blamed, as opposed to Toyota’s controller software (which is far simpler than the 
software that powers a Tesla today).  The financial and reputational hit to Toyota was 
significant, and ended up costing billions of dollars.  It is unclear that Tesla could afford 
a similar debacle in financial terms.  At present, it is accumulating more SUA com-
plaints than Toyota despite selling a small fraction of the number of vehicles per year.

ing frequency on social media posts.138  While 
Tesla used to be known for its customer-friendly, 
Model S mobile service cars, the company has cut 
back on service options to save on costs, and now 
routes virtually all requests through its mobile app.  
Car owners report difficulty reaching actual hu-
man beings and extreme levels of frustration.


One customer, Todd Randall, wrote on Twitter :


“@elonmusk @Tesla I took delivery of my M3 Satur-
day and need to schedule service but the app gives 
me an error message. The Sales and Support experi-
ence has been horrible. How do I schedule service 
with no phone numbers and an error message in your 
app?”139


Like many Tesla customers, his query was ad-
dressed directly to Musk on Twitter, perhaps un-


aware that Tesla’s CEO tends to respond to Twitter accounts with blue identity verifi-
cation checkmarks more often than others.  It’s a reasonable strategy: by helping the 
highest-profile customers with the most followers on average, Musk appears respon-
sive in a very visible way.  But Musk can’t help everyone.  Another customer with the 
name “Mr. Churro” expressed their ire only a few minutes before:


“@Tesla @elonmusk why does it take longer to fix a Tesla than it does to order a brand 
new one?  Wish my insurance would just consider my model 3 totaled and order a 
new one.”140


The answer to this question is that spare parts for Tesla vehicles are hard to come 
by, and due to design and manufacturing flaws, they are in high demand, especially as 
the Model 3 starts to age.  In August 2019, a German car rental company called next-
move cancelled a $5 million order with Tesla for Model 3 vehicles because its man-
agement was so upset with Tesla’s service history.  Managing Director Stefan Moeller 
reportedly stated, “We had to insist on compliance with general quality standards and 
processes in order to protect our renters and our business model.”141

Charging Station Wait Times and Breakdowns


As Tesla’s so-called electric “fleet” has grown, the 
demand for charging stations away from home has 
grown with it.  To keep up, Tesla has contracted 
with shopping malls, gas stations, restaurants, and 
other locales around the world, installing its electric 
chargers wherever Tesla customers might routine-
ly drive.  But even its substantial efforts at building 
out a proprietary charging network haven’t been 
enough.  Now, new regulations may force Tesla to 
upgrade many of those chargers so that custom-
ers can read pricing and status information on digi-
tal displays outside of their cars.


On social media, Tesla owners report excessively 
long wait times in order to charge their vehicles, 
and pictures abound of long lines of Teslas that 
evoke memories for some of the Carter-era oil 
crisis—the last time in modern memory significant 
numbers of Americans had to queue for energy 
necessary for transportation.  Tesla has made weak 
attempts to turn these waits into opportunities 


for fun and entertainment, but as its own customers have 
pointed out (usually directly to Elon Musk on Twitter), it’s 
objectively absurd to spend longer waiting in line for a 
charger than actually driving to get somewhere.


The problem with limited supply for charging infrastruc-
ture has been exacerbated in some cases by chargers that 
are non-functional, sometimes because they or nearby 
equipment upstream has caught on fire.  In November 
2019, CNBC reported on one such charger fire at a 
Wawa store in New Jersey.142


A Culture of Secrets, Fear, and Abuse


Preventing Disclosures


Secrecy culture is nothing new in Silicon Valley, but there is a notable difference be-
tween keeping secrets to promote customer anticipation of new products, and keep-
ing secrets to avoid disclosure of fraud and criminal wrongdoing.  Companies like

https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/tesla-supercharger-fire-at-wawa-store-in-new-jersey.html


“I love the car, but...” has become a familiar refrain.  Social pres-
sure amongst Tesla owners, who often wear their environmental 
consciousness as a badge of pride, seems to force customers to 
condition legitimate concerns with those five words (here, four).

Apple Computer pioneered the former.  Tesla excels at the latter.


In the SolarCity case before the Delaware Court of Chancery, Tesla went so far as to 
cite Theranos to justify its preference of not disclosing the videotape of Elon Musk’s 
deposition.143  It couldn’t have picked a worse precedent.  The CEO of Theranos, Eliza-
beth Holmes, is now facing criminal charges in the Northern District of California.144  
(Tesla’s headquarters is a short drive from Theranos’s former building on Page Mill 
Road in Palo Alto.)


Tesla’s lawyers routinely make requests to federal and state government agencies to 
keep information as secret as possible, whether it involves public safety (Autopilot) 
or details that might conflict with Elon Musk’s promises to the public.  In one case, 
Tesla opted to disregard a court order that required it to turn over video evidence of 
citizen journalist Randeep Hothi’s supposedly reckless driving as he sought to film a 
demo vehicle being used to prepare for Autonomy Investor Day.  Rather than disclose 
the supposed evidence, Tesla dropped its case against Hothi.


When PlainSite affiliate Think Computer Foundation filed two Rule 5.1(f) requests 
with the Delaware Court of Chancery, Tesla’s Board of Directors and even SpaceX 
fought to maintain the veil of secrecy protecting Elon Musk and his colleagues.  Musk 
even went so far as to schedule an announcement for “Version 3.0” of the infamous 
Solar Roof Tile on the day documents were scheduled to be released.  When the 
release was delayed by a day, suddenly, so too was the announcement.  When it finally 
took place, there was no live demo, no video, and no real-world photography to 
accompany it.  Elon Musk was reduced to mumbling fantastic promises to his follow-
ers—appearing 35 minutes late—in the hope that they would at least be temporarily 
distracted.145


Regulation FD Violations


Tesla has now held several conference calls for the purpose of distributing informa-
tion material to shareholders that has not been made available to the public as re-
quired by Regulation FD, 17 C.F.R. § 243.


February 28, 2019 “Media Call”: Immediately following the SEC’s February 25, 2019 
motion to hold Elon Musk in contempt of court, Musk posted a series of tweets on 
February 26th designed to intentionally mislead shareholders into believing that there 
was some potentially positive new announcement coming at 5:00 P.M. EDT on Febru-
ary 28, 2019.  In his words, across three separate posts, “Thursday 2pm / California /

Some Tesla news.”146


Tesla shares rose approximately 7% over the next two trading days.  At 5:00 P.M. on 
the 28th, Musk led an invite-only conference call for certain reporters.  The Los Angeles 
Times later described the call in the following manner in an article entitled, “Tesla’s 
Elon Musk, facing contempt charges, says semi-secret meeting was a mistake:”147


“During the call, in which a cheaper version of the Model 3 electric sedan was an-
nounced, Musk said the company would be closing its retail stores and that it would 
not, as originally forecast, post a profit for the current quarter.  Participants were told 
not to post recordings of the proceedings, and after the meeting Tesla said a recording 
or transcript of the meeting would not be made available to the media or the general 
public.”


Tesla’s initial refusal to make a recording or transcript of the call available was a clear 
violation of 17 C.F.R. § 243.100(a) (“...the issuer shall make public disclosure of that 
information as provided in § 243.101(e): (1) Simultaneously, in the case of an inten-
tional disclosure; and (2) Promptly, in the case of a non-intentional disclosure.”)  This 
intentional disclosure was neither simultaneous nor prompt.


Despite widespread publicity about this state of affairs, the SEC took no visible action 
to follow up.  Later, Tesla did post a recording and transcript of the call, but was not 
reportedly required to pay any sort of penalty.  The transcript includes the quote, at-
tributed to Musk, “We do not expect to be profitable in Q1.  But we do think that 
profitability in Q2 is likely.”  This came only a month after he had expressed his opti-
mism about a Q1 profit.  By the time of this statement Musk had enough data about 
demand for Tesla vehicles to know that a Q2 2019 profit would be nearly impossible.  
He was forced to walk this statement back only a few weeks later.


Musk also stated, “I’m certain we’ll be feature complete with full self-driving this year.”  
Musk knew or should have known that this statement was false.


May 2, 2019 Tesla, Inc. Secondary Offering Call: On May 2, 2019, Tesla held a confer-
ence call regarding its imminent issuance of common shares via a secondary offering, 
which also included the issuance of convertible bond notes.  This conference call was 
similarly “secret” in violation of Regulation FD.  Based on leaked information, on this 
call, Musk projected that Tesla would soon achieve a market capitalization of $500 
billion;148 that as discussed previously, based on no evidence, Tesla vehicles “appreci-

that Tesla would achieve collision repairs “in a matter of hours” despite the fact that 
reports of missing Tesla spare parts are widespread.150


The Secret Twitter Sitter


When crafting its settlement agreement with Musk in the aforementioned “fund-
ing secured” action, the SEC appears to have gone to great lengths to center its 
corrective action around the idea of pre-approval.  Specifically, Musk was supposed 
to pre-approve any public communications on Twitter that could potentially contain 
material information.  What the SEC did not specify, and which later led to consid-
erable friction (including but not limited to the February 25, 2019 motion to hold 
Musk in contempt of court), was who exactly was supposed to pre-approve Musk’s 
communications.  Musk interpreted his settlement agreement to mean that he could 
“pre-approve” his own messages so long as they were “within Tesla corporate policy,” 
while the SEC expected a “experienced securities attorney” to fill that role.


The SEC never specified publicly who the so-called Twitter Sitter would be, and nei-
ther did Tesla.  Even in court filings concerning this issue, the specific identity of the 
“experienced securities attorney” was never disclosed.


If the SEC’s true goal is to hold Musk accountable, it is clearly necessary to specify 
who is part of the chain of accountability.  At the moment, only an anonymous law-
yer can theoretically be held accountable.  From the public’s perspective, there is no 
guarantee that such a lawyer even exists, or that if he or she does, that person could 
be brought before a judge to explain the actions on any given day.  There’s also no 
guarantee that the Twitter Sitter even still works for Tesla, if he or she ever did.


Executive Departures


Since 2016, Tesla has inspired a steady exodus of mid- to high-level executives from 
the company.  Presently, the number of notable departures is over 200, including two 
Chief Financial Officers, two Chief Accounting Officers, and three General Counsels.  
“Unusual” does not even begin to describe how incredibly strange such a tidal wave 
of departures is for an $80 billion company.  The General Counsel role remains vacant.

Retaliation Against Critics and Whistleblowers


While the SEC is a civil enforcement agency and does not have the authority to 
prosecute criminal violations, some of the issues that Tesla whistleblowers have raised 
do involve potentially criminal acts, and others would have had a material impact 
on Tesla shares had their disclosures been properly made by the company.  The fact 
that Tesla has a documented history both of fierce secrecy and of retaliating against 
whistleblowers is therefore significant.


1. Lawrence Fossi (“Montana Skeptic”): Writing on the popular stock market 
website Seeking Alpha in his personal capacity under the pseudonym “Mon-
51 Tesla, Inc.


tana Skeptic,”151 Lawrence Fossi was formerly a fund manager for the Stewart 
J. Rahr Foundation, where he managed over $1 billion in assets.  He evoked 
Elon Musk’s ire by writing over 100 detailed articles justifiably skeptical of Tesla’s 
and Musk’s claims starting in June 2017.  Over time, he gained a following, but 
his notoriety exploded when Musk determined his identity, publicly broadcast 
it, called his boss (Rahr) and demanded that Fossi stop writing.  Not wanting 
to provoke a battle with his own employer, Fossi agreed—at least for a time. 
 
Months later, Musk attempted to smear Fossi a second time as someone who had 
been an Enron lawyer in the early 2000s.  In fact, Fossi is a Yale Law School graduate 
whose prior law firm, Vinson & Elkins, has employed hundreds of attorneys.  According 
to Fossi, he personally  had “zero involvement in any Enron matter” at Vinson & Elkins. 
 
Afterward, Fossi founded his own firm, Fossi & Crain, where he filed a mechanic’s 
lien for a contractor that Enron had refused to pay.  Enron’s bankruptcy trustee 
ultimately tapped Fossi as an experienced litigator who was qualified to represent 
the Enron bankruptcy estate, and after being advised about his client’s existing 
lien, paid the claim and engaged Fossi’s firm.  From that point forward, Fossi’s con-
nection to Enron was recovering letter of credit proceeds wrongfully drawn in 
connection with gas plant projects.  On behalf of the bankruptcy estate, he helped 
recover several hundred million dollars, cleaning up the mess Enron had left.


2. Martin Tripp: Martin Tripp was formerly an engineer working in Tesla’s Nevada 
factory who was disturbed by company practices that he directly witnessed and 


viewed as unethical and wasteful.  He noticed that 
large amounts of scrap material, potentially worth 
what he believed were “hundreds of millions” of 
dollars, were being generated by inefficient and 
problematic manufacturing processes—informa-
tion not disclosed to Tesla shareholders.  He also 
noticed that certain battery cells had been inadver-
tently punctured at the factory, but were nonethe-
less shipped out in new vehicles for sale despite the 
risk of “thermal runaway,” the rapid precursor to a 
fire.  To substantiate his claims, he accessed Tesla’s 
internal database using his employee credentials 
and provided raw data as well as photographs to 
veteran journalist Linette Lopez at Business Insider. 
Tesla’s internal security team in Nevada, partially 


comprised of recently fired members of Uber’s infamous security team,152 detected 
Tripp’s access to Tesla’s systems and confronted him about his activity.  Though they 
noted his concerns, their first priority was containing any possible reputational harm 
to the company, and Tripp was fired after a lengthy exit interview.  After he was fired,

In late June 2018, the Storey County, Nevada Sheriff’s Office was 
informed that Tesla engineer and whistleblower Martin Tripp was 
armed and dangerous.  They found him completely unarmed and 
sobbing.  Fortunately, no one was hurt.  Photograph: Storey County,

a call placed from an unknown individual claiming to be Tripp’s “friend” to a Tesla 
call center suggested that he had plans to return to the Tesla factory with firearms 
and kill as many people as possible in a violent act of retribution.  Tesla Security sent 
out a “be on the lookout” (BOLO) notice accordingly and asked law enforcement 
for assistance locating Tripp, who was considered to be armed and dangerous. 
 
When the Storey County, Nevada Sheriff ’s Office went looking for Tripp, they 
found him at a nearby casino, unarmed and in tears due to the stress of the 
situation.153  Police body camera video released from that encounter shows 
that Tripp suspected that he had been set up, possibly by Elon Musk himself, 
who had e-mailed him earlier that day suggesting that he was an evil per-
son for having blown the whistle.  When Tripp responded, Musk interpreted 
Tripp’s idle comment that Musk “would get what’s coming to him” as a threat. 
 
In a detailed March 13, 2019 Bloomberg Businessweek article entitled, “When Elon 
Musk Tried to Destroy a Tesla Whistleblower,” the article’s authors describe how 
Tesla falsified the threat of gun violence by Tripp in order to discredit him.154   
Tesla also sued Tripp for $150 million, on the supposed basis of the damage 
his disclosures caused to Tesla’s market capitalization.  The case—in which the 
magistrate judge did not disclose that she is a Tesla owner155—is ongoing.156 
 


As securities fraud can be a federal crime pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1348, falsifying 
a threat of gun violence related to whistleblowing activity would likely also be a 
crime in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1513, among other possible statutes.157


3. Linette Lopez: Linette Lopez is Senior Finance Columnist for Business Insider with 
a degree from the Columbia School of Journalism, where she is now an adjunct 
professor.  After reporting on the situation involving Martin Tripp, Musk used his 
platform on Twitter to falsely insinuate that Lopez had received financial compen-
sation from short sellers in exchange for writing negative stories about Tesla.158  
Lopez has continued reporting on Tesla since despite a constant stream of racist, 
harassing and abusive messages directed at her because of Musk’s actions.

Albans, England who now lives in Thailand with his girlfriend.159  Unsworth is also 
an experienced cave diver who became a vital hub for the impromptu rescue

mission set up in the Tham Luang Nang Non cave complex in Chang Rai, Thai-
land.160  When Elon Musk branded him “pedo guy” on Twitter, Unsworth sued, and 
ultimately lost at trial when jurors, confused about the way Twitter works, incor-
rectly determined that Musk’s tweets had not referred to him.  In a bizarre twist, 
post-trial, Unsworth’s lawyer L. Lin Wood made the stunning claim that Musk had 
been right all along and that “justice worked,” suggesting some sort of settlement 
to perhaps avoid an appeal, which Wood denied.161


5. Ryan Mac: Ryan Mac is a journalist for BuzzFeed who covers technology com-
panies in Silicon Valley.  When Mac refused to allow Musk to unilaterally dictate 
which of his comments about Unsworth would or would not be “off the record,” 
Musk responded by calling him an “asshole.”  Later, Musk attempted to subpoena 
Mac in the Unsworth litigation, which resulted in a federal judge calling Musk’s 
tactics “harassing.”162


6. Anna Watson: Reveal source Anna Watson was previously employed by Provider 
Healthcare, LLC as a contractor for Access Omnicare, which in turn was and is a 
contractor for Tesla.  Ms. Watson worked briefly as a Physician’s Assistant at the 
Tesla Fremont factory, until she was terminated in retaliation for disagreeing with 
the treatment plan for a patient who reported to the Tesla Medical Center, which 
she felt was inappropriate.  Not long after she was fired, Child Protective Services 
responded to an anonymous complaint falsely alleging that she was a drug addict 
who was endangering her children.  She has pursued a claim against Tesla with the 
California Department of Industrial Relations, which is on appeal.


7. Unknown Employee: On April 5, 2019, Bloomberg reported that Elon Musk had 
allegedly pushed an employee in the Tesla parking lot, telling him, “I will nuke 
you” as he followed him from the inside of the factory to the parking lot.163  This 
outburst caused the Tesla Board of Directors to open an “investigation.”164  The 
Board found no evidence of wrongdoing, though it also did not release its writ-
ten findings publicly.  The allegations against Musk were nonetheless supported by 
several eye witnesses.


8. Randeep Hothi (“Skabooshka”): On April 19, 2019, Tesla obtained a temporary 
restraining order against Randeep Hothi, one of its vocal critics, who used Twitter 
to share his concerns about the company’s false and misleading statements.165  Mr. 
Hothi had used his observations of Tesla’s factory conditions and vehicles to make 
relatively accurate predictions about the company’s future plans on a number of

occasions.  Tesla painted Hothi, a mild-mannered Ph.D. student, as someone who 
had attempted to physically harm its employees, without providing any direct 
evidence at all.  Hothi denied Tesla’s allegations, which were also refuted by the 
Fremont Police report in the case.  Ultimately, Tesla dropped its case entirely.


9. Cristina Balan: Cristina Balan is a former Tesla employee who worked on the 
battery design for the Model S.  When she believed she had been wrongfully 
terminated by Tesla, the company attempted to shunt her case to confidential 
arbitration.  Balan sued in federal court after the company publicly smeared her 
in an article in the Huffington Post.  Judge Marsha J. Pechman ruled that Tesla was 
required to tell Balan who had been responsible for the remarks.166  That person 
turned out to be Tesla Vice President of Communications David Arnold, who im-
mediately resigned.  Balan was also successful in convincing the judge that Tesla’s 
lawyers had acted in bad faith.  Her case is on appeal before the Ninth Circuit.167


10. Karl Hansen: Karl Hansen is a military veteran and former Tesla Security employee 
who filed a whistleblower complaint with the SEC in 2019 after being fired from 
his position.  Hansen’s complaint alleges that he was told to “investigate criminal 
activity occurring at the Gigafactory,” including “(1) thefts occurring at TESLA’s 
Gigafactory, costing TESLA and their investors somewhere between $37 to $150 
million dollars; and (2) the association of Mexican Drug Cartel members and 
their alleged narcotic trafficking at TESLA’s Gigafactory.”  He is suing Tesla in fed-
eral court in the District of Nevada.168


11. A.J. Vandermeyden: A.J. Vandermeyden sued Tesla in 2017 after she was fired for 
speaking out about the company’s culture of sexual harassment.169  Her case ap-
pears to have settled as of early 2019, but dozens of other similar cases involving 
worker rights are ongoing, including many containing similar allegations.170


12. Russ Mitchell: Russ Mitchell is a journalist for The Los Angeles Times, having previ-
ously worked as an editor at BusinessWeek.171  On October 12, 2019, Elon Musk 
tweeted, “.@DrPatSoonShiong, are you aware that one of your senior journalists 
(Russ Mitchell) is openly funding a fake charity run by an online bully?”  (Patrick 
Soon-Shiong is the billionaire owner of The Los Angeles Times.)  Mitchell had, in 
fact, donated $50 to a GoFundMe campaign run by Think Computer Founda-
tion seeking funds to challenge the California Courts’ public access fee schedules, 
which had nothing directly to do with Tesla (although like many companies in 
Silicon Valley, Tesla has been sued frequently in California state courts).  Musk’s

false and totally unfounded criticism ultimately backfired, with additional dona-
tions finding their way to Think Computer Foundation as a result.


13. Think Computer Foundation: Think Computer Foundation is a small 501(c)(3) 
non-profit organization incorporated in 2000 by the author of this report.  (Some 
of the documents that are sources for this report were paid for by Think Com-
puter Foundation.)  When Musk attacked Russ Mitchell for donating to a “fake 
charity run by an online bully,” he was referring to Think Computer Foundation.  
In December, as promised—and without even raising its full $5,000 goal—Think 
Computer Foundation filed suit against the Superior Court of Santa Clara Coun-
ty, challenging the public access policy, which could set a statewide precedent.172


14. Aaron Greenspan: As the creator of PlainSite, President of Think Computer Foun-
dation, and author of this report, Aaron Greenspan first became interested in Tesla 
around August 2018.  Eventually, after several e-mail exchanges with Elon Musk, in-
quiries to the Tesla Board of Directors about issues in this report, and a threat to sue, 
Musk responded by e-mailing Greenspan, “Does the psych ward know you have a cell 
phone? Just curious.”  Musk then followed up in a separate e-mail with, “ .”  Since 
Musk chose to use the Reply All feature, the libelous messages were CCed to Tesla 
social media influencer Omar Qazi, who promptly posted them publicly on Twitter. 
 
Greenspan was also one of several Tesla critics targeted by “Maisy Kinsley,” a fake 
account posing as a Bloomberg “Senior Journalist” with a personal website, Linke-
dIn profile, Twitter account, and artificial intelligence-generated composite photo-
graph.173  Once it was clear that Kinsley was fake, her accounts quickly disappeared.


The Greek Chorus


If Tesla were a stage drama, it would undoubtedly require a Greek chorus: “a homoge-
neous, non-individualized group of performers, who comment with a collective voice 
on the dramatic action,” per Wikipedia’s current definition.174  Historically, chorus 
members have often worn masks.  In real life, that chorus already exists, and it’s made 
up of Elon Musk’s loudest, most zealous supporters, all of whom sound roughly alike 
thanks to their captivated adulation for Musk and Tesla, what the company “stands for,” 
and to a certain, very selective extent, what it actually does.


Tesla, Inc. has knowingly benefitted from the corporate propaganda spewed by fake 
social media accounts for years.175  Just as state actors such as Russia and China seek 
to convince average Americans that they are engaging on-line with authentic and pas-
sionate citizens nearby, so too has Tesla sought to portray the false narrative that the

company has the support of a upswell of average people who are beyond excited 
about saving the environment and all that their amazing electric cars can do to im-
prove their lives and the world around them.


Undoubtedly, there are many such enthusiasts, and it is also true that thousands 
of them already work for Tesla because they believe in the company’s mission so 
strongly and want to devote their career to the most productive aim they can think 
of: effectively, saving the world.  But, sadly, not every tweet, Facebook post, Instagram 
photograph, or YouTube video is the result of a person’s authentic, unbiased desire 
to make the world a better place.  Tesla’s influence operations are both sophisticated 
and subtle—but there are still telltale signs when something is amiss.


There are dozens of members of the Greek chorus, but a few key actors stand out.  
Some of Tesla’s most vociferous supporters, or those Tesla relies on to bolster its 
viewpoint, have been criminally charged or convicted, sometimes in relation to driving:


1. Omar Qazi: A resident of Torrance, California in the Los Angeles area, Omar 
Qazi was for a time the most aggressive and well-known Tesla enthusiast on Twit-
ter.  Posting mostly, but not exclusively, as “Steve Jobs” (and later, “Steve Jobs [sic] 
Ghost”) with the Twitter handle @tesla_truth, Qazi went to great lengths to high-
light every conceivable feature, attribute, plan, idea, and possibility involving Tesla at 
virtually every hour of the day.  Some of his Tesla advertisements ran afoul of the 
law and Tesla’s own recommendations, such as when he videotaped himself dem-
onstrating Autopilot by running a red light with no hands on the steering wheel.176 
 
Qazi did not limit himself to adulation of Tesla and its co-founder.  He also de-
voted considerable energy to harassing Tesla’s critics, including the author of this 
report.  A series of events constituting escalating harassment via telephone, SMS, 
fax, e-mail, and Twitter led this report’s author to request in November 2019 that 
criminal charges be filed against Qazi for violations of California Penal Code Sec-
tions 166(a)(4), 166(a)(7), 422.4, 653m(b), and 528.5.  Qazi either sent or caused 
to be sent a fax and text messages falsely alleging that PlainSite founder Aaron 
Greenspan possessed child pornography—an odd coincidence given Elon Musk’s 
use of “pedo guy” to smear Vernon Unsworth.  The electronic fax service and 
phone number used was identical to the service and phone number used to send 
another Tesla critic, Paul Huettner, a death threat.  Qazi also repeatedly targeted 
a disabled individual for harassment while knowing full well about his disability.177 
 
Qazi was banned from Twitter for life in late October 2019.  At the time of the 
ban, he controlled numerous accounts linked to his company, Smick Enterprises, 
Inc., which is not and never has been registered with the California Secretary of

Top: A still frame from the “Third Row Tesla” podcast, with special guest “Now You Know,” a Tesla promotional YouTube channel.  Clockwise 
from left, Raj Balwani, Galileo Russell, Sofiaan Fraval, Omar Qazi, Vivien Hantusch, Zac Cataldo, Jesse Cataldo, and Kristen Netten.  These 
individuals, along with financial advisor Eric Steiman, attorney David Tayar, and Vincent Yu, form the core of Tesla’s “organic” marketing efforts 
on social media.  Omar Qazi was banned from Twitter for life for his harassing behavior, which was explicitly endorsed by Elon Musk.  The 
Cataldos formed their channel, which has regularly promoted Tesla stock, with the assistance of a Tesla employee whose involvement has not 
been formally disclosed to viewers.  Neither podcast has disclaimers of any sort concerning investment advice; most are Tesla shareholders.


Bottom: Elon Musk’s personal proxies on financial media networks have long been Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management and Ross 
Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki.  Both are little-known investment management firms that have shilled for Tesla and Musk through good times and 
bad.  Wood, who has famously touted her $4,000-per-share price target for Tesla’s stock, recently sold off a significant portion of ARK’s Tesla 
holdings at around $320 per share, less than 10% of her target price.  Gerber claims to have a degree from Musk’s alma mater, the Wharton 
School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania, in “Business Law,” but according to the University of Pennsylvania, Gerber never received 
such a degree.  Photographs: CNBC, ARK Investment Management, Bloomberg Television

State or Franchise Tax Board despite operating in California since its inception.178  
Qazi was also arrested in 2018 for felony possession of a controlled substance 
(LSD) without a prescription, and marijuana possession, in Port Canaveral, Florida 
as he planned to board a party boat.179  Although those charges were ultimately 
dropped, he was also arrested in 2012 for possession of marijuana while driving 
and possession of two fake identification cards; charges which were also eventu-
ally dismissed.180  Since having been de-platformed from Twitter and Amazon Web 
Services, Qazi has taken his advocacy to Tesla’s “Third Row Tesla” podcast.


2. Katheryn Edwards: Another prolific voice on Twitter and frequent collaborator 
with Omar Qazi, Katheryn Edwards has managed a number of harassing pro-
Musk and pro-Tesla accounts: @Pravduh15 and @TeslaV6.  In 2002, she was ar-
rested for a 2nd degree felony, intoxication manslaughter, as she traveled from 
Austin to San Marcos, Texas, where she attended Texas State University.181  She 
has since worked as a paralegal, as office staff for a Subaru dealership, at a window 
and door company, and as a self-published children’s author.


3. Shawn Anthony Joyce: Also known as Shawn Wylde, or @AFMusk on Twitter, 
Joyce is a veteran and felon convicted of defrauding the Department of Veterans 
Affairs who was imprisoned for four months in 2014, after which he was released 
on parole for three years.  Joyce was featured in The New York Times for his sub-
sequent work fighting on-line harassment, after which he began harassing critics 
of Tesla.


4. James Howard-Higgins: Operating exclusively behind the scenes and not on social 
media, Howard-Higgins is a British convicted felon presently serving time in prison 
who contacted Elon Musk in 2018 with the hope of selling him false information 
about Thailand-based cave diver Vernon Unsworth.  Unsworth sued Musk for libel 
in the United States and the United Kingdom.  Howard-Higgins was successful 
at convincing Musk to pay $50,000 for the false information via Excession LLC, 
managed by Jared Birchall, who had attempted to pose as “James Brickhouse.”182 


5. [Name Redacted]: When the author of this report asked Elon Musk to justify 
some of his statements via e-mail, Musk initially seemed cooperative.  In the end, 
he declined to respond to more specific questions, instead e-mailing a screen-
shot of a Latvian extortion website, where a convicted felon who is the subject 
of a restraining order had posted thousands of false and libelous tirades about 
PlainSite, some of which concerned Tesla.  Above the screenshot was Musk’s final 
answer, referencing these rants: “Your true colors.”  The exchange demonstrated

that Musk was willing to rely on even the most obviously unstable and untrust-
worthy information sources so long as they fit his pre-conceived narrative.


Various career professionals have profited from supporting Tesla and its co-founder:


6. Bonnie Norman: A medical device specialist and former Intel Director of Quality 
& Regulatory Affairs for Digital Health, Bonnie Norman prides herself on being 
an early Tesla investor and adopter.  Her history with the company has given her 
access to top-level executives, including Elon Musk.  According to references to 
court documents in the Tripp litigation that remain sealed, Norman conspired 
with Musk to identify Lawrence Fossi as the individual behind the Montana Skep-
tic Seeking Alpha account.183,184


7. Eric Steiman: Eric Steiman runs Clearbrook Capital Advisors, an investment advi-
sory firm registered to a multi-family home in Brighton, Massachusetts.  Steiman, 
who placed a bet on Tesla in its early days and found it to be one of his best 
trades ever, has run at least one Twitter count known to routinely harass and 
threaten journalists and Tesla’s critics, likely in violation of federal law.


8. David Tayar : An attorney in New York, Tayar has long been an enthusiastic sup-
porter of Elon Musk.  His Twitter account appears as an early follower for several 
other pro-Tesla accounts.


9. Paul J. Hornak: A former Senior Controller for Delta Airlines who attended The 
College of New Jersey (TCNJ) to study for an economics degree as an adult, 
Hornak has been known to harass anyone who dares slight Tesla or Elon Musk.  
As a student, he authored a paper at TCNJ entitled, “Examining the Relation-
ship Between Dividend Yield and Volatility Through the Use of ARCH and GARH 
Modeling,” focused on stock market volatility.  Hornak’s pro-Tesla posts through 
his @PJHORNAK account have been mirrored by what appear to be several 
other fake accounts.


Some chorus members have turned their enthusiasm into a business, raising ques-
tions about payment from Tesla or other Musk entities:


10. Zac and Jesse Cataldo: The Cataldos are a Massachusetts-based father-son pair 
who set up a YouTube channel called “Now You Know” initially intended to post 
educational videos.  Their channel soon became exclusively Tesla focused, with 
Now You Know not-so-subtlely encouraging viewers to buy Tesla stock in several 
episodes.  The Cataldos did not bother to inform their viewers that Tesla Regional 
Manager Steven Mark Salowsky, one of their first guests, had signed on as Now 
You Know’s Creative Director.  In July 2019, Zac Cataldo incorporated Now You 
Know Productions LLC in Massachusetts.


11. Vincent Yu: With a background working in the auto parts industry in Southern

California, Vincent Yu has been an enthusiastic supporter of Tesla, and the propri-
etor of the “Tesmanian” brand of Model 3 accessories, such as coolers and floor 
mats.185


12. Major Earl Banning: Major Earl Banning, PsyD, ABPP is an active duty neuro-
psychologist at Wright Patterson Air Force Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio, 
home to the 88th Medical Group.  Banning is also the co-founder of Frunk-
puppy LLC along with Julissa Bonilla, a Morgan Stanley Digital Marketing Assis-
tant Vice President (and talented artist).  Frunkpuppy operates an eponymous 
YouTube channel that combines cuteness, puppies, and Tesla vehicles in what 
appears to be a highly coordinated “grassroots” marketing campaign.  Banning 
has both personally harassed and supported the harassment of Tesla critics and 
professional journalists on Twitter for some time via his @28delayslater account.  
When pressed about his social media activity, he claimed, “I don’t bother you.” 
 
But journalists have stated that Banning does bother them.  Despite serving as a 
mental health professional in the United States Military, he was one of the first 
followers of a harassing account specifically intended to ridicule Linette Lopez— 
who was previously attacked by Elon Musk—on the basis of her appearance.  And 
other harassing Tesla-related accounts have always been quick to follow Banning.


13. Galileo “Gali” Russell: A 2015 graduate of the NYU Stern School of Business and 
Founder of HyperChange LLC, Russell also operates a YouTube channel, Twitter 
account @Gfilche, and appears on Tesla promotional videos.  On December 17, 
2019, Russell posted an episode of his HyperChange series on YouTube in which 
it took no more than thirty seconds before he made a material, false statement in 
likely violation of federal securities law.  “Tesla does zero marketing.  Literally zero 
marketing, but they’re one of the best selling cars in the world,” he claimed.186  In 
fact, Tesla spent $184.5 million on marketing from 2016-2018 according to page 
88 of its 2018 SEC Form 10-K.


There are other members who are from the younger generation:


14. Johnna Crider : A contributing writer at CleanTechnica, Crider is an independent 
artist who makes wire art involving gems and minerals and refers to herself as 
“The Gem Diva.”187  She credits Elon Musk with saving her life.188  On December 
11, 2019, she started an on-line fundraiser to encourage members of the public 
to donate $50,000 so that she can purchase a Tesla pickup truck.189

done work on predicting the price of gold using computer algorithms and is fas-

cinated by cryptocurrency, “Shami” De Zylva appears to have posted on Twitter 
as @TeslaOpinion and as @DisruptResearch, as well as from his personal account, 
@shamziboy.  “Disruption Research” is an unincorporated, seemingly anonymous 
investment research “firm” with no contact information that claims to be “[c]ur-
rently focused on Tesla, SoftBank, Shopify, Zillow, and Slack.”  Its website has been 
under construction for nearly a year.  De Zylva’s accounts have pumped out a 
stream of positive spin for Tesla and Musk.


16. Vivien Hantusch: A design student and public relations intern190 in Germany, Vivi-
en Hantusch is an incredibly enthusiastic supporter of SpaceX, Tesla, and Elon 
Musk.  She prototyped a user interface for “Pravduh,” Musk’s idea for a mobile app 
(named after the infamous Soviet newspaper, Pravda, meaning “truth” in Russian) 
that would rate the journalists with whom Musk so often seems to disagree.191  
Hantusch has also made a number of professional-quality spec advertisements for 
Tesla products.  Hantusch’s on-line identity is literally intertwined with Elon Musk’s 
work—her Twitter handle, @flcnhvy, refers to the SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket.


Finally, there is the mystery account:


17. @ThemeTeamWP: An anonymous account named for a WordPress blogging 
template designer whose generic icon avatar reveals very little, @ThemeTeamWP 
is the most ardent supporter of Elon Musk on the internet.  Its associated e-mail 
address resembles, but does not match, Musk’s primary Tesla e-mail address.  It 
defends not only every single one of Musk’s business decisions, but his dating 
choices as well.  It attacks critics, and especially short sellers.  It even blames vic-
tims, such as a girl whose finger was caught in a poorly-designed Model X door.  
In addition, the account deletes its tweets, which are only in response to others.  
While its word choice sometimes matches language Musk is known to have used, 
this is not always the case.  The account’s owner has denied being Musk or anyone 
Musk knows, but the ferocity of its positions makes that difficult to believe.


Many of these accounts would not be notable at all were it not for several important 
factors.  First, many (but not all) of them have been involved in aggressive harassment of 
Tesla critics, Musk critics, and journalists.  Lora Kolodny (CNBC), Dana Hull192 (Bloomberg 
News), Linette Lopez (Business Insider), Charley Grant (The Wall Street Journal), Neal 
Boudette (The New York Times), and Russ Mitchell193 (The Los Angeles Times) have all 
publicly commented on the harassment they have received from Tesla supporters at 
one point or another.  The degree of vitriol is atypical relative to most beats.


Second, many of the individuals have been given special treatment by Tesla.  The indi-
viduals running these specific accounts have been far more likely to receive a direct, 
almost instantaneous response from Elon Musk on Twitter than any of Musk’s 30 mil-


190 Hantusch has denied having ever worked in public relations, but “PR” and “Marketing” appear on multiple versions of her 
résumé, as well as a specialty in “Social Media Content Creation.”

lion other followers.  Musk explicitly endorsed Qa-
zi’s conduct on Twitter prior to his being banned.194  
In addition, Omar Qazi revealed that he had been 
invited to the Tesla Model Y launch, an exclusive 
event.195  Similarly, Vivien Hantusch flew from Ger-
many to Los Angeles for the invite-only “Cyber-
truck” launch.  Notably, Tesla has not enforced its 
trademark rights against these holders of social 
media accounts making use of the trademarked 
Tesla brand, suggesting that they may be parties 
to brand licensing agreements.  In fact, it has wel-
comed them as family.  On January 4, 2020, Elon 
Musk’s mother posted a photograph of her son 
and several members of the Third Row Tesla pod-
cast crew at a round table equipped for recording.  


Third, most of these individuals are not merely en-
thusiastic car owners.  They are also Tesla share-
holders, directly in touch with employees at the 


company itself,196 who want to see the value of their in-
vestment increase.


The Talking Heads


The remarks of two individuals with close connections to 
Musk have been notable for their content, which has often 
suggested that they speak on behalf of Tesla, Inc. and Musk 
himself.  Ross Gerber of Gerber Kawasaki Investments and 
Cathie Wood of ARK Investment Management have each 
presented themselves to the public as objective observ-
ers, yet with an unflaggingly hyper-optimistic outlook.


Mr. Gerber, who often appears not to know the basics of 
the financial industry he purports to work in,197 has been 


a Tesla cheerleader for years, despite admitting on video that he owns relatively few 
shares in the company.  On April 18, 2019, he repeated one of Elon Musk’s false talk-
ing points, writing, “Actually zero depreciation in teslas.  They are gaining value.”198  
Gerber’s biography on his firm’s website states, “Ross received his BA in Communica-

tions from the Annenberg School 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
concentrating in Business Law at 
the Wharton School of Business, 
graduating class of 1993.”199  Yet 
Ron Ozio, Director of Media Re-
lations at the University of Penn-
sylvania, could only confirm that 
Gerber had received a B.A. in 
Communications.  In addition to 
there being no record of Gerber’s 
“Business Law” concentration, the 
claim is inconsistent with the Uni-
versity’s policies.  The Wharton un-


dergraduate program awards a B.S. in Eco-
nomics, but since Gerber received a B.A., 
he did not graduate from Wharton, which 
would make a “concentration” awarded 
by Wharton (i.e. four courses) impossible.  
While Wharton does have dual-degree 
programs, Gerber reportedly only has one 
Penn degree.  It therefore seems almost 
certain that Gerber has been lying on his 
résumé for years.  Gerber himself has re-
fused to explain the discrepancy.200


Ms. Wood is best known for her $4,000 
price target for Tesla common shares on 


the basis of amorphous graphs that tend to lack any labels on their axes, or any ra-
tional fundamentals whatsoever.  Though she carries herself with a poised demeanor, 
Wood has a tendency to wax poetic on the potential of technology, making com-
parisons between successful companies and whatever she happens to be promoting.  
She is fond of comparing Tesla to Apple and Amazon, even though those companies 
have completely different business models, as well as track records of earning profit.


To deflect frequent criticism that her uniquely stratospheric $4,000 price target was a 
form of manipulation tantamount to securities fraud, on May 22, 2019, Wood “open-
sourced” her firm’s model for Tesla’s stock price on the popular coding site GitHub.201  
The move immediately backfired.  Within two days, pseudonymous Twitter user and

According to Cathie Wood’s analysts at ARK, “if Tesla sold zero cars and generated

selling activity was not touted on Cathie Wood’s media appearances where she con-
tinued to exude optimism about Tesla and technology generally.  In Q4 2019, ARK 
offloaded about $127.6 million worth of Tesla stock and purchased just over $4 mil-
lion worth, according to trading reports posted on Twitter by a pseudonymous ac-
count.  In other words, while Cathie Wood insisted that Tesla was a screaming “buy” 
destined to soar, her funds disposed of around $123 million worth of shares, net.


According to ARK Investment Management’s SEC Form 13F-HR filed November 12, 
2019 for the period ending September 30, 2019, Tesla was ARK’s second largest hold-
ing across all of its funds in dollar terms, valued at approximately $282.4 million at the 
end of Q3 2019, or 6.16% of ARK’s $4.5815 billion in assets under management.204,205  
Tesla has also historically been the top holding in several of ARK’s individual funds.  
The net sale of Tesla shares in Q4 2019 would have brought Tesla’s share of ARK’s 
entire cross-fund portfolio closer to 3-4%.


But according to a video message posted by Cathie Wood on ARK’s Twitter account 
on October 23, 2019 in response to queries about the firm’s Tesla trades,


“When a stock reaches 10% of our portfolio, we cannot buy it any longer.  We can 
let it run, up to 12, 13...  Sometimes we let it go a little above that—but typically, 
because by that time, the stock has run 30%—has done 30% better than all of the 
other stocks in our portfolio, we will take profits.  This is simply portfolio management.  
Now in the case of Tesla, as you know, we bought it down into the 180 range.  And as 
it approached 240, -50, it had crossed over 12, 13% of the portfolio.  We were taking 
profits because we were getting opportunities elsewhere in the portfolio, particularly 
in the genomics stocks.  Uh, that, uh, we felt, uh, we should take profits and re-allocate 
the funds.  Uh, that’s simply what has happened here with Tesla.”206


A written explanation e-mailed to ARK mailing list subscribers similarly stated:


“As the stock dropped below $200, we increased our position in our flagship strategy 
to 10%, a level beyond which we could not buy based on our investment guidelines.  
Subsequently TSLA appreciated more than 30% relative to the rest of the names in 
our flagship portfolio, pushing its position size beyond 13%, at which point—again 
based on guidelines—we started taking profits.”


This explanation simply does not pass muster.  According to ARK’s own SEC filings, 
its overall holdings in Tesla did not come close to the firm’s supposed (but flexible) 
10% overall portfolio threshold at the beginning of Q4 2019, and given that the en-
tire stock market—and especially other technology stocks held by ARK funds—went 
straight up in November and December 2019, Tesla’s price advanced at roughly the 


204 SEC Form 13F-HR Filed November 112 2019.  https://fintel.io/i13f/ark-investment-management/2019-09-30-0
205 At a closing price of $240.87 on September 30, 2019, ARK therefore held about 1,172,417 TSLA shares total.

same pace as many other technology stocks that ARK holds.  While Wood may have 
been referring to Tesla’s weight in specific funds where its weight is closer to 10%, 
there was still no need to sell shares to reduce Tesla’s weighting; a decision to sell is 
not the same as a decision to “not buy.”  Nor did ARK need to sell roughly 35% of 
its holdings to offset a 30% price gain.  If Tesla were as destined for greatness as ad-
vertised, ARK should have purchased other stocks to reduce its relative reliance on 
Tesla, which would have enabled it to hold onto its valuable Tesla shares.  And in fact, 
ARK did purchase considerable holdings in non-Tesla stocks during Q4 2019, lower-
ing its overall percentage allocation in Tesla with each purchase.  Also odd is that from 
October 11, 2019 forward, Wood’s supposed re-allocation took place all quarter 
long, even when the price of Tesla stock went down.  Finally, it’s difficult to imagine a 
more compelling investment than a stock projected to rise to $6,000 per share from 
$300—even in the field of genomics.  20X gains in mature company stocks are rare, 
especially when starting from the peak of the longest bull market in history.


With all of this in the background, 
on December 9, 2019, Wood ap-
peared on CNBC to discuss Tesla.  
Although she was more than will-
ing to talk on live television for 
nearly seven full minutes about the 
Cybertruck (analyzed from “many 
different angles”), her perception 
of Tesla’s competitive advantages, 
her “bear price” of $700, market 
share, and the supposed fact that 
“Tesla is not an auto company,” 
what she didn’t mention were the 
100 million dollars that her firm 
had just “re-allocated” away from 
this opportunity of a lifetime.  (In 


addition, CNBC displayed a screen about ARK’s Tesla holdings falsely claiming that 
ARK did not have a stake “>1%.”)207


Excessive optimism is not illegal, but securities fraud is.  Wood and Gerber repeatedly 
met with Elon Musk privately.  The distribution of material non-public information 
to select individuals tasked with pumping up a stock price is unlawful.  Gerber and 
Wood enjoyed perks such as exclusive factory tours, access to Musk for interviews, 
and special event invitations, all while they maintained a uniquely ecstatic outlook in 
public.  Yet behind the scenes, ARK was selling weekly.  Throughout it all, producers 
and so-called television journalists at CNBC and Bloomberg were entirely complicit.

CNBC’s December 9, 2019 “Guest Disclosure” graphic for Cathie Wood contained two 
errors.  ARK Investment Management has between 6-12% of its assets invested in Tesla, 
and her close connection to Elon Musk should qualify as “Other Conflicts.”

Accounting Fraud


Given Tesla’s cloak-and-dagger modus operandi, one has to wonder what all the fuss 
is really about.  The answer is simple: for most of its history, Tesla has been a cash-
starved business utterly dependent upon the stock market, which has resorted to 
various forms of accounting fraud to survive.  And it doesn’t want anyone to know.


Dangling The Carrot (For a Price)


One of Tesla’s defining characteristics is the fact that there always seems to be some-
thing bigger and better on the horizon—even if it’s not entirely clear how that thing 
could ever come to pass in the manner that Elon Musk has promised.  In mid-2016, 
as soon as Model 3 production was finally getting underway, Musk began to make 
audacious promises about Tesla’s next model, the Model Y.  Then, when it was finally 
unveiled, many observers had trouble distinguishing the Model Y from the Model 3, 
likely because the Model Y was actually just a barely-modified Model 3 prototype.  
Similarly, the Tesla Semi Truck, punk pickup truck (officially named the Cybertruck), 
second-generation Roadster, robotaxis, and Solar Roof (versions 1.0 and 3.0, version 
2.0 having been lost somewhere along the line) have all given Tesla fans something 
more to look forward to—and to put down deposits on, while other customers 
demand refunds of their deposits208,209 in what effectively amounts to a Ponzi scheme 
with stock attached.  Yet no matter how many fantastic new products Elon Musk an-
nounces and “launches,” steady profits never materialize.


Zero Profitable Years


The reasons for Tesla’s lack of profitability are to some extent subject to debate.  But 
the fact that the company has been short on cash for the vast majority of its existence 
is indisputable.  This dynamic has had serious effects on every aspect of the company, 
and on its CEO’s behavior.


The fact that Tesla has never turned a profit in any of the fiscal years for which it has 
been in existence has had an material and outsized impact on the company’s strategy 
and operations.  The simple truth is that most companies with such a track record 
would have gone out of business after only a few years of such dismal returns.  It is a 
testament to Elon Musk’s endurance and creativity—much of it brazenly illegal—that 
the company is still around in any form at all.


Cash Balances


For years, Tesla has consistently and deliberately overstated its cash position in an

effort to convince investors that the risk of im-
minent demise was always much lower than 
the company’s critics claimed.210  In fact, Elon 
Musk himself was forced to admit that those 
critics were often right, and that Tesla had 
come within weeks of bankruptcy on at least 
one occasion in 2018.211


Tesla has managed to distort its cash figures, 
as many companies do, by blurring time.  The 
company only reports on its cash position on 
the very last day of the quarter—not a range 
or average of how much cash was on hand 
throughout.  This presents opportunities for 
those wishing to boost numbers to draw on 
credit lines or take out loans, just to make bank 
account balances spike for a day.  Tesla’s CFO 
Jason Wheeler admitted to such conduct on 
February 10, 2016.  “Where we closed Q4 


at, $135 million, fully drawn on [the lending facility]...  We 
don’t want to live on this drug.”212  But Tesla has been 
completely hooked ever since.


In March213 and April214 2019, Perseid Capital posted in-
depth analysis of Tesla’s cash burn and cashflow projec-
tions.  On May 2, 2019, just as cash levels were believed to 
be reaching a critical low point, the company announced 
that it would be raising $2 billion in a stock and debt 
sale, temporarily alleviating the cash crunch.  But the new 
round of funding did nothing to solve Tesla’s long-term 
profitability problems.


Cash balances have also been modified by managing ac-
counts receivable (money coming in) and accounts pay-
able (money going out) balances.  In the Delaware litiga-
tion involving SolarCity, Think Computer Foundation was 
able to force the disclosure of portions of a transcript in 
which Lyndon Rive admitted under oath that SolarCity had

Lyndon Rive admitted under oath to moving payroll 
and shifting accounts payable (payments to vendors) 
in order to “meet the covenants.”


On March 5, 2019, the Financial Times finally pointed out what many 
had suspected all along: Tesla’s reported cash numbers do not add up 
and are therefore fraudulent.  Sure enough, two months later, Tesla was 
forced to raise capital from outside investors despite its supposedly 
healthy cash reserve of over $3 billion.  Tesla’s phony numbers have

changed payroll dates and delayed 
paying vendors.  These desperate 
acts made it appear as though the 
company had more cash in order 
to avoid breaching SolarCity’s loan 
covenants.  According to Rive, “We 
did many things to meet the cov-
enants.”


One of Tesla’s “things” has been 
avoiding tax.  Tesla has been sued in 
at least six state and local jurisdic-
tions for failing to pay a variety of 
taxes.  By delaying the registration 
of vehicles with state Departments 
of Motor Vehicles, Tesla managed 
to push taxable events into future 
months and quarters so that it 
could hold onto its cash for lon-
ger.  The delay in paperwork meant 
that many Tesla customers did not 
receive the titles and registration 
papers for their cars for weeks or 
months after they were supposed 
to, and stories on social media of 


Tesla customers driving with only temporary registrations were extremely common.  
In many instances, Tesla was forced to offer to pay for customers’ tickets when those 
temporary registrations expired.  This unusual set of circumstances did not escape the 
notice of the New Jersey Motor Vehicle Commission, which noted it in an investiga-
tive file215 that was attached to a lawsuit filed by Tesla’s outraged competitors.216


Untrustworthy Numbers


Another one of the “things” Tesla has been doing with its balance sheet, as noted by 
David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital,217 is maintaining a billion-dollar line item for Ac-
counts Receivable, which Tesla has attempted to explain away several times using vari-
ous rationales.  Most recently, Tesla claimed that month-long payment delays inherent 
to European banking made it impossible to properly recognize revenue.  As Deutsche 
Bank put it, “Tesla went over why its accounts receivable has been elevated, attributing

it to a large gap in timing between ve-
hicle delivery and cash received from 


banks in Europe (vast majority of buyers use financing to make vehicle purchases).  
The company stated that the gap in the US is 3 days, 7 days in China, and 28 days 
in Europe.”  This is false.  Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA) payments and SWIFT 
wires clear almost immediately.218  Despite Elon Musk’s promise to David Einhorn 
of an “open invitation” to meet and tour Tesla’s facilities, Einhorn has not reported 
that any such meeting or tour has actually taken place, or that there are even plans 
for one.  Prior to Tesla blaming the European banking system, since-departed CFO 
Deepak Ahuja blamed the fact that “the quarter ended on a weekend.”  “Unexplained 
increases in accounts receivable” is a bright red flag for financial statement fraud.219


So is “A significant portion of a company’s sales are recognized at the end of a quar-
ter or year.”  As previously demonstrated in the graph of New York new vehicle regis-
trations, this happens at Tesla every quarter.  As Elon Musk stated himself, “We literally 
delivered half of the entire quarter’s deliveries...in the final 10 days of Q1.”220  In the 
very last moments of Q3 2019, Tesla introduced “Advanced Summon:” an Autopilot-
like technology that allowed car owners to press a button on their smartphone and 
have their Tesla vehicle drive a short distance from a parking space to the owner, 
autonomously.  The rollout generated considerable media hype and at least a few 
near-collisions.  It also allowed Tesla to claim $30 million in previously unrecognizable 
“self-driving” revenue—part of the magic of unaudited quarterly financial reports.221  
Naturally, the timing led some to wonder whether Musk had decided to risk using his 
customers as human guinea pigs, simply to recognize some additional revenue.  In ad-
dition, Tesla registered numerous vehicles to itself in Norway on the last day of 2019.


What these tricks and others indicate are the simple fact that nothing Tesla says can 
be trusted.  Its debt figures are perhaps the only reliable metrics that Tesla releases,

Per the Norwegian Public Roads Administration, on 
December 31, 2019, Tesla registered numerous Model 
3 vehicles to its Oslo-based subsidiary, Tesla Motors 
Norway A/S.  (“Eier” means “owner” in Norwegian.)  
In Norway, leasing companies register vehicles in their 
own names, not the name of the manufacturer.  It 
therefore appears that Tesla has been “delivering” 
cars to itself, possibly to make it appear as though 
“deliveries” are higher than they really are.  This likely 
fraudulent practice is one of many reasons why the 
company’s numbers are completely unreliable.  Source:

since those figures are contained in contracts with 
third parties such as banks and governments.  Ev-
ery other number, from revenue to profit to gross 
margin to unit sales (or proxies thereof) to payroll 
to number of employees is likely fictional due to 
the pressures on Tesla’s successive Chief Account-
ing Officers and Chief Financial Officers to do 
what no one wants to admit: cook the books.


Inventory Lots for Lots of Inventory


Throughout much of 2018 and into 2019, Tesla 
stored cars in inventory in arbitrarily chosen park-
ing lots across the United States.222  Some of these 


lots were dirt fields; others were attached to vacant shopping malls; still others were 
hidden in forests.  Tesla even used its own headquarters parking lot in Palo Alto to 
store vehicles, packing cars so tight that they blocked other cars from ever leaving 
their spaces.


When Tesla’s founders made the decision to sell direct to consumers without involv-
ing third-party dealerships, they presumably hoped to preserve profit margin for Tesla.  
But that decision had additional far-reaching consequences.  First, it meant that the dif-
ference between vehicle production and sales—inventory—would end up on Tesla’s 
books, not the financial statements of its dealers.  Second, it set up Tesla for a collision 
course with numerous state laws that require vehicles to be sold through dealerships.


As Tesla encountered a lag in demand throughout much of 2019 even with some 
tax incentives still in place, inventory levels skyrocketed, requiring the company to 
scramble for storage lots.  As pointed out by Twitter user @JCOviedo6, “It is worth 
noting that while Tesla was originally a build to order company in 2018 in order to 
solve ‘production hell’ Tesla switched to large scale batch manufacturing of various 
configurations of each model (paint color, interiours, et cetera.)  The consequence of

this strategic decision is that Tesla ends up with excess production.”223


Some vehicles sat in the winter snow for months on end without moving.  Even at 
Tesla’s dealership in relatively warm Burlingame, California, inventory vehicles had to 
be regularly re-charged using diesel generators as their batteries would slowly dis-
charge from lack of use.  In Norwood, Massachusetts, idle cars had their tires stolen 
off of them by scavenging thieves in the middle of the night.224


Though Tesla managed to clear much of its inventory from these lots by the end of 
2019, serious questions remain about how that was achieved.  According to Tesla’s un-
audited Q3 2019 SEC Form 10-Q, “Finished goods” inventory at the end of Q3 2019 
was actually up slightly from Q4 2018 in dollar terms, when parking lots nationwide 
were overflowing with vehicles.225  Per the filing, “Finished goods inventory included 
vehicles in transit to fulfill customer orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale 
at our retail and service center locations, used vehicles and energy storage products.”


At the end of Q4 2019, Tesla reported 112,000 vehicles delivered of 104,891 
produced,226 suggesting that 7,109 deliveries came from inventory.  The prior quarter’s 
financials suggested stated that there were 17 “days of sales” worth of “global inven-
tory” available,227 implying 22,000 vehicles worldwide.  So where did the remaining 
16,000 vehicles go?  No one seems to know.


Furthermore, as noted by Twitter user @PlugInFUD, in both Q3 2017 and Q1 2019, 
Tesla reported a “Work in process” inventory line item of exactly $277,175 (numbers 
in thousands).  This exact number also happens to be the median for all “Work in 
process” values from Q1 2016 through Q1 2019.228  Either this is a stunning coinci-
dence, Tesla’s reported numbers are somehow incorrect in a manner that might be 
explained by a repeated spreadsheet error, or accounting fraud is taking place.


Non-GAAP, Undefined, Proprietary Terminology


Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) exist to communicate informa-
tion to members of the public, government regulators, and corporate actors in as 
clear and consistent a manner as possible.  While the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (FASB) publications that comprise GAAP do offer some flexibility for unusual 
situations where rigorous GAAP compliance would unintentionally mislead, the SEC 
tends to require justification for departures.  Nonetheless, Tesla has used a number 
of terms whose definitions cannot be found in GAAP—or anywhere, for that matter.

“Factory Gated”: In June 2018, Tesla proclaimed that it had met its self-declared target 
of producing 5,000 Model 3 vehicles per week by producing vehicles of such inferior 
quality that 86% of them had to be re-worked.229  These vehicles were reported to 
have been “factory gated,” with no clear definition of what that unusual term actually 
meant.  The issues surrounding Tesla’s Model 3 production abilities are reportedly the 
subject of an ongoing Department of Justice probe.


“Deliveries”: Tesla’s most important metric reportable to Wall Street is the number of 
cars it sells per quarter—but Tesla does not disclose that number.  Instead, the com-
pany discusses a black box it calls “deliveries,” but an examination of its SEC filings dat-
ing back years indicates that Tesla has never actually defined what a “delivery” is.  It’s 
possible that a delivery could involve literally “delivering” a car to a random stranger’s 
driveway without payment, for partial payment, or conditional on payment delayed 
for years.   A “delivery” could also refer to shipping cars to Tesla’s undisclosed Chinese 
subsidiaries.  Telsa’s only clue, included in its Q3 and Q4 2019 delivery press releases, 
has been, “we only count a car as delivered if it is transferred to the customer and 
all paperwork is correct.”  Of course, that paperwork could indicate a sale for $0.00.


On October 3-4, 2019, PlainSite sent an e-mail to Elon Musk and Tesla CFO Zach 
Kirkhorn directly, as well as Tesla Investor Relations, inquiring as to what a “delivery” 
actually was.  Our e-mail read as follows:


“Yes or no, do ‘deliveries’ include vehicle purchases made by Tesla subsidiaries in China 
or other non-U.S. countries?  What about sales to used car vendors, e.g. CarMax?  The 
definition is presently unclear and investors deserve clarity on this, especially in light of 
Tesla’s recently announced financing in China and the associated terms.”


No answer was forthcoming.  CNBC reporter Lora Kolodny also received no answer 
to a similar query asking about the new term “cash deliveries.”230


Deposit Refund Problems


Elon Musk has made several different claims on Twitter about Tesla’s refund policy.  On 
January 9, 2019, he wrote, “Btw, you can buy a Tesla online in less than 2 mins & give 
it back for a full refund for any reason Tesla.com.”231  Yet PlainSite has tracked at least 
16 lawsuits over Tesla refusing to honor customer deposit refund requests filed by 
customers or potential customers.232  It has also uncovered dozens of complaints filed 
with Attorneys General of multiple states, including Ohio, Florida and Texas, regarding 
deposit refund failures.

74Reality Check


According to Ashlee Vance’s biography of Musk, Tesla’s use of prospective customer 
deposits on future products to fund operations has unnerved at least one Direc-
tor : Elon’s brother.  “I’m sure Elon would have found a way to make things right, but 
he definitely took risks that seemed like they could have landed him in jail for using 
someone else’s money,” Kimbal Musk was quoted as saying.233  Yet Tesla still does.


Deposited funds do not belong to Tesla and are merely held in trust, although Tesla’s 
accountants have historically had trouble squaring that circle.  From Q2 2010 through 
Q1 2013, Tesla’s SEC filings contained language referring to “segregated accounts” 
because of pesky states like Washington, which appeared to care.  Tesla even “estab-
lished a segregated account for reservation payments in the state of Washington in 
January 2010” and warned, “There can be no assurance that other state or foreign ju-
risdictions will not require similar segregation of reservation payments received from 
customers.  Our inability to access these funds for working capital purposes could 
harm our liquidity.”234  Why this stopped mattering in 2013 is unclear.


Since the end of 2014, when the company stated, “Reservation payments and depos-
its are used by us to fund, in part, our working capital requirements and help us to 
align production with demand,” Tesla has failed to disclose how it uses deposits and 
how exactly it has at some points held about $800 million worth of deposits on its 
books.  And while on May 4, 2016, Musk stated, “I don’t think we want to rely too 
much on customer reservation money as opposed to capital,” as well as, “I think it’s 
important for de-risking the company,”235 he couldn’t help but boast on Twitter almost 
hourly about Cybertruck deposits in 2019—a significant portion of which it appears 
that customers didn’t even authorize.236


Vendor Non-Payment


Throughout its history, Tesla has repeatedly been sued by vendors large and small 
for failing to pay its bills.  The demands in these lawsuits have ranged from as little as 
$2,500 to over $3 million.237  Several suits have also been filed by government tax 
agencies, as Tesla was so delinquent in paying its taxes that it ultimately had to be 
hauled to court in Washington, Ohio, Massachusetts, California, Nevada, and Missouri.


Most recently, Tesla was sued by the successor to Tyco (itself immersed in a major ac-
counting scandal) for failing to pay roughly $60,000 worth of invoices for SolarCity’s 
on-site security systems dating back to 2015.238  Lawsuits like these raise serious ques-

The Fugitive in Accounts Payable


On November 8, 2018, Tesla Group Manager, Global 
Supply Management Salil Parulekar was indicted for 
wire fraud in the Northern District of California due 
to irregularities surrounding his work in Tesla’s ac-
counting department.239  Weak internal controls at 
Tesla allowed Parulekar to use forged documents 
to intentionally redirect $9.3 million of Tesla’s funds 
to Schwabische Huttenwerke Automotive GmbH in 
Germany, instead of Hota Industrial Manufacturing 
Co., Ltd. in Taiwan.  Parulekar’s motive for misdirecting 
the funds is unknown.


Only two months prior, Tesla’s Chief Accounting Of-
ficer, Dave Morton, resigned after only one month on 


the job.240  Chief Financial Officer Deepak Ahuja resigned not long after with a sur-
prise announcement at the very end of the company’s January 30, 2019 Q4 2018 
earnings call.


The Parulekar case stagnated with few hints for a full year before it became clear that 
he was a fugitive from justice and had likely returned to his native India.  To this day, 
it’s unclear what acutally happened to Parulekar.


Warranty/Goodwill Misclassification


Lemon lawsuits involving every model of Tesla vehicle provide compelling evidence 
that the company has deliberately under-reserved funds on its balance sheet to ac-
count for warranty repairs.  Instead of charging service incidents to “Warranty,” in a 
surprising number of cases, Tesla has instead charged a different account: “Goodwill,” 
likely to the tune of hundreds of millions or billions of dollars.  As former fund man-
ager Lawrence Fossi and pseudonymous Twitter user Luis Carruthers explained on 
Seeking Alpha using court documents241 obtained by PlainSite,

sion. But if the repair should have been covered under 
warranty, and is instead booked to an Operating Ex-
penses category, then it becomes an accounting issue 
affecting gross margin.”242


Comments on the Fossi/Carruthers article by 
defenders of the company suggested the remote 
possibility that despite clear demarcations of 
“Goodwill” as the payment account on Tesla ser-
vice invoices, Tesla’s financials might not necessarily 
reflect those designations.  This counter-argument 
reeks of desperation for two reasons: first, Tesla 
invoices are produced not by third-party service 
centers, but by IT systems owned and operated by 
Tesla itself.  Many of the invoices feature internal-
use barcodes indicating that they were produced 
by Tesla’s own enterprise software.  Second, if Tes-
la’s accounting software ignored the designations 
on these documents and instead used some other 
field to determine warranty and goodwill charges, 
that would be tantamount to the company using 
two sets of books: one public and one hidden.


Selling Used as New


In a lawsuit initially filed in the Burlington County, New Jersey Superior Court, former 
Tesla employee Adam Williams alleged that he had been fired after reporting illegal 
sales practices to management, including “failing to disclose to consumers high-dollar, 
pre-delivery damage repairs” and “receiving vehicles designated as ‘lemons’ and, with 
this knowledge, reselling these vehicles without branding the titles of these vehicles or 
offering disclosure, rather than representing the cars as “used” or a “demo/loaner.”243  
The case eventually moved to federal court.244  Tesla was successful at compelling 
arbitration in December 2018; the status of the arbitration is not known.


Posts on social media and on Tesla’s own on-line forums have affirmed suspicions that 
the company has often tried to pass off used cars as new, which is illegal.245  Some 
customers have accepted “new” cars delivered with initial odometer readings of “140 
miles,” though some “demo” cars can be sold as new with high readings so long as

Federal Investigations


According to FOIA responses obtained from the FBI and the FTC, both agencies are 
investigating Tesla for various, still-undisclosed reasons.  Tesla’s SEC Form 10-K has dis-
closed that it is also the subject of a United States Department of Justice investigation 
concerning its production of the Model 3.


The Trouble with Elon Musk


As pointed out by Niedermeyer, Elon Musk crossed over to the dark side as Tesla’s 
CEO as early as 2009 when he raised the price of the Roadster on paid reservation 
holders who were not expecting it:


“[M]ost reservation holders were easily able to afford the increase and had been 
aware of the risks going in, but there was real anger, which didn’t help public per-
ceptions of the company.  After one meeting, Musk told the filmmaker Paine, ‘There 
seemed to be a little bit of anger from some people in the room who felt that we’d 
kind of done a bait and switch ... and that’s sort of a little bit true that there was a bit 
of a bait and switch.  That’s kind of what happened.”251


Admitting to a “bait and switch” scheme is admitting to fraud.  Despite his intelligence 
in certain areas and plenty of charm, a willingness to commit fraud is the summation 
of the many problems with Musk, whose personal pathology has consumed the time 
and attention of his employees, friends, and foes.  It has even inspired a website devot-
ed to tracking Musk’s lies, predictions and pronouncements at http://elonmusk.today.


Drugs


Multiple sources have suggested that Musk is a frequent user of illegal drugs, which isn’t 
especially hard to believe for a man who considered paying a $40 million combined 
fine over a marijuana joke “worth it.”252  This suggestion was further supported when

Musk appeared on a popular podcast hosted by Joe Rogan and smoked marijuana 
on video.  Given Musk’s role as the CEO of SpaceX, a federal government contractor, 
this stunt caused considerable consternation in the corridors of government.  Oddly, 
in one of the more unusual government subsidy awards to have ever taken place, the 
federal government’s response to Musk’s antics was to pay his companies five mil-
lion dollars to ensure that SpaceX employees—presumably other than Musk—were 
operating in a “drug-free” environment.253


Musk has also been embroiled in an odd dispute nominally about his sale of flame-
throwers to market The Boring Company, an endeavor in which Musk has attempted 
to claim credit for re-inventing the concept of the subway, familiar to anyone who has 
used public transportation.  The brother of notorious drug lord Pablo Escobar has 
made his displeasure with Musk known in a series of letters and media interviews.254  
However, the flamethrower dispute may be a red herring.  As Escobar knows, there is 
real money to be made in the drug trade, and Musk apparently sent a Tesla engineer 
to Mexico to speak with Escobar’s staff for some unknown reason.  According to 
Metro, Escobar claimed that drug smugglers were using Tesla vehicles with Autopilot 
to autonomously move drugs.255


Messiah Complex


On July 8, 2018, in the midst of the Thai cave rescue mission (in which Elon Musk at-
tempted to assist rescuers by proposing a miniature submarine that would have to be 


designed, tested and assembled on the fly 
on the other side of the planet), Dr. John 
Grohol used the hashtag “#narcissism” 
when posing a question to Musk about 
his constant need to “leverage every pub-
lic situation for [Musk’s] own aggrandize-
ment.”  In response, Musk admitted that it 
“might be true” that he is “a narcissist.”


Narcissistic Personality Disorder (NPD) 
is a DSM-5 listed disorder involving “im-
pairments in self functioning” and “impair-
ments in interpersonal functioning,” as 
well as “pathological personality traits” of 
antagonism (specifically, grandiosity and at-

tention seeking behavior) that are stable across time, consistent across situations, not 
part of the normal course of development, and not the result of substance abuse.256  
Whether Musk has ever been formally diagnosed with NPD is not known.  But it is 
undeniable that his very public behavior fits well with this set of criteria, as well as a 
less formal offshoot.


One of Musk’s constant refrains—making him sound very much like a certain occu-
pant of the White House—is that despite his iconic, billionaire status, he is actually the 
victim.  Under criticism from the media, he has often emphasized the unexpected dif-
ficulty of whatever task he set out to do, and the unimaginable personal toll that doing 
it has had on him.257  As 60 Minutes reminded viewers, “The 47-year-old billionaire 
has said 2018 has been ‘excruciating,’ ‘the most… painful year of my career.’”258  The 
objective of such plaintive, heart-tugging entreaties is to make the reader or viewer 
feel pity—and many do, even though Musk is a billionaire.


Some of Musk’s public statements could lead one to believe that he might suffer from 
a messiah complex, which, although not described in the DSM-5, does summarize the 
kinds of beliefs that Musk appears to hold.  He has frequently referred to those who 
question or criticize him, including this report’s author, as “unethical,” “endangering the 
public,” “misleading,” or in one case, almost a murderer.  To be clear, these determina-
tions were made only because of questions initially asked in a non-public setting over 
e-mail.259,260  The inescapable conclusion is that Musk views himself as a an infallible 
protector of the public, relying on unique insights (“data”) that only he has access to.


Were Musk just another average Silicon Valley billionaire, this kind of pathology might 
not be so alarming (or even uncommon for that crowd).  Unfortunately, Tesla’s prod-
ucts are used on public roadways daily, where the public is potentially in harm’s way 
should anything be awry.  And because Musk refuses to acknowledge error or take 
advice from hardly anyone, the public danger he so quickly and easily projects onto 
others is magnified significantly.

260 When pressed to justify his views, Musk further appears willing to turn to any source of information at all, without any 
concern for fact-checking or accuracy, so long as that source supports his view.  In an e-mail exchange with this report’s 
author, Musk ultimately relied upon anonymous posts on a Latvian-based gripe site run by Latvians and Russians who ex-
tort victims wishing to have false information removed about them from the site.  In Unsworth v. Musk, Jared Birchall, who 
runs Excession LLC for Musk, posed as “James Brickhouse” and ultimately ended up paying a convicted felon $50,000 for 
unverified, false information merely to support Musk’s speculation about Vernon Unsworth’s motives for criticizing him.
80Reality Check


vincing as many people as possible to act and transport themselves in a responsible 
manner, Elon Musk spends an enormous amount of time on his private jet.261  In fact, 
in the past decade, Musk hasn’t just owned one jet.  He’s owned three.


There’s also some debate as to whether electric cars are always as environmentally 
sensible as they might seem.  Although electric vehicles emit less CO2 than gas-
powered vehicles as they are driven over time, their manufacturing is expensive from 
a carbon standpoint.  For infrequent drivers, there are some cases where traditional 
internal combustion engines actually make more sense from a carbon perspective.262  
Most economic models also assume that electric vehicles have lifespans comparable 
to traditional cars, but in a country like Norway where one in five Teslas was involved 
in an accident in 2018, that may not be a reliable assumption.


Still, one could plausibly argue that saving the world requires exceptional measures, 
and Tesla does have partners in Japan, a factory in China, and a promised new complex 
coming in Germany.  But when the factory itself is the source of repeat environmental 
violations and the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) needs to get 
involved, the excuses start to wither.  Tesla’s Fremont paint shop, for example, has had 
constant problems with emissions violations.  Tesla has faced repeated scrutiny from 
the Bay Area Air Quality Management District for its paint shop emissions.263  It also 
settled with the EPA for a wrist-slapping $31,000 on April 1, 2019 due to hazardous 
waste violations—and had to purchase the City of Fremont “$55,000 in emergency 
response equipment.”  That amount happened to correspond to the value of an out-
dated Tesla Model S, which the City painted black and white and outfitted with police 
lights.  By September, the same vehicle was the subject of an embarrassing news story: 
“Cop’s Tesla runs out of battery power during high-speed chase,”264 though it wasn’t 
the car’s fault.


“Zero Emissions”: For years, Tesla vehicles have sported temporary license plates that 
are actually advertisements stating, “ZERO EMISSIONS.”  The notion that Tesla cars 
can be manufactured and operated without contributing any carbon dioxide or other 
emissions to the environment is patently false.  Electric vehicles mostly move the 
source of emissions from the tailpipe to the electricity producer.


Sometimes, the electricity producer is Tesla itself.  On March 6, 2019, PlainSite pub-

some of the redacted materials had to remain so due to un-

appears in only two blocks of redacted text at the outset of 
Elon Musk’s second deposition session on August 24, 2019.  
Failures to properly redact the index, and the fact that re-
dacted, indexed terms are still listed in alphabetical order, sug-
gest that Musk used the words “cancer,” “neck,” and “surgery” 
in the redacted block of text, after which opposing counsel 
asked Musk if he was taking any substances that would pre-
clude him for answering questions truthfully.  Although it is not 
yet clear precisely what was said, the deposition proceeded.


Then, on early December 17, 2019, Musk appeared in pho-
tograph posted by the North American Aerospace Defense 
(NORAD) Command Twitter account, where he appeared 
with a scar on the right side of his neck.266  The photograph 
was taken at SpaceX headquarters in Hawthorne, California 
the previous day.  Internet commenters initially focused on 


Musk’s slightly enlarged jaw, but missed the scar.


Plenty of minor medical procedures could theoretically result in a neck scar, such as 
a lymph node biopsy, stitches after a bike accident, or thyroid surgery.  The likely is-
sues were narrowed when spontaneously, three days after the photo was taken, on 
December 19, 2019, Musk tweeted, “You don’t hear much about element 43,” which 
is true—unless you happen to be visiting an endocrinologist regarding a thyroid nod-

A Pliant Board


When the SEC required Elon Musk to step down as the Chairman of Tesla’s Board 
and to appoint two new independent directors, he complied, but only on paper.  


At least one of his new appointees was 
anything but independent, and his replace-
ment possibly shouldn’t be able to serve 
as the director of any company at all.


New Board Chairwoman Robyn Denholm 
was previously Executive Vice President 
and Chief Financial and Operations Offi-
cer of Juniper Networks, as well as Head 
of Strategy and CFO of Telstra, an Austra-
lian telecommunications company.267  Her 
roles resulted in Denholm being named as 
a defendant in federal securities lawsuits 
no fewer than nine times before she even 
joined Tesla’s Board.  The allegations in 
these suits sound familiar to anyone who 
has followed Tesla’s trajectory.268  Denholm 
is perhaps most famous for stating that 
she believes that Elon Musk—whom she 
is supposed to supervise in her capacity as 
Chairwoman—uses Twitter “wisely.”269


The other “independent” directors on the 
Tesla Board appointed as a result of the 
“funding secured” Twitter debacle were 
Kathleen Wilson-Thompson and Larry El-
lison, a friend of Musk’s.  Aside from his 


billions of dollars in Tesla stock ownership, Ellison’s company, Oracle, purchased a fleet 
of Tesla vehicles, making the idea of his independence laughable.


The Board’s conflicts are seemingly too endless to enumerate.  SolarCity lawsuit 
documents obtained from the Delaware Court of Chancery at least attempt to high-
light all of the ways that the Directors have been unable to make clear decisions to

“hands-on” manager overseeing Juniper’s finances and accounting and participating in the 


Company’s earnings conference calls, and was one of the people with “ultimate authority” and made 


the material false and misleading statements described herein.  Denholm was intimately 


knowledgeable about all aspects of Juniper’s business operations, as she received daily reports and 


had access to computerized information regarding sales, costs and expenses, product demand and 


inventory management.  Denholm was also intimately involved in the preparation of Juniper’s 


financial statements and earnings guidance, including Juniper’s sales growth, product demand, 


expenses, inventory management, anticipated gross margin, what disclosures would be made, and 


the functioning of Juniper’s internal financial, accounting and disclosure controls.  Denholm made 


various public statements for the Company during the Class Period, and participated in all Class 


Period earnings conferences and the 2010 and 2011 Analyst Day Conferences.  Denholm also 


reviewed, approved and signed certain of Juniper’s SEC filings filed during the Class Period, 


including the August 10, 2010 Registration Statement, the 2010 10-K and all quarterly financial 


reports on Form 10-Q, and the Sarbanes-Oxley certificates filed therewith.  During the Class Period, 


Denholm sold 88,480 shares of Juniper stock at artificially inflated prices while in possession of 


material non-public information, receiving more than $3.2 million in proceeds.  These sales were 


suspicious and unusual both in terms of timing and amount and wholly inconsistent with Denholm’s 


past sales.

as the “Individual Defendants.” 


V. MATERIAL UNDISCLOSED FACTS CONCERNING JUNIPER’S BUSINESS 


30. On February 23, 2010, after the close of trading, Juniper hosted its Analyst Day 


Conference with analysts and investors.  Defendants set forth their long-term business plan for the 


Company, which called for 20% or higher revenue growth, and a 25% or higher operating margin 


over the next three to five years.  Explaining the Company’s purportedly then-present strong metrics 


that supported this guidance, Johnson emphatically stated, “Make no mistake about it. We're a

guide the company in a responsible manner consistent with their fiduciary duties.270


Knowing When To Stop


When arranged in a particular order, Tesla’s car models (minus the Roadster) spell 
“sexy” in leetspeak, a manner of typing that replaces certain Latin characters with 
look-alike numbers.  Since the “3” character approximates a backwards “E,” S3XY gets 
the job done—a fact that Elon Musk has made it clear he is very proud of.


Unfortunately for Tesla as a company, there was very little time or need to develop a 
Model Y.  Much like the “funding secured” debacle, the entire reason for the Model Y’s 
existence appears to be nothing more than Musk’s insistence that he be able to make 
this joke.  As one might expect, the vehicle’s technical and design specifications have 
suffered accordingly, making it nearly impossible to differentiate the Model Y from the 
Model 3 that it ended up being based upon.


The bad jokes keep coming.  On May 7, 2019, the Tesla Twitter account wrote, “The 
world of autonomous driving is coming whether you want it or not.  With a Tesla, 
you’re ready for it.”  A Twitter user responded with, “Ok please don’t kill my family,” 
and in turn, the Tesla Twitter account replied, “mmm ok.”


Too Many CEO Roles


The fact that Steve Jobs famously worked as the CEO of Apple while also acting 
as CEO of Pixar Animation Studios has led to a number of cases where Silicon Val-
ley notables have insisted that their manifold talents be spread across a number of 
enterprises simultaneously.  For example, much to the initial dismay of his investors 
(who seem to have grown accustomed to it), Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey also decided

Elon Musk’s insistence on making a joke has caused Tesla to spend millions of dollars designing and planning production for two car models 
that are nearly impossible to distinguish from each other, and that will likely cannibalize sales in the marketplace as a result.  Left: Tesla Model

to spend part of his time as CEO of the payments company Square.


Perhaps hoping to show that his abilities exceed even those of Jobs and Dorsey, Elon 
Musk is CEO of the combined Tesla-SolarCity corporate structure (having previously 
been CEO of Tesla and Chairman of the SolarCity Board), CEO of SpaceX, CEO 
of the Boring Company, CEO of Neuralink, and de facto leader of the “hyperloop” 
movement.  While Musk’s ambition may be super-human, he is, at the end of the day, 
still a mere mortal subject to the same constraints of space and time as everyone 
else.  It’s therefore difficult to understand how he can give all of these enterprises his 
best.


Other Red Flags


Government Subsidy Dependence


Were it not for constant infusions of cash from state, federal, and international gov-
ernments, whether in the form of direct loans, tax subsidies, or investments, Tesla 
would not exist.  Over its nearly seventeen years in business, Tesla has received billions 
of dollars in government incentives, earning Elon Musk the moniker “subsidy truffle 
hound,” a term coined by Twitter user @ElonBachman.


United States Department of Energy: In 2009, Tesla was the beneficiary of a $465 mil-
lion loan from the Department of Energy.  The loan (along with partnerships with and 
investments from Daimler, Toyota and Ford) allowed Tesla to design and manufacture 
the Model S.  The loan was fully paid off by 2013.271


United States Department of the Treasury, Internal Revenue Service: In economic 
terms, when it comes to cars, Tesla sells goods that are extremely elastic: as the price 
of a vehicle decreases, there is a disproportionate increase in demand.  For this rea-
son, tax incentives that actually take dollars off of a car’s sticker price are the most 
powerful kind.  When Congress passed the Energy Improvement and Extension Act 
of 2008, it added Section 30D to the Internal Revenue Code.272  From this legislative 
addition, IRS Form 8936 was born, permitting purchasers of electric vehicles up to 
a certain threshold per manufacturer—200,000 for Tesla—to claim a tax credit of a 
declining amount depending upon the time of purchase, starting at $7,500.  The tax 
credit was finally phased out on December 31, 2019, its renewal having been blocked 
by Donald Trump.273  The availability of the tax credit, combined with the knowledge 
of its looming phase-out, has led to end-of-quarter mad delivery scrambles for Tesla, 
where employees and friends have been enlisted as “volunteers” for the $80 billion

company so that customers might receive their vehicles before the federal deadline.


ZEV Credits: Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) credits are issued by the California Air Re-
sources Board, and amount to a basic carbon offset trading system.274  Manufacturers 
of electric vehicles such as Tesla earn credits from the Board based on the number 
of cars they manufacture.  Those credits can then be sold to other vendors for cash.  
(California buyers of electric vehicles also receive the benefit of being able to drive in 
diamond lanes even when a carpool of at least two people is not present.)


Over Memorial Day weekend in 2015, author Edward W. Niedermeyer videotaped 
a truck stop halfway between San Francisco and Los Angeles where Tesla had estab-
lished several charging stations to determine whether any customers were actually 
taking advantage of its battery swap program, which allowed vehicles to instantly 
charge to near full capacity.275  Having the battery swap program in place allowed 
Tesla to qualify for bonus ZEV credits from the California Air Resources Board worth 
potentially as much as $100 million.  He determined that no customers were using 
the program despite busy traffic, but several did take advantage of the temporary 
diesel-powered chargers that Tesla brought in to handle the extra holiday load.


ZEV credits have been crucial to Tesla’s survival.  The company has grown dependent 
upon selling hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ZEV credits to other auto manu-
facturers, in some cases transforming quarterly losses to quarterly profits.276


California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority 
(CAEATFA):  Since 2011, Tesla has qualified for over $225 million277 in sales and use 
tax exemptions from a state government program promising to create jobs in Cali-
fornia, theoretically overseen by the California State Treasurer’s Office.  At first, Tesla’s 
CAEATFA applications related to the manufacture of the Roadster, Model S and 
Model X at its Fremont plant, as well as the creation of jobs in smaller, satellite offices 
in Southern California.  The company successfully applied again when Model 3 manu-
facturing began, making Tesla CAEATFA’s number-one recipient of tax exemptions. 
 
According to public records released by CAEATFA, Tesla has never disclosed its plans 
to build an increasing number of vehicles in China to California, although shareholder 
materials and statements by Elon Musk have suggested that the company plans to use 
its knowledge from manufacturing in Fremont at its new Shanghai plant.  In effect, Cal-
ifornia taxpayers are subsidizing a billionaire’s efforts to move jobs overseas to China.

https://techcrunch.com/2019/06/03/why-gm-and-fiat-chrysler-are-buying-teslas-regulatory-credits/
277 Two SpaceX applications totaling $42.2 million in anticipated tax exemptions have also been approved by CAEATFA, 


making one individual, Elon Musk—who was already a billionaire when his companies began applying—the primary 
beneficiary of nearly $270 million in state tax benefits.
86Reality Check


CAEATFA’s relationship with Tesla could be described as extremely cozy.  Tesla staff 
lobbyist Dan Chiu has regularly provided CAEATFA Executive Director Deana Carrillo 
with advance notice of negative news stories so that state government officials can be 
prepared to field questions from the media in advance.  Carrillo has also provided Tesla 
with advance copies of official government documents about Tesla.  The relationship 
was so cozy, in fact, that Robert S. Hedrick, a government lawyer working for the Office 
of the Chief Counsel of the Department of Water Resources, felt comfortable asking 
if CAEATFA staff could arrange a tour of Tesla’s factory for his son’s “manufacturing 
innovation class” as a field trip.  CAEATFA delegated review of Tesla’s applications for 
tax exemptions to a consulting firm called Blue Sky Consulting Group, which set up 
CAEATFA, and whose consultants mainly used to work in California state government. 
 
In early 2019, Elon Musk made a series of pronouncements about Tesla’s likely manu-
facturing output and “delivery” volume for the rest of the year.  But materials provided 
by Tesla to CAEATFA weeks earlier under penalty of perjury in some ways directly 
contradict Musk’s exuberant predictions.  Tesla specifically asked for these materials

After Think Computer Foundation made a Public Records Act request, Tesla specifically asked CAEATFA to keep these numbers confidential.  
CAEATFA released them by mistake—twice—along with a list of Tesla’s vendors.  The figures show that Tesla’s plan (submitted under penalty 
of perjury) was wildly different from what Elon Musk told investors they could expect: worldwide demand of up to “700,000 or 800,000 units 
in a year” for the Model 3 alone, and in a recession, “still something in the order of 500,000.”  Tesla told CAEATFA to expect half that, at most.

While Musk promised annual demand of up to 800,000 Model 3s, Tesla told CAEAT-
FA to expect 250,000 deliveries per year at most, suggesting further securities fraud.  
The documents also identified specific employees responsible for the figures.


New York State “Buffalo Billion” Initiative: Under the leadership of Governor Andrew

Tesla will owe a $41.2 million penalty to New York State if it does not employ 1,460

Chinese Communist Party (CCP): In China, figurative red flags meet literal ones.  The 
CCP has provided Tesla with $1.3 billion worth of financing through a syndicate of 
state-controlled banks at an interest rate below what is typical (“the market quoted 
interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.7625%”).286  Meanwhile, 
United States shareholders still have no idea which legal entity really owns the new 
Shanghai factory, which Chinese entities with “Tesla” in their name are actually affili-
ated with Tesla at all, or why one entity previously mentioned in a Tesla SEC filing, Tesla 
Automobile (Beijing) Co., Ltd., was once called Tuoluo Vehicle Sales (Beijing) Co., Ltd.

Fleeing Lawyers


Tesla has had a surprisingly difficult time retaining lawyers to fill its General Counsel 
role.  At the end of 2018, the position was vacated by Todd Maron, who had served 
in that position since September 2014.  Then, Williams & Connolly attorney Dane 
Butswinkas stepped in.  He lasted only a few weeks before resigning.  Presumably 
unable to find another candidate from outside the company, Tesla promoted from 
within, giving the title to longtime corporate attorney Jonathan Chang.  He lasted 
roughly ten months, leaving in early December for SambaNova Systems Inc., a startup 
in Palo Alto.287


Tesla has also had trouble retaining large law firms to represent the company in the 
hundreds of lawsuits it has faced nationwide.  Some of the turnover might be best 
described as a deliberate cost-cutting measure, owing to the company’s historically 
precarious and opaque cash situation.  But some of the decisions of major firms to 
give up on Tesla may have been because they never got paid or grew uncomfortable.


On November 11, 2019, the law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz filed a motion 
to withdraw from representing Tesla’s Board of Directors in the ongoing SolarCity liti-
gation before the Delaware Court of Chancery.  Wachtell, widely considered the top 
mergers and acquisitions law firm in the United States, had represented the Board 
for years.  While a reason for the withdrawal was not specified, the filing came at an 
unusual time, after the Board had already filed its motion for summary judgment—
one of the last steps before an actual trial.  This could be because in late September, 
PlainSite affiliate Think Computer Foundation filed a request pursuant to Rule 5.1(f) 
of the Rules of the Court of Chancery, which set in motion a process that ultimately 
resulted in many of the case’s deposition transcripts being made public.  On Novem-
ber 5, 2019, Think Computer Foundation filed a second Rule 5.1(f) request concern-
ing redactions in the materials that had just been released.  Six days later, Wachtell 
filed its withdrawal motion.


Criminal Counsel on Retainer


One day after Wachtell’s attorneys filed their withdrawal paperwork with the Dela-
ware Court of Chancery, a new attorney appeared on the docket: Benjamin Gruen-
stein.  Unlike the Wachtell attorneys, one of Gruenstein’s areas of focus is white collar 
criminal defense.288  Specifically, “Mr. Gruenstein’s practice focuses on the representa-
tion of U.S. and multinational companies and their senior executives in government 
and internal corporate investigations in such areas as the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (‘FCPA’), healthcare fraud, insider trading, criminal antitrust, accounting fraud and 
trade sanctions, and accompanying civil litigation.”

The Case of Cheryl Crumpton


Several court filings signed by Elon Musk in the SEC’s case against him,289 such as Doc-
uments 42 and 44, lack any contact information for Musk’s counsel or Musk himself, 
in clear violation of Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(a).  Before these documents 
were filed, Musk had been represented by counsel, yet there is no mention of his law-
yer in the substance of these status update documents or in the deficient signature 
blocks.  These documents were submitted to the court’s CM/ECF system by the SEC, 
not by Musk or his counsel.


This raises a number of questions.  Why did the SEC allow Elon Musk to sign his name 
to a court document without providing his contact information as required by Rule 
11?  Was Musk represented by counsel as he negotiated with SEC attorney Cheryl 
Crumpton?  If so, why was his counsel not listed as being on the court mandated 
conference call(s), according to the SEC’s recounting, and why did counsel not sign 
the status updates?  If not, why did his counsel not follow Civil Local Rule 1.4 and 
withdraw from the case after obtaining Judge Nathan’s permission?  Was anyone else 
other than Tesla’s counsel on the line to make a record of the call?  And why did the 
SEC turn a blind eye to these rule violations?


These questions are especially interesting because weeks after the highly irregular call 
for which Musk’s lawyer seems to have disappeared, SEC attorney Cheryl Crumpton 
left the SEC and began working for Exelon Corporation, which is suing the United 
States Environmental Protection Agency as part of a small lobbying group called the 
“National Coalition For Advanced Transportation.”290  One of the Coalition’s other 
primary members is Tesla, Inc.  Regardless of how Cheryl Crumpton found her way to 
her new position outside of government, if Musk was not represented by counsel as 
he negotiated with the SEC, investors were not made aware of this material fact.  Few 
investors would want to put their money into a multi-billion dollar company where 
the CEO could be foolish enough to represent himself pro se before a regulatory 
agency while attempting to avoid a contempt of court charge.


Accelerating Lawsuits


Tesla’s litigation burden has been accelerating at an exponential pace since roughly 
2014, to the point where it will likely face over 300 lawsuits of consequence in the 
year 2020.  There are several reasons for the steady increase in litigation.  First, Tesla’s 
acquisition of SolarCity opened the company up to liability from problems with solar 
panels, which can take a variety of forms.  Numerous plaintiffs have sued for roof 
damage, whether from water, snow, structural damage, or fire.  Second, the afore-

mentioned quality problems with 
Tesla’s manufacturing process have 
led to a slew of lemon lawsuits al-
leging that Tesla was unwilling and/
or unable to repair problems with 
the Model S, Model X and Model 
3.  Third, Elon Musk’s non-stop lies 
on Twitter have led to Tesla facing 
around 40 securities lawsuits,291 
which is an exceptionally high 
number for most publicly traded 
companies.


While many of these lawsuits in-
volve small dollar amounts, others 
involve potential damages of tens 
of millions, if not billions, of dollars.  


A lawsuit filed in Riverside County, California in which Tesla, Inc. is simply named as 
a defendant could potentially yield damages of $25 million to be shared among the 
various defendants in the case.  Even if Tesla’ share of damages in that case were 
hypothetically only $2 million, it might cost another $100,000 in legal fees just to ap-
pear in court and make the requisite arguments to convince a judge and jury that the 
company’s hardware design did not play a consequential role in the particular crash 
being litigated.


Incompetence


The stores are open.  The stores are closed.292  Some stores are open, others are 
closed.293  Some are closing, but the ones that are open might not sell cars.  Also, 
prices are going up soon.  But prices are going down.  Actually, they’re up.  Buy now.


Such was the narrative coming from Tesla in early 2019, when sheer incompetence 
appeared to be the company’s north star.  Trapped in a vice between cost-cutting 
and needing to drive waning demand, Musk and his minions managed to confuse just 
about everyone, from journalists to prospective customers to critics and passers-by.


Every company goes through growing pains at some point along its development, 
but by the time this particular spasm of stupidity engulfed Tesla, it had already been in 
business for about 16 years.  Then, well after the mystery of Tesla’s retail future settled 
down, there was news of a new problem: boats full of Model 3s were being diverted

Tesla, SolarCity and Elon Musk have faced a steadily increasing number of lawsuits.

Short Sellers


Tesla’s serious financial problems 
made it at one point the most 


shorted stock across the en-
tire United States stock 
market,294 while also at-


tracting the attention of 
prominent short sellers such 


as Jim Chanos (Kynikos Associates 
LP) and David Einhorn (Greenlight Capi-


tal).  Elon Musk has made no secret of his special 
disdain for short sellers,295 having at times argued pub-
licly—with no substantive basis whatsoever—that the 
practice should be made illegal.296


Serious short sellers have an amazingly good track 
record when it comes to detecting fraudulent mar-
ket conduct, especially when occasional short sell-
ers who frequently change sides on their invest-
ments are excluded from the analysis.  While they 
are loathed by some for so-called “short and dis-
tort” schemes that aim to spread negative false 
information to drive down the price of a stock, 
the problem of “pump and dump” involving 
positive false information on the long side is 
no different at its core, and is far more preva-


lent in bull markets.


Tesla has attracted the attention of 
more short sellers on social media 


than possibly any stock in history.  After

ed in SEC action, a collective of mostly 
anonymous Twitter accounts, informally

anonymous creator of “TeslaCharts,” who would post literally and figuratively colorful 
graphs concerning Tesla’s financial performance behind the avatar of an enthusiastic 
carnival barker, in clear reference to Elon Musk.  In nearly two years, @TeslaCharts 
amassed over 18,200 followers.


The existence of $TSLAQ hasn’t slowed down Musk’s progress, but it has clearly 
gotten under his skin on occasion.  And though specific members of the informal col-
lective can sometimes be excessively paranoid, petty, crude, or just flat-out wrong, the 
quality of information disseminated in real time on Twitter is comparable to or better 
than many paid wire service subscriptions.  It is not uncommon for $TSLAQ mem-
bers to monitor, photograph, videotape, and otherwise report on relevant events 
involving Tesla in their hometowns.  The movement has also seen a growing number 
of former Tesla customers and supporters join their ranks.


Tesla Insurance


Due to the unresolved quality problems with the Model 3, especially including the 
fire risk that Teslas appeared to be especially prone to throughout 2018, numerous 
insurance companies across the United States began raising their insurance rates for 
Model 3 owners.  Elon Musk’s response was that Tesla would start its own insurance 
company.


This proved to be more difficult than he had anticipated.  Tesla Insurance started out 
in a San Francisco office sharing suite at 444 De Haro Place in Potrero Hill, where 
a single employee, Anthony Vincent Retort, showed up on all associated paperwork.  
Retort left Tesla in June 2018.  He was replaced by Matt Edmonds, working from 
Alpharetta, Georgia.  Edmonds describes himself as an “Innovator who Takes New 
Solutions to Market for InsureTech Startups and Insurance Disruptors” on LinkedIn.


In August 2019, Tesla Insurance Services finally launched in California—at least for a 
few hours.298  Due to an apparent glitch with the website, the insurance quote gen-
erator immediately began providing prospective customers with insurance quotes 
that were far too high, leading Tesla to shut off the service within hours of turning it 
on.  When the quote generator finally returned days later, pricing was more in line 
with customer expectations, but the problems didn’t stop there.


Several Tesla Insurance customers have since reported that even after paying their 
insurance premiums, the State of California Department of Motor Vehicles sent them

notices informing them that their car registrations would not be renewed.299,300


This is possibly in part because Tesla Insurance is not actually an insurance company.  
Rather, it’s a brand that has been attached, at least for the time being, to State Na-
tional Insurance Company of Texas, which filed applications for a special Tesla insur-
ance plan with the California Department of Insurance in January 2019.  The plans 
were approved in April 2019.  State National customized a policy for Tesla by copying 
and pasting verbiage relating to a discount for autonomous vehicles from a policy 
issued by Response Indemnity Company’s approved class plan (application number 
17-6660).  This is somewhat ironic given Tesla’s marketing copy for its insurance plan, 
which states, “Tesla uniquely understands its vehicles, technology, safety, and repair 
costs, and eliminates fees taken by traditional insurance carriers.”  Its understanding 
is so “unique,” in fact, that it’s exactly the same as another insurance company’s unre-
lated policy from 2017.


According to Musk’s logic, Tesla vehicles should be less expensive to insure because 
they are so much safer, according to the “unequivocal” data that at least so far is no-
where to be found.  According to a response by the California Department of Insur-
ance to an inquiry by PlainSite, “Regulations allow an insurer with no credible data to 
use the rating factors and relativities from another insurer’s approved class plan.  Thus, 
we approved the auto-discount as it is a ‘me-too’ of Response Indemnity Company’s 
auto-pilot discount (approved in #17-6660) with minor differences.”


China


Tesla’s increasing activity in China presents a new set of risks for the company.  First 
and foremost, executives should be concerned about the Foreign Corrupt Practices 
Act (FCPA) given its essential incompatibility with the traditional Chinese practice 
of Guanxi (闗係).301  It is likely that to accomplish the construction of the Shanghai 
Tesla factory shell in record time—a first for an American corporation—some Party 
officials had to be persuaded that making an exception to long-standing policy was 
the right thing to do.  If such persuasion efforts involved gifts, FCPA liability may have 
attached to any Americans giving them.  The United States Department of Justice has 
been more consistent about enforcing FCPA violations relative to other laws con-
nected to corporate malfeasance.302


China may also pose problems for Tesla due to the company’s growing dependence 
on the government of a foreign nation for financial support.  The United States De-

(CFIUS) could reasonably consider Tesla’s recent 
$1.3 billion loan deal an “other investment” under 
the Foreign Investment Risk Review Moderniza-
tion Act of 2018 (FIRRMA).  If CFIUS chose to 
block the financing arrangement, Tesla would 
need to find an alternative source of funding very 
quickly.  There are plenty of powerful interests in 
the automotive industry who might decide to put 
pressure on CFIUS, formally or through political 
means, to block, or at least examine, the deal—
especially given Donald Trump’s stated animosity 
toward trade with China.


This risk is compounded by a recently published video op-ed by the China Global 
Times, a state-run media organization.303  The video portrays the Tesla factory as a 
symbol of China’s ability to rise above the Trump trade war, and the op-ed looks and 
sounds much like an economic development campaign advertisement with Tesla’s 
factory front and center.  This suggests that the Chinese government has been so 
generous to Elon Musk and Tesla because it perceives enormous propaganda value 
from the arrangement (whether or not that is actually merited).  In the Party’s eyes, 
Musk’s American company is akin to the lone scab willing to cross the picket line.  Ac-
cordingly, if Musk ever has anything negative to say about the Chinese government 
or if the economic pinch of the trade war fades, Tesla may find it much more difficult 
to do business in China as it becomes less useful as a political symbol and more like 
every other foreign company.  Alternatively, if the Chinese government is hoping to 
learn lessons from (or put another way, steal) Tesla’s intellectual property, it may sim-
ply be disappointed as the company owns very little in the way of unique technology.


Ironically, given the human rights abuses that are ongoing in Xinjiang province, where 
the Chinese government has imprisoned millions of Uighur Muslims in concentration 
camps, and in Hong Kong, where violent protests have become the norm, a depen-
dence upon Chinese manufacturing presents public relations challenges for Tesla and 
other companies that choose to continue to do business there, including but certainly 
not limited to Apple and Volkswagen, which has owned a facility in Urumqi, Xinjiang 
for years.304  Historically, German automobile manufacturers were known for their en-
thusiastic willingness to exploit Jewish slave labor in World War II, and it is disappoint-
ing to see any company fall into the same horrific trap, or work with the government 
responsible for setting it in the first place.

Perjury


Although it is selectively enforced, the crime of perjury has come up time and again 
as Tesla has relied on government handouts and battled in the courts.


• In a declaration submitted by Elon Musk in the Unsworth litigation, he claimed, 
“By referring to Mr. Unsworth as ‘pedo guy,’ I did not intend to convey any facts 
or imply that Mr. Unsworth had engaged in acts of pedophilia.”  In fact, Musk paid 
a convicted felon for false information concerning Mr. Unsworth’s non-existent 
“child bride.”  On the same page as this false statement, he also wrote, “I googled 
Chiang Rai and read an article stating that it was a well-known hot spot for child 
prostitution and sex trafficking.”305


• In Elon Musk’s SolarCity deposition, perjury was explicitly raised by plaintiffs’ coun-
sel on pages 164-165 of the June 1, 2019 transcript in the context of Musk’s false 
claim that he expected SolarCity to be cash-flow positive even as it was drown-
ing in debt.  Musk also used the phrase “I don’t recall” at least 65 times.  Musk 
also claimed he believed Tesla’s “growth of megawatts deployed would be very 
significant.”  Then he assigned all of SolarCity’s employees to work on the Model 3.


• Tesla employee Christine Moxley Leslie committed perjury in the Tesla, Inc. v. Ho-
thi retaliation case when she claimed —without being present for the events she 
was describing—that Hothi had sped off from the Fremont factory’s parking lot 
“quickly and recklessly,” directly contradicting a police report based on video of 
the incident that used the phrase “Randeep drove away at a slow rate of speed.”


• Tesla employee Tyler James committed perjury in the same case, having claimed 
that Hothi left “at a fast rate of speed.”


• When Tesla lawyer Al Prescott repeatedly represented to NHTSA that all of the 
information Tesla sought to keep secret was “confidential and proprietary,” each 
declaration was made under penalty of perjury —even when circumstances of 
collisions involving Tesla vehicles had often been written up in newspapers, mak-
ing them public.


• Mark Olson, Tesla Senior Director, U.S. Tax, submitted false and incomplete ap-
plication materials to CAEATFA under penalty of perjury when he responded 
“None” to a question that required him to “Disclose any legal or regulatory action 
or investigation that may have a material impact on the financial viability of the 
project or the Applicant.”  He attached a copy of Tesla’s 2018 SEC Form 10-K in 
response to the next question requiring that he “Disclose any legal or regulatory 
action or investigation involving fraud or corruption, or health and safety where 
there are allegations of serious harm to employees, the public, or the environ-
ment.”  On page 133, Tesla’s 2018 SEC Form 10-K only mentions “various other

legal proceedings and claims that arise from the normal course of business activi-
ties,” and provides no details about the 51 lawsuits that had been filed against it at 
the time involving Tesla workers.  Nor did Olson update CAEATFA, as required, 
with news of the 29 subsequent lawsuits filed involving Tesla workers throughout 
the rest of 2019, or the billion-dollar write-off in New York for a similar program.


• When Tesla applied to start a regulated insurance company with the Califor-
nia Department of Insurance, under penalty of perjury an unknown employee 
answered “Has the business entity or any of its partners, members, controlling 
persons, officers, directors, managers or any shareholders owning 10% or more 
interest in the business entity, ever been notified by any jurisdiction to which you 
are applying of any delinquent tax obligation that is not the subject of a repay-
ment agreement?” by checking “No.”  Tesla was sued for failing to pay taxes in 
Orange County, California on March 10, 2017.306


• On the same California Department of Insurance application, under penalty of 
perjury an unknown employee answered, “Has the business entity or any of its 
partners, members, controlling persons, officers, directors, managers or any share-
holders owning 10% or more interest in the business entity, a party to, or ever 
been found liable in any lawsuit or arbitration proceeding involving allegations of 
fraud, misappropriation or conversion of funds, misrepresentation or breach of 
fiduciary duty?” by checking “No.”  Elon Musk and Tesla, Inc. were sued for securi-
ties fraud by the Securities and Exchange Commission and settled the case, after 
which Musk was charged with contempt of court 
for violating the agreement.  Separately, Musk 
admitted that he concocted a “bait and switch” 
scheme involving Roadster deposits, and Kimbal 
Musk admitted that Elon had misappropriated 
Roadster deposit funds.

table public failures.  The bill passed the House of Representatives,309 and a congres-
sional report, as well as a Department of Energy Inspector General report,310 dug into 
the various causes of Solyndra’s failure.  Unfortunately, relatively few lessons were ac-
tually learned.  Congress’s decision to grant Tesla customers tax breaks, however well 
intentioned, had the side-effect of rewarding reprehensible corporate behavior.  The 
closest Congress has come to a hearing on Tesla or Elon Musk’s antics in securities 
markets (or otherwise) is a few minutes at a Senate Commerce Committee hearing 
where Autopilot defeat devices appeared to give Senator Markey of Massachusetts 
cause for alarm.


National Highway Traffic Safety Administration


Even after the European Union effectively banned Autopilot, and even having received 
several e-mails about problems with Autopilot from concerned citizens, the NHTSA 
has taken virtually no action to safeguard the public.  This is possibly because the 
Department of Transportation under Donald Trump has deliberately taken a stance 
of allowing industry “self-regulation.”  In a brochure from September 2017 entitled, 
“Automated Driving Systems 2.0: A Vision for Safety,” the NHTSA stated “[T]o save 
lives, prevent injuries, and reduce the economic costs of roadway crashes through 
education, research, safety standards, and enforcement activity...NHTSA offers a non-
regulatory approach to automated vehicle technology.”311  The brochure’s main sec-
tions are “Voluntary Guidance,” ending with “Voluntary Safety Self-Assessment,” and 
then “Technical Assistance to States,” followed by a conclusion.  The brochure needs 
little translation: NHTSA’s plan is to do as little as possible.


Even obtaining information from NHTSA has been unusually difficult.  FOIA requests 
have proceeded at a snail’s pace, and it has been difficult not to conclude that the 
Administration is deliberately obstructing inquiries.  In response to a question about 
why a valid telephone number is not contained in NHTSA letters sent in response 
to FOIA requests, a spokeswoman answered, “’Cause they’re…they just not gonna 
do that.”


NHTSA’s disinterest was readily apparent when Acting Administrator James C. Ow-
ens, a career bureaucrat and lawyer, appeared before the Senate Commerce Com-
mittee for a hearing on November 20, 2019 completely unprepared to answer ques-
tions involving automated vehicles.312  He replaced Acting Administrator Heidi King, 
a regulatory economist who had worked for the Obama White House as an analyst 
from 2007-2011, who resigned on August 31, 2019.

98Reality Check


United States Securities and Exchange Commission


Under the leadership of former securities lawyer Jay Clayton (whose past clients 
include notorious corporate actors such as Valeant Pharmaceuticals, Deutsche Bank 


and The Weinstein Company) the 
United States Securities and Ex-
change Commission has behaved 
in a more spineless manner than 
at any point since the Enron cri-
sis in 2002.  With the enthusiastic 
assistance of Commissioner Hes-
ter Peirce, Clayton has set about 
dismantling the Commission from 
within, ensuring that it does not get 
in the way of corporate criminals 
who seek to exploit capital mar-
kets for their own personal gain.


Although the SEC filed suit against 
Elon Musk personally and Tesla, 
Inc. after the August 2018 “fund-
ing secured” incident, Musk was let 
off with an incredibly light slap on 
the wrist given that he had com-
mitted the most flagrant abuse of 
securities law in the stock market’s 
history.  At a minimum, the Com-
mission should have barred Musk 
from serving as an officer or direc-
tor of any publicly traded company 
for the rest of his life.  Instead, the 
SEC caved.


Then, when Musk deliberately violated his Consent Decree using the defense that 
he had First Amendment rights (obviously limited by the Consent Decree) and that 
he could “pre-approve” his own posts on Twitter, the Commission again flubbed its 
offensive and backed off.  Since then, it has taken no action despite Musk’s persistent 
and often gleeful violations of the amended Consent Decree.


The SEC’s utter depravity was made apparent in a comment letter submitted to the 
Commission by an anonymous individual posing as “Felon Musk.”  Although the SEC 
initially posted the letter in its entirety, it later redacted the pseudonym.


Some sense of dysfunction must have been felt within the Commission, because

by mid-2019 the three SEC trial attorneys initially assigned to Musk’s case had all 
departed.  Jina Choi, the veteran Regional Director of the San Francisco office, left 
for law firm Morrison & Foerster.  E. Barrett Atwood left to become the Director of 
Litigation for Lyft.  And Cheryl Crumpton joined Exelon Corporation within weeks 
after speaking directly to Elon Musk about the violations of his Consent Decree.  The 
SEC Inspector General should ask why.


Federal Trade Commission


Despite open talk of “money printers,” brazenly misleading pricing, widespread use 
of diesel generators, a direct referral from NHTSA and other FTC Act violations 
galore, the Federal Trade Commission has been completely silent on Tesla while it 
has pursued other companies engaged in far less wide-reaching violations of law.  The 
FTC also has jurisdiction over marketing tactics by social media influencers, which 
despite some overlap with securities law violations in this case (since many of Tesla’s 
Greek chorus members frequently recommend that viewers purchase stock without 
disclosing their own ownership and company ties), are in desperate need of a strong 
regulatory framework.


United States Department of Justice


The United States Department of Justice has been investigating Tesla since 2017 
based on questionable claims made about its Model 3 manufacturing capa-
bilities, but nothing has come out of that investigation thus far.  It is possible that 
the Department is waiting on the outcome of an appeal before the Ninth Cir-
cuit in the case of Wochos v. Tesla, which addresses overlapping issues.  Oral ar-
gument in that case should take place sometime from February to April 2020.313 
 
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), which is a bureau of the Department, may 
also have ongoing investigations that are unrelated to the Model 3 manufacturing 
issue.  The FBI previously investigated SolarCity for overly aggressive sales tactics.314


State and Local Governments


The State of New York and the State of California have both proven to be no match 
for Elon Musk’s charm and wit.  With New York investing—and losing—$1 billion, and 
California handing over about $270 million to someone already incredibly wealthy, 
it’s hard to imagine how a scrappy entrepreneur with a legitimate idea in the clean 
energy space could be expected to compete.  To date, no public audits of either 
state’s giveaways have been released.  California State Senator Scott Wiener did not

respond to a detailed letter expressing concern about CAEATFA.


Similarly, Storey County, Nevada local and state government officials have been far 
too eager to please Tesla thanks to its capacity for job creation.  When a United States 
Department of Labor Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) official 
arrived at Tesla’s Nevada factory with a warrant signed by a judge, the Storey County 
Sheriff ’s Office refused to let him enter at Tesla’s request.  When governments work 
for, rather than watch over, corporate interests, society itself is at risk.


Conclusion
At this point in his career, absolutely nothing Elon Musk says can be trusted.  As in-
vestors in Enron, Worldcom, MiMedx, and similarly fraudulent companies run by con 
men can attest, the value of a company which has never turned a sustained profit, 
which has serious accounting irregularities, which has already signed a binding consent 
decree with regulators concerning unprecedented securities fraud, which relies on 
criminals for stealth marketing, which burns through executives literally on a monthly 
basis, which buys products from itself to placate Wall Street, and which is run by 
someone whose word is fundamentally worthless, is precisely that: zero.


In his zeal to keep Tesla afloat, Elon Musk has repeatedly committed criminal acts with 
the same nonchalant ignorance that allowed him to falsely proclaim that he had found 
a cure for autism in an untested, still-theoretical microchip.  The company’s perpetu-
ally precarious financial position—propped up by taxpayers, investors and pre-paid 
deposits for nearly two full decades—has resulted in a dynamic that resembles a 
Madoff-scale Ponzi scheme far more than a real corporation.  Though Tesla’s prod-
ucts have at times been quite innovative (and the company has over the course of 
nearly seventeen years employed many brilliant engineers), they also have suffered 
from serious design defects that have cost real lives.  Musk, always the master of 
distraction with his quirky humor and big ideas, has done an impressive job keeping 
the mainstream press’s attention far from the company’s core problems.  But at the 
end of the day, Tesla does not have a future as an independent, profitable company.  
Its competitive advantage as the first mover in the electric vehicle market has all but 
eroded, which in a best-case scenario will very likely leave it in the same place as 
other once-powerful first movers such as Friendster, IBM, Polaroid, and Napster, which 
is to say, nowhere.


But more likely, if a Democrat is elected to the White House in 2020, Tesla will one 
day go bankrupt, and Elon Musk will go to prison along with the many executives who 
could not find the courage to say “no.”
