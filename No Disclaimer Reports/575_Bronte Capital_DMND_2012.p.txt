Diamond foods - what the press releases says and does not
say...
Diamond Foods is a short-battle-ground stock. Anyone who looks at Herb Greenberg's twitter feed
can see that. Herb loves battlegrounds. 
 
Today the company made a repetitive press release that has me reading between the lines. Here is
the guts of the release: 
 
 


[The company] today announced that the Audit Committee of its Board of Directors has
substantially completed its investigation of the Company's accounting for certain crop
payments to walnut growers. The Audit Committee has concluded that the Company's
financial statements for the fiscal years 2010 and 2011 will need to be restated. Over
the course of the last three months, the Audit Committee has carefully reviewed the
accounting treatment of certain payments to walnut growers.  The Audit Committee has
concluded that a "continuity" payment made to growers in August 2010 of
approximately $20 million and a "momentum" payment made to growers in September
2011 of approximately $60 million were not accounted for in the correct periods, and
 the Audit Committee identified material weaknesses in the Company's internal control
over financial reporting. 


The Board of Directors is taking a number of corrective actions including the
appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer.  Effective
immediately, the Board has appointed Director Rick Wolford to serve as Acting
President and Chief Executive Officer and Michael Murphy, of Alix Partners, LLP, to
serve as Acting Chief Financial Officer. The Company is commencing searches for
permanent replacements for the CEO and CFO positions.  The Board has also
appointed Robert J. Zollars, who previously served as Lead Independent Director, to the
position of Chairman of the Board. Michael J. Mendes and Steven M. Neil have been
placed on administrative leave from the Company.


I have read the whole release - but there is no additional information. 
 
I know relatively little about this company - indeed I did not bother looking because the short was
crowded and the product (Kettle chips and walnuts) seemed OK. But this release had me puzzled. 
 
The offence as described - moving $20 million of expense from one year to another in one year and
$60 million in another year seems relatively minor. But the sacking of the CEO and CFO and the
appointment of Alix Partners seemed less minor. 
 
Still timing offences (and they admit timing offences) must be measured relative to earnings. 
 
The last 10K (since amended and now withdrawn) shows nicely growing income in excess of $50
million.

5/18/2018 Bronte Capital: Diamond foods - what the press releases says and does not say...


http://brontecapital.blogspot.com/2012/02/diamond-foods-what-press-releases-says.html 2/5


 
 
$26 million in net income and about $50 million in the next year. If you were to add $20 million of
expense to 2010 and $40 million (the net amount moved) to 2011 and tax-effect those amounts the
profits drop from a net $26 million to $14 million for 2010 and $50 million to $22 million for 2011. 
 
That is pretty nasty. But not terminal. Still there are 21 million shares outstanding and at the after-
market price ($21 down 42 percent) that is still 20 times earnings. 
 
It does not look like a salivating buy at 20 times. Not close. 
 
And the loss of the CEO and CFO does matter. There is seldom only one cockroach. 
 
The thing that gets me though is the appointment of the new CFO. Michael Murphy is from Alix
Partners and his CV makes it very clear that he specializes in restructuring debt. Alix do a lot of
bankruptcy work (though that is not the only thing they do). 
 
The last balance sheet (also since withdrawn) is amusing. 
 


 
 
 
It shows cash of just over $3 million, some short term debt and long term obligations of nearly half a
billion dollars. And - given the restatement - we can guess this thing only earns just over $20 million a
year - and even that presumes the absence of further cockroaches. 
 
I shorted some in the after-market. Don't do that often - but am quite pleased with myself.
