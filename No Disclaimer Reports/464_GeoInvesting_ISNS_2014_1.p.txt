Image Sensing Systems
(ISNS) – Buyer Beware,
ISNS Has Nothing To Do
With Body-Worn Cameras
September 3, 2014 By GeoTeam


Summary


Image Sensing Systems’ (ISNS) meteoric rise on the
heels of DGLY is totally unwarranted. INSY does not
sell ANY body-worn cameras, a fact we confirmed
after contacting its personnel.
Managers of a special situation fund that disclosed
ownership of 859,646 ISNS shares in July 2014 may
agree with our conclusion, recently liquidating 57% of
the fund’s position. (source 3).
ISNS’s recent financial growth has been unexciting
and the company is expected to lose money both in
2015, and for the next six quarters. (source 1).
Shares of Vicon Industries, Inc. (VII) have also been
riding the Digital Ally, Inc. (DGLY) hype. We also
confirmed they have nothing to do with body-worn
cameras.
We think it is only a matter of time before investors
send ISNS shares back to earth, and we caution that
we believe there will be bag holders.


Unfortunately, many investors are rallying shares of ISNS
as a play related to DGLY and GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO).
Both of these companies make body-worn camera/video
products that have been pushed into the spotlight due to
recent police conflicts with public protesters.

5/23/2018 Image Sensing Systems (ISNS) - Buyer Beware, ISNS Has Nothing To Do With Body-Worn Cameras | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/buyer-beware-image-sensing-systems-has-nothing-to-do-with-body-worn-cameras/ 2/14


Wearable video cameras for police officers, serving a
similar function to that of dashboard cameras, are
becoming more commonplace and potentially an industry
standard.. For this reason, DGLY is aggressively targeting
law enforcement agencies as potential customers of the
company’s products.


But there is one problem: ISNS’s product line is totally
different than DGLY’s and has nothing to do with the body-
worn camera/video products that capture live action. The
company does absolutely nothing in the new
innovative body-worn camera market segment. We
contacted the company to confirm this fact and we
suggest investors do the same. The company’s products
are largely geared towards reading licensing plates for data
analysis, traffic management, and parking solutions.


DGLY reported reduced sales and significant losses for its
Q1 & Q2 (source 4), as budgetary issues at law
enforcement agencies are partly to blame for these poor
results (source 6). ISNS is also plagued by this issue and
since it can be argued that license plate recognition (“LPR”)
products infringe on rights to privacy (as opposed to DGLY
products that can protect citizen’s rights), law enforcement
will be more inclined to loosen the purse strings for DGLY
products. In its SEC filings, ISNS discusses the “risk and
the negative impacts” these factors are having on its sales.
We can add to these observations that ISNS is losing
money, has not meaningfully grown its sales in three years,
has been missing analyst estimates, is expected to
continue to post losses in 2015 and has limited visibility
into future financial performance.


On a side note, shares of Vicon Industries, Inc.
(NYSEMKT:VII) have more than doubled in recent days
amid the Digital Ally, Inc. (NASDAQ:DGLY) hype. We e-
mailed the company who told us they “do not
manufacture cameras worn on the person” and that

they have “no plans that [they] are aware of” to do
so in the future. VII is losing money and its revenue has
been in falling sharply since 2007 (source 5).


We believe it’s just a matter of time before the momentum
investors who have no clue what ISNS and VII actually do
will run for the exits.


So, why have ISNS shares risen over 125% in the last 3
months alone and why should they retrace a good deal of
this move?


What’s All the Hype About?


The initial public offering of GPRO in June 2014 is one of
the reasons we published a bullish article on Voxx
International (NASDAQ:VOXX) on July 30, 2014 which has
introduced its own body-worn camera to compete with
GPRO.


“Under-the-radar catalysts in fiscal Q3 2015, when VOXX
launches its 360Fly, a 360-degree panoramic video camera
(“action cameras”), which has been described
internationally online as not only a threat to GoPro, but
possibly a GoPro killer. The product has received rave
reviews at CES.”


The August 9, 2014 police shooting death of Michael Brown
in Ferguson Missouri has added considerable attention to
the body-worn camera/video sector.


The performance of DGLY over the past several days
continues to highlight the excitement investors have over
the body-worn device sector. As a product of this
excitement, shares have risen over 700%, since the
Michael Brown incident. DGLY makes body-worn
camera/video products that it sells to law enforcement
agencies and other security organizations, as well as to

consumer and commercial fleet operators through direct
sales and third-party distributors.


DGLY management has secured some key contacts and
provided bullish guidance for 2014. Here is a quote from an
August 29, 2014 8-K:


“In an article in USA Today on August 28, 2014,
Stanton E. Ross, Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of Digital Ally, Inc. (the
“Company”) was quoted as stating that the
Company’s revenues in fiscal 2014 will approach
$22.5 million. Mr. Ross made such forecast based
on current and expected level of future activity
and other information currently available. He
stated that inquiries from potential customers
regarding the Company’s audio/video
surveillance products had increased
approximately fivefold in the period immediately
following the events in Ferguson, MO.”


This guidance, combined with the “hype” has helped push
the stock to the highs that investors are currently enjoying.


Special Situation Fund Exits More
Than Half its Position


If investors don’t want to heed our warning they may want
to consider that Austin W. Marxe and David M. Greenhouse
(collectively AD), managers of several special situation
funds, have used the move higher in ISNS to begin
dumping ISNS shares held in some of their funds.


On July 9, 2014 a 13G was flied disclosing that three AD
funds owned 859,646 shares of ISNS, or a 17.3%
ownership interest. Now, just about two months later, a
form 4 filed on August 28, 2014 shows that AD has

https://geoinvesting.com/buyer-beware-image-sensing-systems-has-nothing-to-do-with-body-worn-cameras/ 5/14


liquidated 488,892 of these shares. We don’t think many
investors are aware of this event, since form 4 filings are
not shown as a default view at SEC.gov. In essence, these
major inside holders seem to think that this run up in ISNS
stock is a good enough impetus to sell, and they are
offloading their shares onto the public at what we believe
to be inflated prices.


The ISNS Party Should Not Last


Investors seem to be latching onto shares of any company
that sells security products, even though they have nothing
to do with the DGLY hype based around wearables.


The genesis of ISNS’s product line-up centers around traffic
management and License Plate Recognition applications,
not around taking live action video or pictures of officers in
the line of duty. Here is the company’s product list from its
web site:


“Traffic Management: Overwhelming road
traffic and its attendant problems are among
every city’s most challenging issues. To move
traffic safely and efficiently, you need a
company that’s out front, accelerating toward
more effective ITS solutions. That’s Image
Sensing Systems.


Crime: Image Sensing Systems offers you the
most sophisticated above-ground fixed and
mobile cameras, capable of reading hundreds
of plates simultaneously and, in some cases,
capturing details like the vehicle’s make, model
and color. CitySync Safety is an innovative LPR
back office system. CitySync Mobile is a turn-key,
automated license plate recognition (LPR) for
police departments.

Parking: Our above-ground Autoscope cameras
coupled with our back office software solutions
give you a clear-eyed look at all the goings-on at
your facility.


Security: Our high-fidelity above-ground
cameras capture license plate numbers while
working seamlessly with our back office analytics.
Data is superbly managed and analyzed. Access
is automated. Vehicle images are logged.
Frequent visitors are tagged. Vehicles of interest
trigger alarms. Text alerts can be sent. And
that’s just the beginning.”


The company does absolutely
nothing in the new innovative
body-worn camera market
segment.


As The Street said (source 7):


“The shooting sparked weeks of protests and civil
unrest. More than 147,000 citizens have signed a
White House petition to demand legislation that
would require state, county and local police to
wear cameras while on duty.”


The appeal of some of DLGY’s law enforcement body-worn
products is that action is recorded once police officers exit
their vehicles making them accountable for their actions.
ISNS’s crime/police product is more like a standalone “Big
Brother is watching you product,” with the purpose of
reading license plates for data aggregation and analysis.
While useful, it is certainly not the new “sexy” explosive
growth story DGLY is pitching. We believe this to be an

extremely important distinction that investors need to wrap
their heads around.


What that Street story didn’t mention, interestingly
enough, was peoples’ views towards license plate
identification activities. We would bet that the majority of
people would be opposed to broad types of surveillance,
versus the personalized accountability that comes with
individual police cameras. We believe this to be the tulip
mania craze all over again.


Many citizens oppose Big Brother spy tactics, but would
welcome a product where law enforcement is seemingly
held in check. In a time where budgets are tight,
government agencies need to consider this reality when
doling out money for law enforcement products.


In fact, ISNS acknowledges this risk factor in its 10-K for
the period ended December 31, 2013.


“The use of video and LPR products and systems
has been challenged, limited and banned under
existing laws, ordinances and regulations and
constitutional provisions protecting privacy
rights. In addition, governments and
governmental agencies have stopped or
suspended their use of LPR systems. For
example, Maine, New Jersey and Virginia
have laws limiting the use of LPR systems; New
Hampshire bans their use; legislation has been
proposed in Minnesota limiting the use of data
collected by LPR systems; and the Boston
Police Department has indefinitely halted its
use of LPR systems. In addition, laws,
ordinances, regulations and constitutional
provisions may be adopted in the future to limit
the use of video and LPR products and systems.
These existing and new laws, ordinances,

regulations and constitutional provisions could
negatively affect the acceptance and sale of our
video and LPR products and systems and thus
have a negative effect on our financial condition
and results of operations.”


We don’t know when the party is going is to end, but
once investors realize that they are not getting
anything remotely close to DGLY by owning ISNS, we
believe they may run for the exits.


Investigation Matter


Additionally, in Note 15 of ISNS’s 2013 10-K filing (source
2), the company disclosed a Polish investigation into the
its’s subsidiary. The investigation is a result of alleged
violations of Polish law involving tender and corruption
relating to a project in Lodz.


“As previously disclosed, Polish authorities are
conducting an investigation into violations of
Polish law related to tenders in the City of Łodź,
Poland. In December 2012, the regional
prosecutor charged two employees of Image
Sensing Systems Europe Limited SP.Z.O.O., our
Polish subsidiary (“ISS Poland”), with, among
other things, criminal violations of Polish tender
and corruption law related to a project in Łodź.
Neither the Company nor any of our subsidiaries
has been charged with any offense. A Special
Subcommittee of our Audit Committee comprised
solely of independent directors has retained
independent counsel and accounting advisors to
conduct an investigation focusing on possible
violations of Company policy, internal controls,
and laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act, the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and Polish law. This

investigation is ongoing, and we have voluntarily
disclosed this matter to the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Department of
Justice.


We are cooperating with the Polish prosecutor and intend
to cooperate with any other governmental investigation
into these matters. We have taken remedial actions,
including ending the employment of the two Polish
employees, and we are assessing and implementing
enhancements to our internal policies, procedures and
controls. We cannot predict the outcome of this matter at
this time or whether it will have a material adverse impact
on our business prospects, financial condition, operating
results or cash flows.”


The company spent $3.7 million on this expense in 2013
and gives itself a pat on the back saying they’ve
“voluntarily disclosed” this matter. We believe anything
costing a company of this size $3.7M annually is material
enough to have been disclosed in the first place.


Further, the company goes on to comment that it is unsure
of how much money this matter could cost them in the
future:


“General and administrative expense increased to
$6.3 million or 23.9% of total revenue in 2013,
from $5.2 million or 20.7% of total revenue in
2012. General and administrative expenses
increased in 2013 mainly as a result of legal and
other professional fees related to the
investigation and remediation actions described
in Note 15 of our Notes to Consolidated Financial
Statements set forth elsewhere in this Annual
Report on Form 10-K and severance costs related
to the separation from former employees. Our

direct costs related to the investigation were
approximately $3.7 million for the year ended
December 31, 2013 and immaterial in 2012. We
are unable to determine the likely outcome
or range of loss, if any, from the
investigation, or predict with certainty the
timeline for resolution of the investigation.
We anticipate that annual general and
administrative expenses will decrease as a
percentage of revenue in 2014 as compared to
2013.”


We’re sure that these risks, buried deep in the 10-K, are
cloaked behind the hype of the stock’s recent run. Paying
up for a stock with this type of uncertainty is a risky
proposition.


ISNS Near-Term Growth Outlook


ISNS experienced respectable growth in sales between
2003 and 2010. Since 2010, sales growth has been
anemic, culminating in a non-GAAP loss of $10.4 million in
2013. Losses have continued into 2014.

company will still lose money to the tune of $0.69 per
share (source 1). Investors with expectations that ISNS
will easily meet analysts’ estimates and that it is in a
position to experience operational consistently may be
taking a leap of faith.


Additionally, ISNS missed Q1 and Q2 2014 EPS estimates
by a large margin (source 1):


Earnings History Sep 13 Dec 13 Mar 14 Jun 14


EPS Estimate (0.08) (0.19) (0.22) (0.05)


EPS Actual (0.21) (1.95) (0.56) (0.22)


Missed By 0.13 1.76 0.34 0.17


The following commentary from the company’s 2013 10K
filing highlights the difficulty in blindly assuming that ISNS
is in position to report consistent growth sales and
earnings:


“Because the majority of our end users are
governmental entities, we are faced with
challenges related to potential delays in purchase
decisions by those entities and changes in
budgetary constraints. These contingencies could
result in significant fluctuations in our revenue
between periods. The ongoing difficult economic
environment in Europe and the United States is
further adding to the unpredictability of purchase
decisions, creating more delays than usual and
decreasing governmental budgets, and it is
likely to continue to negatively affect our
revenue.“

Conclusion


To be fair, we don’t think ISNS is touting itself as a body-
worn camera player to begin with, it is the misinformed
investors that have enabled this story to spiral out of
control. We would not be surprised if the company issued a
press release specifically stating that it has no ties to the
body-worn camera industry in order to try and restore
some normalcy to its trading.


We believe that once the hype over DGLY subsides,
investors in ISNS will quickly come to the harsh reality that
they are buying this stock for all the wrong reasons.
Finally, we think a large “in the know” institutional player
has taken advantage of this unique information arbitrage
opportunity to lock in profits before the market comes to
the same conclusion that we have.
