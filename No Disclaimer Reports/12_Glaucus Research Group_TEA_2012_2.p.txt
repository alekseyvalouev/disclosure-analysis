THIS RESEARCH REPORT EXPRESSES SOLELY OUR OPINIONS. Use Glaucus Research Group California, LLC’s research opinions at your own risk. You should do your 
own research and due diligence before making any investment decision with respect to securities covered herein. We are short Teavana and therefore stand to realize 
significant gains in the event that the price of stock declines. We do not express any opinion as to whether any of the food products discussed herein are safe for human 
consumption.  Laboratory test results are presented as is, without any warranty of any kind (whether express or implied) and are not intended to form the basis for any 
scientific conclusions or any claims regarding the health effects of the tested products.  Please refer to our full disclaimer at the end of this report.


As consumers of Teavana’s (“Teavana” or the “Company”) high-priced loose leafed teas, we decided to investigate the 
Company’s claims that its teas are pesticide free, so we sent some of Teavana’s most popular teas to an accredited and 
independent lab for testing. 


On November 20, 2012, we released our findings, available here, in which we opined that independent laboratory tests 
showed that Teavana’s teas contain pesticides in amounts that exceed US and EU regulatory limits. 


We surmised that Teavana also deceived Starbucks, its prospective acquirer, regarding the quality of its teas and that 
Starbucks would therefore likely walk away from the deal. In this follow up report, we provide further analysis on the 
Company (and its response to our opinion piece) and include a detailed description of our testing methodology in the hope 
that investors and consumers will perform their own pesticide tests on Teavana’s teas.


BUILT TO LAST?


Teavana’s brand is built on the perception that Teavana’s teas are healthier than other teas because they are pesticide free.  


We placed 80 phone calls to Teavana retail stores in 19 states and to its toll free customer support line inquiring about the
health qualities of the Company’s teas.  In 98% of the phone calls we placed, Teavana’s salespersons declared without 
qualification that the Company’s teas were pesticide free.  In addition, the majority (55%) of the Teavana’s salespersons 
we called also stated that all of the Company’s teas were either certified USDA or European organic.  Watch our video 
(available here) for recordings of some of the phone calls.  


Contrary to the Company’s claims, 100% of the tea samples contained pesticides, many of which are classified by the 


EPA as Possible Human Carcinogens. One of Teavana’s most popular and expensive teas, Monkey Picked Oolong, was 
the most contaminated with 23 pesticides. 


After we published our short thesis on Teavana, the Company issued a weak refutation and took a number of “defensive” 
actions that, in our view, strongly support the accuracy of our opinions.


“Mass advertising can help build brands, but authenticity is what makes them last. If people believe they share values with a 


company, they will stay loyal to the brand.” – Howard Schultz (Chairman & CEO, Starbucks)

1. Lawyers before Customers


Shortly after publication of our report, Teavana issued a press release (available here) more notable for 
what the Company did not say.  In the following chart, we compare what the Company said in its press 
release to the questions that it should have answered in order to truly refute our report.  


Teavana’s press release clearly implies that its teas meet EU pesticide standards.  Yet 77% of the pure 
teas we tested failed such EU tests.  Teavana salespeople continue to tell customers that its teas meet EU 
standards, meaning that in our opinion material misrepresentations continue to occur at the point of sale.  


Teavana has also failed to address another significant finding: that its teas contain pesticides for which no 
tolerance level has been established by the EPA, meaning such teas are technically ‘adulterated’ under 
FDA regulations.  US law prohibits businesses from selling adulterated food products.  By knowingly 
selling adulterated teas, Teavana and its officers and directors risk civil and criminal liability.    


Teavana could put this controversy behind them if the Company stated simply that held to its previous 


claim that its teas do not contain pesticides and released the test results for the products that we 
sampled.  Instead, the Company seemed to shift responsibility for testing its products to third parties and 
issued a lawyerly and evasive statement even though the Company owes it to every customer who 
purchased its products to be forthright and honest about the pesticide content of its teas.  


Teavana's Response What They Didn't Say


Teavana's teas undergo rigorous third-party 


testing on each batch of teas based on 


international food safety standards including 


European Union regulations, which are widely 


considered to be the most stringent in the world.


Just because each batch of tea is tested does not mean that each batch 


of tea passes EU pesticide tests.  Teavana's answer seems deceptive and 


lawyerly.  Teavana should simply tell its customers whether its teas pass 


EU tests and whether they contain pesticides for which no tolerance has 


been established by US regulators. 


Consistent with that, Teavana has established 


internal procedures and comprehensive third 


party testing to ensure all tea is safe and within 


those guidelines.


Teavana's statement is evasive.  It should come clean: if the Company 


tests each batch of tea for pesticides (as it claims in its SEC filings), it 


should state clearly whether it rejects  batches of tea that fail EU and US 


pesticide standards.  If it does not reject such teas, what is the point of 


telling customers that the Company conducts such tests, other than to 


give customers a false sense of security? 


Teavana refutes the report's conclusions. 
Teavana carefully refutes our conclusions but never refutes our 


evidence or test results .


The group that published the report is a short-


seller and may benefit financially from the 


allegations in the report.


We admit up front that we are biased and do not dispute we will make 


money if the price of Teavana's stock goes down.  But that does not 


mean we are wrong.  Teavana has built a billion-dollar business off of 


selling customers expensive teas on the grounds that its products are 


pesticide free.  They are just as biased as we are.

2. New Sales Pitch


Since our report released one week ago, Teavana appears to have changed its sales pitch to customers, 
suggesting that our findings were dead on and that Starbucks should consider the Company’s growth 


trajectory based on Teavana’s new brand image.  


First, Teavana appears to be distancing itself from any claims that its teas are organic.  Teavana 
removed the FAQ from its website entitled “what is the process for making Organic Teas.”  Before we 
made our findings publicly available, Teavana’s website contained the following disclosure, which we 
captured in Google cache (available here):


What is the process for making Organic teas?


Organic tea is grown according to standards set by certified organic programs. 
Farmers produce their crops without using most conventional pesticides, 
fertilizers made with synthetic ingredients, bioengineering, or ionizing radiation. 
Farmers emphasize the conservation of soil and water to enhance environmental 
quality for future generations.


We believe it is significant that the Company took down this section of its website, given that the majority 
of sales representatives that we called misrepresented to us that all of Teavana’s teas were either USDA 
or EU organic.  


Second, Teavana has apparently encouraged its salespeople to change their pitch on pesticides in the 
Company’s products.  We called and visited a few Teavana locations over Black Friday weekend to hear 
whether the Company’s sales tactics have changed.  Indeed they have.  While several Teavana sales 


representatives now admit that while the Company’s teas contain trace amounts of pesticides, they do 
not believe that such pesticides are used directly on the tea leaves.  


Rather, two Teavana salespeople suggested that the pesticides could originate from the ground water, the 
rain or even the dirty hands of agricultural workers picking the tea leaves.   This explanation sounds 
laughably stupid.  Would customers be happier that a tea contains traces of 23 pesticides because 
agricultural workers in China did not wash their hands before picking the tea?  That sounds disgusting.  


In our opinion, this apparent change in sales tactics is a tacit admission that Teavana has been lying to 
customers.  In October 2012, we called 80 stores and 78 of them told us unequivocally that its teas are 
pesticide free.  After we released our report, certain Teavana salespeople now admit there may be 
pesticides in teas but dispute the source of such chemicals.  We suspect that customers, the FTC and 
plaintiffs attorneys may take note that Teavana has apparently changed its tune after getting caught.

We believe that the Company’s new sales pitch perfectly illustrates the difficulties that Teavana will 
have going forward.  Teavana teas are 368% as expensive per ounce as Starbucks Tazo tea, even though 
our tests showed the Tazo teas to contain far fewer pesticides and appear to be much closer to EU 
compliance.  Historically, Teavana has enticed customers to pay a premium price for loose leaf tea by 


telling customers, including our research director, that its teas are pesticide free, EU pesticide 
compliant and organic. 


We believe that the Company will struggle to convince its customers to pay a premium price for teas are 
not pesticide free and that are not organic.  It is a much less attractive sales pitch to admit that the 
Company’s product contains pesticides but that the pesticides only come from the dirty hands of 
agricultural workers or the contaminated the fields in which the tea was grown.  This misses the point: 
customers do not care where the pesticides come from, they only care that the tea contains 


pesticides.  Otherwise, customers might as well flock to a cheaper substitute that is conveniently located 
in a supermarket.  


The alternative is that Teavana completely revamps its supply chain and only sources teas that are truly 
pesticide free.  The problem with that strategy is that cost of goods sold will increase dramatically, which 
can only hurt Teavana’s unit economics (a feature of the business Starbucks found particularly attractive).  


The math is simple: the more Teavana sells, the more tea it must buy.  The more tea Teavana must buy, 
the more likely the Company will have to source from second-rate growers who cut corners or worse, 
shower tea leaves in pesticides.  We think the foundation of the Company’s brand will serve as a straight 
jacket on growth. Teavana sold its growth story on its ability to source high quality pesticide free teas 
and sell them at a premium price – the larger it grows, the harder it gets to meet the Company’s sourcing 
requirements with premium growers, enticing the Company to source tea from growers with lower 
standards. But as soon as customers realize they are paying a premium price for tea containing pesticides 


in excess of EU and US regulatory limits, the brand will suffer and sales will plummet. 


3. Begging the Question – Did Teavana Already Know About Pesticides?


In our report, we released laboratory test results showing that 100% of the tea samples violate U.S. food 
pesticide standards (CFR Title 40 sect 180), meaning they are ‘adulterated’ under the FDCA and subject 
to federal seizure.  We surmised that Teavana would recall its adulterated teas rather than risk the civil 
and criminal liability it may incur by knowingly selling adulterated products over Black Friday weekend.  


Yet it appears that Teavana continues to sell many of the Company’s most contaminated teas, including 
Monkey Picked Oolong (the teas are still available and in stock on the Company’s website). 


This begs the question: did Teavana know before our report that its teas contained pesticides in excess of 
EU and US regulatory limits? If not, then the Company could have pulled violative products and avoid 
liability that may attach for knowingly selling adulterated products under US law.  


We may never know as Teavana has not released its test results to the public, but if it is the case that the 
Company has known for some time that its teas contained pesticides in amounts in excess of US and EU 
regulatory limits, and has continued to tell its customers that such teas are pesticide free (and in many 
cases that such teas are organic), Teavana’s liability could be much larger than we initially estimated.  


We believe that Starbucks’ management and board of directors have a fiduciary duty to answer these 
questions and to understand whether Teavana has been knowingly selling pesticide laden teas. 


We continue to believe that Teavana’s marketing practices violate the Federal Trade Act and state 
consumer protection laws that prohibit deceptive marketing and that such deceptive sales practices will

likely lead to a consumer-fraud class action lawsuit against the Company as well as FTC and state-level 
enforcement actions.  We also believe that Teavana made false statements in its SEC filings by stating 
that every batch of tea met EU pesticide standards. 


DO YOUR HOMEWORK!


But we do not want investors to merely take our word for it.  We encourage any investor with a 
significant stake (either long or short) in Teavana to test the Company’s teas. Since we published 


our report, some of the largest hedge funds in the world contacted us to get up to speed on pesticide 
testing.  Therefore, in this follow-up piece, we will outline our methodology with respect to laboratory
testing so that investors can determine for themselves whether Teavana has been telling the truth about 
pesticides in its teas.  Such tests cost a few thousand dollars and can be completed in as little as forty-
eight hours.   


Lab Selection


We were amused to read on blogs reporting our findings that certain consumers had purchased home 
pesticide testing kits on amazon.com in order to measure the pesticide content of Teavana’s teas.  
Although we cannot comment on the accuracy or sensitivity of do-it-yourself testing kits, we encourage 
investors to pay for quality and reliability.  


We selected an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited and independent laboratory lab in Germany which is the world 
leader in food, pharmacological and environmental laboratory testing.  While its not necessary to go to the 


best, at a minimum investors should ensure that they test the teas at an ISO/IEC 17025 accredited lab and 
that such lab is sufficiently familiar with EU and US regulatory requirements to determine whether the 
teas meet both jurisdictions’ pesticide standards.  Although we chose to keep the identity of the lab that 
we used confidential, we have included copies of the lab reports at the back of our original report.  
  
We sent our samples to an accredited lab in Germany for testing because Teavana claims its teas are 
tested to European standards. We also encourage any investor testing Teavana’s teas to send the samples 


to a European lab for testing (or the European branch of an accredited American lab), because a European 
lab is the most familiar with the European Union pesticide import standards (EC 396/2005) for dry 
teas.  However, an accredited U.S. lab could quickly determine for Teavana investors that its products are 
adulterated by U.S. regulatory standards.

Sample Selection


We tested thirteen pure teas because pure teas contained sufficient concentration of tea leaves to obtain a 


statistically significant measurement.  We also tested two blended teas, Samurai Chai M/WAC and 
Youthberry, but such tests came back inconclusive because the tea leaves were blended with too many 
fruits, flowers and herbs to actually measure the pesticide content of the tea leaves.  In order to test the 
quality of the tea, we therefore focused on un-blended pure teas and encourage investors to do the same.  


Below is a list of the teas we tested and the results we obtained.


Test Selection


We commissioned a comprehensive test for over 400 pesticides.  Although different labs test for different 


numbers of pesticides, we encourage investors to commission the broadest pesticide screen available.

Our total cost of a comprehensive pesticide test for one tea sample was Euro 325.  For some of our 
samples, we tested the teas for the presence of heavy metals, which costs an additional Euro 120 per 
sample. 


Chain of Custody


We purchased six to eight ounces of thirteen different pure teas, which cost roughly $1,000, from 
three retail stores (NY, IL and CA), including the very same store on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan 
that impressed Starbucks CEO and Chairman Howard Schultz.  


At no time did we take possession of any of the samples.  Instead, we pointed to the teas we wanted and 
had the stores pack and ship the samples in sealed store-bought metal cans directly to an ISO/IEC 17025 


accredited and independent laboratory for testing. 


It is important to note that at no time did our investigators touch or handle the tea samples.  Rather, our 
buyers went to the stores and watched as Teavana employees scooped the loose-leaf tea into airtight
storage tins provided by the store employee.  Teavana employees then placed all the samples in a box, 
which was picked up by UPS directly from the store, which can be scheduled by any person/institution 
that has a UPS account set up at www.ups.com.  At no point did any of our buyers leave the store with the 


tea or handle the tea in any way.  


Analyzing the Results


Investors should ask the lab to determine whether the samples meet EU and US regulatory standards.  


European Union


The EU prescribes limits for pesticide residues under European Commission regulation 396/2005.  
Readers can check the EU limits for dried tea leaves through the EU pesticide limit database, available 
online here.  If pesticides are present in levels above such standards, such tea is banned from sale to 
consumers in the EU.  Our lab was able to determine that contrary to Teavana's representations in its 
SEC filings, 77% of the tea samples failed the European Union pesticide import standards (EC 
396/2005) for dry teas.  


United States


By law, the EPA is responsible for establishing ‘tolerances’ (i.e. maximum safe limits) for each pesticide 
based on the potential risk to human health posed by the chemical. The FDA enforces such tolerances for 
non-poultry/beef products such as tea to ensure that the nation's food supply is maintained safely at all 
times.  


Under Section 402, Title 342(a)(2)(B) and Section 406, Title 346(a)(1) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic
Act (“FDCA”), a processed food or feed is considered to be adulterated and subject to FDA enforcement 
action if it contains pesticide residue for which there is no tolerance, tolerance exemption, or food 
additive regulation.


On the following page, we have included a chart of our test results listing the thirty-seven pesticides that 
our lab found in Teavana’s teas for which no tolerance has been established.  Among the teas we sampled, 


the lab found no fewer than 121 violations of U.S. standards.  As a point of reference, we have indicated 
where such adulterants were found in amounts exceeding the limits prescribed by the European Union.

We encourage customers and investors with a significant stake in Teavana (either long or short) to 
perform their own tests on the Company’s products.  


Teavana’s brand is built on the misperception that its teas are healthy because they are pesticide free.  


This allows the Company to charge customers above-average prices for tea (368% above our 
Starbucks Tazo tea samples).  We believe that as soon as customers discover that they are paying 
premium prices for pesticide-laden teas, Teavana’s brand will be tarnished and its sales will plummet. 


We were naively happy customers of Teavana for two years.  During that time we paid substantially 
more money because we were told the teas were pesticide free and/or organic.  We will never go 
back.  And we suspect that we are not alone.
