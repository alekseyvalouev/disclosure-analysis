Executive Summary

Spruce Point Sees 75% - 90% Downside To 
PetIQ, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETQ)


• Recently-Acquired Services Segment From VIP Will Deliver Slow Sales Growth And Burn Significant Cash: Whereas PetIQ management has publicized its 
new services business as a 25% organic grower, total segment growth was just 9% in FY18, and we estimate that growth from existing stores was just 1-
2%. Management is planning to roll out 1,000 new health and wellness centers in retailers such as Walmart through 2023, and expects each store to offer 
30% contribution margins at maturity, but we estimate that the roll-out could burn $200M of cash through the next five years (perhaps more thereafter) 
while just barely achieving break-even profitability in FY23.


• Suspicious Circumstances Around VIP Acquisition: PetIQ eliminated $111M of inter-company sales in the combined company’s pro forma 2017 income 
statement (over half of PetIQ’s COGS), revealing the closeness of the relationship between PetIQ and VIP. Of the $220M purchase price, $76M was 
allocated to VIP’s “customer relationships” which were written down twice from $90M, suggesting that these relationships were of declining quality or 
were reduced to suppress amortization and cut prospective GAAP losses in half. After the acquisition, over 100% of earnings for the pro forma 2017 
combined company were attributable to vendor rebates, which grew by 175% in the year prior to the deal. We find it suspicious that PetIQ would spend 
$220M on the $250M-revenue VIP business after its EBITDA appears to have declined for two straight quarters and go negative prior to the acquisition.


PetIQ, Inc. (“PetIQ,” “PETQ,” or “the Company”), a recent JOBS Act IPO, is the product of an acquisition of an unattractive veterinary services 
business by a shady veterinary drug distribution business. The distribution business, built on the ethically-nebulous practice of veterinary drug 
diversion into the retail channel, appears to depend heavily on access to vendor rebates for earnings, and is currently at risk to changes in drug 


manufacturers’ approach to retail distribution. PetIQ’s planned rollout of 1,000 new pet wellness centers could also burn over $200M in cash over 
the next five years without even achieving break-even profitability until FY23. The Company has already changed its story and growth targets 
numerous times despite being public for just 20 months, and is not fully transparent about the risks facing both businesses. Management is 


asking investors to trust it to execute despite having missed nearly all prior projections. Further, we find that PetIQ management – whose CEO 
has close ties to the notorious Petters Ponzi scheme and the Fleming Corp accounting fraud (which go undisclosed on his online bio) – has a 


history of engaging in business practices which have come under legal and regulatory scrutiny. Investors should proceed with extreme caution.


• PetIQ Occupies A Murky Space In The Pet Pharmaceuticals Market: PetIQ purchases prescription and OTC veterinary pharmaceuticals from veterinarians 
and licensed distributors. Manufacturers have historically restricted themselves from selling to non-licensed distributors or directly into the retail channel 
in order to protect veterinarians from retail competition for pet medicine sales. However, veterinary drugs do ultimately reach the retail channel – both 
brick-and-mortar and online – through non-veterinarian distributors (such as PetIQ) which purchase excess product from veterinarians, and which often 
form arrangements with veterinarians to purchase inventory in size. While not technically illegal in most states, the practice is frowned upon by vets, and 
has been the subject of congressional hearings and FTC commentary through the last several years. PetIQ’s General Counsel, who presumably blessed its 
business practices – yet whose personal bankruptcy was never disclosed to investors – recently resigned in Mar 2019. Manufacturers are increasingly 
beginning to bypass the grey market and sell directly to retail – as is Merial with its Frontline product, as of FY18 – showing cracks in PetIQ’s economic 
ecosystem. Wider competition in the pet medicine distribution space and greater transparency into distributor margins among retailers could bring PetIQ 
product segment operating margins – 8-9% as of today – closer to the 1-3% margins shown by other pharmaceutical distributors.


• Core Pharmaceutical Distribution Business Is Under Pressure: Consumers are shifting away from topical flea and tick medications (30-40% of PetIQ sales) in 
favor of more dependable and hassle-free oral and other treatments. Frontline, one of PetIQ’s major sellers, is facing pressure from both this and the 
proliferation of cheaper substitutes. Consumers are also reporting that Frontline has become less effective following a recent formula change.

Spruce Point Sees 75% - 90% Downside To 
PetIQ, Inc. (Nasdaq: PETQ)


• Acquisition Driven By Fragile Industry Dynamics: Spruce Point believes that PetIQ was motivated to acquire VIP for more direct access to manufacturer 
relationships and vendor rebates as it outgrew the capacity of its previous vendors. At the time, this arrangement would have been beneficial to Merial as 
well, as it would have allowed Merial to drive retail sales of its pet medications more directly while maintaining the appearance of selling only to vets. 
However, now that Merial has begun selling directly to retail, PetIQ is at risk of seeing its margins regress to those of pharmaceutical distributor peers as 
retailers gain greater visibility into distributor margins and wholesale pricing.


• Poor Earnings Quality With Widening Rift Between GAAP/Non-GAAP Results And Cash Flow: VIP financials suggest that combined-company earnings 
depend heavily on rebates. Management adjustments are responsible for close to half of Adj. EBITDA as of FY18, and these adjustments should increase 
as one-time store opening expenses are added back with the accelerating wellness center build-out. Adj. EBITDA grew by ~100% in FY18 despite OCF –
which has been close to or below zero since the IPO – falling deeply negative.


• A Company With A Dubious Past And A History of Questionable Vendor Arrangements: PetIQ appears to have been born as W.T.F. Wholesale in the early 
2000s. W.T.F. formally closed shop in 2011 – but not before accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of product from veterinary suppliers 
without paying, after which it appears to have continued to do business as “True Lines Distributors,” as alleged in lawsuits. True Lines was a subsidiary of 
“True Science Holdings, LLC,” which became PetIQ in 2016. True Science appears to have formed non-arms-length relationships with veterinary drug 
wholesalers through the first half of the 2010s. A former supplier alleged that, during this period, True Science used these close relationships to 
manufacture artificially inflated assets and earnings. He also alleged that its accounting practices triggered a federal investigation in 2014.


• CEO With A History Tied To Vendor Rebate Schemes: CEO McCord “Cord” Christensen was a major funnel of investor money into the Petters Ponzi 
scheme – a fact which goes unmentioned on his online bio. He was characterized as an unknowing victim in court proceedings, but was closely associated 
with Petters as an employee and business partner through the 2000s, and controlled several entities which recruited millions of dollars of investor money 
for Petters. He was also involved with subsidiaries of Fleming Corp, which was identified as an accounting fraud for inflating earnings through the 
improper application of vendor rebates. The fraud was so egregious that the business was nicknamed “Flem-ron” in the scheme’s fallout.


• Downside Risks To Valuation Abound: We believe that PetIQ earnings are heavily dependent on access to manufacturer rebates. We consider these 
earnings of low quality at best. With Merial now selling Frontline directly to retail, we expect the value of PetIQ’s rebates to dwindle as Merial and larger 
retailers increasingly squeeze its markups. Should regulation surrounding the grey market change – for example, if regulators legitimize the retail channel 
for veterinary drugs – PetIQ could be at risk of disintermediation, and industry legitimization would likely lead to greater industry competition and 
pressure PetIQ’s unusually high margins. We also wonder whether PetIQ’s demonstrated profitability is sustainable given its questionable rebate 
accounting. The possibility of further regulatory investigation into PetIQ’s accounting builds further downside risk into the stock.


• Disappointing Services Growth & Product Segment Margin Contraction Yield Downside To PETQ: We believe that PETQ is set up to disappoint due to sell-
side optimism around sales growth and margin expansion despite headwinds facing its distribution business and poor wellness center economics, and 
despite the fact that product segment gross margins are at risk to changes in animal drug distribution practices. Analysts value PETQ using a multiple 
more than double that of other pharmaceutical distributors due to expectations of strong top-line growth, but we believe that any premium earned by its 
sales growth potential is offset by its poor earnings quality and downside risks to margins. We see 75-90% downside to PETQ on lower-than-expected 
services growth and margin contraction in the products business, as well as on multiple contraction as the market’s understanding of PETQ evolves.

PETQ: Yup, Another Low-Quality JOBS Act IPO


Studies have shown that the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act (JOBS Act) – designed to ease IPO-related disclosure requirements for 
smaller, “Emerging Growth Company” firms – has permitted a growing number low-quality firms to go public. We see PetIQ as yet another low-


quality Company which took advantage of the JOBS Act to go public.

Wellness Center Rollout A Long-Term Drag 
Under More Reasonable Assumptions


Shortly after PetIQ’s acquisition of VIP in Jan 2018, management announced plans to roll out 1,000 fixed-location pet wellness centers in 
Walmart stores and other big-box retailers through FY23. Company estimates regarding wellness center maturation imply that management sees 


the wellness centers generating ~$500M in revenue and $110 in operating profit by FY23. However, we believe that management assumptions 
regarding wellness center unit economics at maturity are extremely aggressive. Spruce Point estimates that, if management maintains its roll-


out schedule, the wellness centers will generate just $225M in revenue by FY23, and will not turn cash flow positive for several years thereafter.

What’s Left To Support Sales Growth If The 
Wellness Centers Underperform?


Management and the Street are looking for PetIQ sales to grow by 15% annually over the next two years. Much of that growth, however, is driven 
by projected sales growth from new health and wellness centers. Given management’s stated roll-out schedule and per-store revenue targets, 


the Company is expecting the services segment to contribute 57% of total sales growth over the next two years, and 77% of sales growth in 
FY20 alone. This implies that management expects growth in the core products business to contract to 4% by FY20. Should the new wellness 


centers struggle to meet revenue targets, PetIQ revenue could seriously disappoint versus guidance and consensus estimates.

business line for which management is issuing aggressive guidance?

There’s Something About Those Rebates…


As we note, in FY17, over 100% of pro forma earnings for the combined PetIQ-VIP company were attributable to vendor rebates. Interestingly, as 
part of his involvement in entities related to the Petters Ponzi scheme through the early-to-mid 2000s, current PetIQ CEO Cord Christensen was 
affiliated with subsidiaries of Fleming Corporation, which was later shown to be engaging in fraudulent activity related to vendor rebates at the 
time. We also note that, in 2015, mirroring the allegations in the Fleming court proceedings, PetIQ (then known as “True Science”) was accused 


of engaging in fraudulent and strong-arm practices to flatter Company financials at the expense of (closely-associated) vendors. Given 
Christensen’s and the Company’s own dubious history related to rebates and their treatment of vendor relationships, we are concerned about 


the fact that PetIQ appears to depend heavily on vendor rebates for earnings today.

Cap Structure And Valuation


Source: Company financials, Bloomberg consensus, Spruce Point adjustments and estimates


$ in mm, except per share estimates


PetIQ trades at handsome valuation on the popular belief that its margins – already substantially higher than industry averages – are sustainable 
and have room to expand, and that its targeted revenue growth of ~15% (already walked back from 20%) is within reach. We find both of these 


outcomes highly unlikely. Further, PETQ’s valuation is inflated by liberal Non-GAAP adjustments which draw no pushback from sell-side 
analysts. We find that many of management’s Non-GAPP add-backs represent important and unavoidable costs associated with its growth 


strategy which, as such, should not be adjusted out of earnings. Consequently, PetIQ is more levered than it would otherwise seem, which will 
amplify its inevitable share price decline once investors recognize that the business won’t hit its targets and will continue to burn cash.

The Street Loves A Good Secular Growth Story 
That Can Be Pitched To Retail Investors


PetIQ has gained traction on the Street as a play on the “humanization of pets”: pet owners are increasingly “treating their pets as family,” 
driving increased spending on pet products generally and on pet health and wellness in particular. The bulls say that PetIQ stands to benefit 


from this as the dominant distributor of veterinary pharmaceuticals into the retail channel, and that it opened an entirely new avenue to adjacent 
growth with the VIP acquisition. It’s an easily-digested narrative and a superficially attractive story for growth-oriented investors, so long as 


they’re willing to take management at its word. Boo-yah!

The CEO’s Dubious Past


CEO McCord “Cord” Christensen was prominently involved with a number of entities tied to Tom Petters’ $3.65B Ponzi scheme, which, before 
the Madoff scandal, was the largest recorded Ponzi scheme in U.S. history. While his association with Petters isn’t necessarily a secret – it was 


disclosed in PetIQ’s S-1, and is acknowledged by some sell-side analysts – we believe that investors (particularly less-sophisticated retail 
investors who aren’t plunging the depths of PetIQ’s registration documents or court filings) should be made familiar with a fuller set of facts 


than are disclosed to them through readily-available channels.


Source: Company Website


Investors seeking to diligence the background of PETQ’s CEO on the Company’s website will find no mention of the more questionable 
elements of Christensen’s history, including his personal bankruptcy, his ties to the Thomas Petters Ponzi scheme, his unlawful sale of 


unregistered securities, or association with the accounting fraud at Fleming Corp.


Instead, the Company has chosen to leave these details buried in its SEC filings.

Christensen And The Petters Ponzi Scheme


A “longtime friend of Petters,” Per court documents, Christensen served as President of Petters Consumer Brands / Polaroid from 2003-04. He 
was simultaneously a principal of Lancer Financial Services, LLC, an entity formed in 2001 which was ultimately among the largest funnels into, 


and beneficiaries of, the Petters scheme. Christensen states that he at one point had $3.6M of personal funds invested with Petters,1 and 
ultimately lost $1M when the scheme collapsed.2 The fact remains, however, that Christensen recruited millions of dollars’ worth of investor 


money for Petters while a c-suite executive of Petters’ company.

Should Have Been Aware Of The Scheme Given 
His Proximity To It?


In 2004, Christensen left Polaroid to join Broadsign, a digital advertising firm of which Petters was primary shareholder,1,2 and whose US 
headquarters was located in the same office building as Petters Group Worldwide. Per court filings, Christensen received two “termination 
payments” totaling $2.5M upon leaving Polaroid, dwarfing his 2003 bonus of $100K. The bankruptcy court characterized these payments as 


inappropriate, and suggested that Christensen should have been aware that “…he was benefitting from fraudulent activity….” He was replaced 
2-3 years later by the former CFO of Petters Group Worldwide1 and reassigned within the company,3 though his LinkedIn account suggests that 


he was “CEO” throughout his tenure.

Christensen Continues To Recruit Investors To 
Petters Throughout 2000s


Per Nevada business filings and Christensen’s Minnesota bankruptcy documents, Lancer’s business status was revoked in 2005 when it failed 
to report a list of its officers to Nevada’s Secretary of State. However, in 2006, Christensen, alongside Chad Longson, appears to have 


established C&C Capital, LLC, which continued to accept investments for Petters per PwC’s analysis of the scheme. Between Jan and Jul 2008, 
C&C – formally set up to engage in real estate financing – sold $3.3M of (unregistered) promissory notes backed by “inventory financing.” We 


note that this kind of activity was at the core of the Petters scheme – and, of course, that C&C was listed as having raised funds for Petters.

C&C Business Partner Brought Into The Fold At 
PetIQ


One would imagine that Christensen would want to distance himself from his history with the Petters scheme as much as possible, particularly 
as the CEO of a near-billion-dollar market cap public company. Yet Christensen not only continues to do business with Chad Longson, his 


former business partner at C&C, but has given him a senior title at PetIQ: Vice President of Real Estate. We find it morbidly humorous at best, 
but highly concerning otherwise, that Longson was designated VP of Real Estate at PetIQ just several years after abusing a real estate financing 


entity to engage in fraudulent “inventory financing.”


Outside of PetIQ, Longson claims on LinkedIn to own an entity by the name of “Xstream Capital LLC.” We find little information about this 
business, but we do see that he is a listed manager of “Xtreme Finance LLC,” which appears to be a used car dealership doing business as 


“Global Auto Sales” in Boise, ID. The Yelp reviews of this business are not encouraging.

Fleming, Rainbow Foods, Food 4 Less, And 
Dunigan: Vendor Rebate Manipulation


Perhaps the most relevant and interesting relationships unearthed in the analysis of the Petters scheme are those between Christensen and 
Food 4 Less, Rainbow Foods, and Dunigan Fuels. The PwC analysis shows that Christensen and John Simrell were affiliated with Food 4 Less at 


some point during the scheme, and that the entity had invested in the scheme through them. At the time, Simrell was Retail CFO of Fleming 
Companies, a wholesale and retail grocer of which Food 4 Less was a subsidiary. Rainbow Foods was another Fleming subsidiary in the early 
2000s, and also invested in the Petters scheme through Christensen and Pat Liska – then Director of Retail Operations with Rainbow Foods. 


Meanwhile, Christensen himself was President of Dunigan Fuels – yet another Fleming subsidiary – through the early 2000s.


It is around this time that a class action suit was brought against Fleming for inflating earnings through a vendor rebate manipulation scheme.

“Flem-ron”


The Fleming scheme involved management’s use of vendor deductions without vendor authorization with the intent of improving cash flow and 
inflating earnings after launching its discount “Food 4 Less” concept store. Management convinced analysts and investors that the earnings 


improvement was due to the success of the new concept, but its earnings growth was in fact driven by the unilateral enforcement of 
unauthorized vendor rebates. This scheme was orchestrated in part by then Fleming CFO John Simrell – the same individual who was shown to 


have orchestrated Food 4 Less’ investment in the Petters scheme with Cord Christensen.


Source


Christensen’s apparent relationship with Fleming management is particularly concerning to us given PetIQ’s and VIP Petcare’s 
demonstrated dependence on vendor rebates for earnings, as well as True Science’s apparent dependence from 2010-16 on non-arms-length 


relationships with veterinary drug vendors – one of which accused True Science of attempting to use the close relationship to inflate 
earnings through accounting manipulation.

Management’s Association With A 
Sordid Cast Of Characters

Management Hiding PetIQ’s Full History?


On recent earnings calls, management has alluded to being involved with the business for nine to ten years. Business records confirm that True 
Science LLC – PetIQ’s previous business name – was established in 2010, and that current CEO McCord “Cord” Christensen and former 


President Scott Adcock became managing members of the business at around that time. However, as we show in the following slides, we find 
that the history of the business extends almost ten years earlier – and that it has been mired in legal controversy from the beginning.

WTF?


Spruce Point finds that True Science was preceded by another Florida entity registered as “W.T.F. Wholesale Inc.” and “W.T.F. Wholesale 
Suppliers Corp.” W.T.F. made news in 2011-13 when over 20 veterinarians filed suit against the business after it failed to reimburse them for 


drugs ordered on its behalf as part of a veterinary drug diversion operation. In 2010-11, W.T.F. ordered tens of thousands to hundreds of 
thousands of dollars’ worth of drugs from dozens of veterinarians before suddenly “going out of business” on August 19, 2011 without paying, 


only to continue to conduct business with the same staff at the same location under the name “True Lines Distributing.” Note that the name 
“True Lines Distributing Ltd. Co.” was registered to True Science Holdings, LLC in Idaho just one month earlier, on July 21, 2011, and the name 
“True Lines Distributing LLC” was registered to True Science Holdings in Florida soon thereafter. W.T.F. = True Lines = True Science = PetIQ.

A History Of Accusations Of Alleged Shady 
Dealings


2011 wasn’t the first time W.T.F. found itself embroiled in legal battles. Filings show that Todd Stefaniak – W.T.F.’s managing member since 
inception – founded “W.T.F. Wholesale Inc.” in 2001 with Wayne Godwin. Just two years later, the original W.T.F. was dissolved – and Stefaniak 
and Godwin found themselves in a dispute in which Godwin accused Stefaniak of misappropriating W.T.F. assets to launch a separate “W.T.F. 
Wholesale Suppliers Corp.” of which Stefaniak was the sole owner, though Stefaniak won an injunction against Godwin in the case. Four years 
later, Godwin sued Stefaniak for failing to close a joint bank account previously used for the original W.T.F., and for accepting payments (over 


$100K total) intended for Godwin’s own pet products distributor (Professional Pest Products Inc.) through 2006. The case was ultimately settled.


Stefaniak was also sued by pet toy maker Kong for allegedly reselling toys to Costco after purchasing them from Kong at a heavy discount, 
under the guise of giving them to W.T.F.’s veterinarian partners as quarterly “thank you” gifts. The case was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

Stefaniak Swept Under The Rug?


Importantly, Stefaniak appears to have been prominently involved in the business well into Adcock’s and Christensen’s terms as executives. On 
his LinkedIn page, Stefaniak claims to have been True Science Holdings’ Vice President of Operations from Jun 2010 through Nov 2015, and its 
CTO from Nov 2015 through Apr 2016 – just weeks after the Company filed its first registration document with the SEC in anticipation of going 


public.1 Though Stefaniak did not remain with the Company through the IPO as an employee, his “NBTS Holdings,” of which he was a 70% 
owner as of Jun 2017, was listed as a 5% stockholder of PetIQ in its S-1 filed on Jun 23, 2017. Interestingly, in PetIQ’s second amendment to its 


S-1 filed on Jul 11 – just three weeks later – neither NBTS Holdings nor Stefaniak are anywhere to be seen.

Questionable Activity Continues Well Into 
Christensen’s And Adcock’s Tenure


In 2016, PetIQ sued John Farrens and his Blue Ridge Pharmaceutical Distribution, Inc. – a provider of veterinary drugs to PetIQ – for stealing 
~$1.5M deposited with him by PetIQ for the purpose of purchasing veterinary drugs, shortly before winding down his firm. The details of the suit 


illustrate what appears to be a very questionable business arrangement. The complaint alleges that True Science appointed Farrens to be a 
buying agent for veterinary drugs in 2012, but that it was agreed that he would be a third-party agent. Though a formally independent entity, Blue 


Ridge would be “entirely dependent upon True Science’s continuing relationship,” and Farrens would be given equity in True Science. In his 
response to PetIQ’s complaint, Farrens accused the Company of, among other things, fraud: management allegedly used its relationship with 
Blue Ridge – formally a third-party, but effectively a captive vendor – to “increase their book value and misrepresent their assets,” and their 


accounting practices had triggered a federal investigation. PetIQ disputed this allegation, and the case was ultimately settled, but we find these 
allegations extremely concerning.


PetIQ v. John Farrens: Complaint


We find these allegations particularly concerning given CEO Christensen’s documented history with other vendor rebate accounting
schemes approximately ten years earlier. This alleged activity sounds not unlike the “strong-arm tactics” cited in the Fleming case.


PetIQ v. John Farrens: Counter-Allegations
27


Part Of A Broader Pattern?


The nature of Farrens’ arranged “third-party” relationship with True Science and, if true, the accounting practices which it allegedly enabled, give 
us concern that they were part of a broader pattern of behavior for the Company. Indeed, we find that, in 2010, Farrens was named an officer of 


Ridium Pharmacy Services, Inc. – another entity formed by Stefaniak in 2007, and located at the site of W.T.F. as of 2010. Was Ridium yet another 
licensed veterinary pharmaceutical vendor set up to purchase drugs for True Science, but kept separate for financial presentation reasons?


We also note that Paula Bullock – the North Carolina-based veterinarian installed as an officer of Ridium at the same time as Farrens, and current 
owner of Affordable Animal Care in Durham, NC – had her veterinary license suspended by the North Carolina Veterinary Medical Board in 2016, 


and is currently being tried for stealing over $50,000 to cover personal expenses and veterinary pharmaceuticals.

PetIQ/True Science, W.T.F., Blue Ridge, And 
Ridium (And Others?) Closely Intertwined


It appears that True Science, W.T.F., Blue Ridge, and Ridium also shared officers through the 2010s. Nancy (Ben Hamo) Meisenberg reports 
serving as General Manager of W.T.F., General Manager of Ridium, and Director of Procurement for Blue Ridge simultaneously through parts of 
2002-13. Recall from PetIQ’s original S-1 that she owns 30% of Stefaniak’s NBTS Holdings. Furthermore, Maureen (Lawrence) Bell, President of 
Ridium from 2010 until its dissolution in 2016 (after it lost its veterinarian drug sales license in 2012, though it appears to have continued to do 


business nonetheless), reports having served as a Product Specialist for True Science since 2011, overlapping with her Ridium tenure.


Finally, we note that 530 Fentress Blvd. in Daytona Beach, FL – the last address at which Ridium was located from 2014-16 – was a True Science 
location during the same period, and is currently a PetIQ location.

Veterinarian Partners Potentially Buying In Size 
For True Science


Just how large were these operations? One former Blue Ridge account manager on Indeed.com reports managing 30-50 orders per day, 
“amounting to around $200,000,” to be processed “no more than 14 business days from the time [they were] issued” in 2015 and perhaps earlier. 
If all or a significant share of these orders were made on behalf of True Science, as the PetIQ v. Farrens complaint would imply, Blue Ridge alone 
could have been responsible for over 25% of True Science FY15 sales of $206M (at run rate, since Blue Ridge supposedly shut down in late 2015).

Note that, given the date of this review (Sep 22, 2015), it was likely posted by an employee who worked at Blue Ridge at some point during 
2014-15 or 2013-15, when we know from court filings that True Science was Blue Ridge’s primary (and only?) customer.


Is PetIQ still a customer now that Blue Ridge appears to be back in business?

Blue Ridge Back In Business – But Without A 
License?


Interestingly, at least one other former account manager on Indeed.com questions the legality of Blue Ridge’s activities. Blue Ridge appears to be 
back in business: its website is up, its North Carolina business registration is active, and former employees have discussed the company on 


Indeed.com as recently as January of this year. However, Florida’s Department of Business and Professional Regulation lists its veterinary drug 
distribution license as having lapsed in 2017. Florida’s Department of Health suggests that it lapsed as early as 2013. We can find no record of a 


pharmaceutical distribution license on file in North Carolina for the business.

If Blue Ridge was buying from veterinarians rather than directly from manufacturers, why did True Science need it in the first place?

W.T.F. / True Science / PetIQ Margins Were In Line 
With Industry Before Vendor Relationships Formed


As discussed, PetIQ demonstrates unusually high margins for a drug distributor of any kind – veterinary or human. We wonder how it has been 
able to maintain such profitability levels. Interestingly, from W.T.F. tax returns disclosed during one of the suits brought against the company by 
a former veterinarian business partner, we observe that, prior to 2011, the company posted margins much more in line with those of other drug 
distributors. We recognize that PetIQ is now a much larger business, and that it may enjoy some level of operating leverage. However, we find it 
interesting that company profitability was less atypical of drug distributors until, under new CEO Christensen, it began to build non-arms-length
relationships with third-party veterinary drug vendors – which, according to Farrens’ allegations, were used to flatter True Science’s financials.

PetIQ Also Cleansed Of Former CFO?


Does Farrens’ allegation suggest that True Science used non-arms-length relationships with third-party veterinary drug vendors to flatter their 
reported financials? We can’t be certain of this. We find it interesting, however, that, much like Stefaniak , Tom Stevenson – True Science’s CFO 
from around the time that Christensen and Adcock joined, and a business partner of Adcock’s in a number of other ventures – left the Company 


at some point prior to the IPO. He would have been True Science’s CFO over the same period during which these relationships were formed. 
Was he let go to put further distance between True Science’s past and the PetIQ of today?

We also note that PetIQ / True Science President and Co-Founder Scott Adcock departed the Company just several months after it went public. 
Christensen cited health reasons for his departure on the Q3 FY17 earnings call, but it is still notable to us that a founder of the business would 
leave so early into its existence as a public company. We wonder: now that he no longer needs to disclose sales of PETQ shares, how much has 


he been selling? Why does he appear to still be active in a number of his (many) other business interests?

Summary: A History Of Dubious Business 
Activities


The preceding slides have covered a wide range of questionable activity by PetIQ’s legacy businesses, as well as by a number of its officers.
We recognize that the connections which we draw can be difficult to follow at first. By way of summary, we believe that the following takeaways 


and questions should be of interest to investors in light of the information discussed throughout the preceding slides.


History of PetIQ
• W.T.F. Wholesale Suppliers, PetIQ’s predecessor, was fraught with legal troubles and allegations of fraud throughout its ten-year existence
• W.T.F.’s managing member continued to be heavily involved with the business alongside current CEO Cord Christensen up until it began the 


process of preparing to go public, at which point he was swiftly removed from Company documentation
• A former business partner alleged that PetIQ (then known as “True Science”) used non-arms-length relationships with third-party drug 


vendors to manufacture flattering financial figures, and that this activity had triggered a federal investigation of Company accounting
• We observe signs that PetIQ and its predecessor businesses were engaged with multiple other third-party veterinary drug vendors with which 


it had close relationships via shared personnel, shared addresses, etc.


Trustworthiness of Executive Team
• Current PetIQ management was present for a period during which the Company was accused of accounting fraud with non-arms-length third-


party business partners
• Current PetIQ executives worked with the dubious founder of W.T.F., PetIQ’s predecessor, for a period of at least five years
• PetIQ’s current management team consists of a number of people with very questionable business backgrounds outside of the Company. 


Upper management appears happy to give senior positions to past business partners from questionable ventures.
• Executives are not transparent about their respective professional backgrounds
• Question: Can investors really trust PetIQ management?


Economics of The Business
• In attempting to grow as a veterinary drug distributor, True Science / PetIQ was likely limited in its ability to scale the business due to 


manufacturer restrictions against selling to anyone but veterinarians, and therefore in its ability to purchase drugs in size at a discount
• Presently, PetIQ’s outsized profitability appears to potentially be driven by rebates passed on from veterinarians (now received directly from 


manufacturers via VIP)
• Before it began to engage with non-arms-length vendors in ~2010-11, Company profitability (from its W.T.F. days) was much more in line with 


that of other drug distributors (human and veterinarian)
• Question: Was the Company able to generate outsized profitability leading up to its IPO only through these non-arms-length relationships?
• Question: After PetIQ outgrew these relationships, did it acquire VIP to obtain similarly attractive economics through a captive veterinary 


drug vendor with direct access to manufacturer rebates? Is this business economical whatsoever without rebates or special vendor
relationships? How sustainable are these rebates now that Merial and other manufacturers have begun to go direct to retail?


• Question: In light of Christensen’s relationship with vendor rebate fraud, what exactly is the nature of PetIQ’s current vendor rebates, which 
accounted for over 100% of pro-forma earnings for the combined PetIQ-VIP company in FY17?

(of Boehringer Ingelheim).


OTC flea & tick medication comprises 30-40% of PetIQ sales. Unfortunately for PetIQ, consumers have generally been shifting away from topical 
solutions in favor of orals. Meanwhile, declining Frontline effectiveness following a recent formula change, together with the arrival of cheaper 


competitors, has helped to shrink Frontline’s share since 2014.

PetIQ Product Sales Growth Completely Out-
Of-Line With Tracked Category Growth


Nielsen data suggests that sales growth in the flea and tick category has been consistently negative through the past several quarters. This 
stands in stark contrast to PetIQ product sales, which, per management, saw organic growth of 45% in FY18. Management ascribes the gaping 
divergence between product segment sales and Nielsen data to sales growth through untracked channels, which, per management, comprise 


72% of sales as of Q4. However, according to PetIQ’s 10-K, Walmart and Sam’s Club together represented 24% of company-wide sales (and 
probably an even greater percentage of product segment sales: they represented 46% of Company sales in FY17, before the VIP acquisition). 
This would imply that just 4% of all other channels are tracked – yet we know that PetIQ sells through other tracked channels such as Costco, 


Target, BJ’s, and other big-box and pet specialty retailers. Is management really suggesting that these other tracked retailers represent no more 
than 4% of sales in total? Why is sales growth through tracked channels allegedly so different from sales growth through untracked channels 


anyways, and why is PetIQ able to so powerfully outpace the negative growth of one of its major categories?


PETQ: FY18 10-K


“For the fourth quarter, our flea and tick business performed well and outpaced category growth. According to Nielsen 
measured channel data through December 31, the flea and tick category was down 10.7%.
PetIQ’s results outpaced this result in the Nielsen measured channels over the same period. Our brands performed 
better than the overall market, non-measured channels were up meaningfully and our prescription drug flea and tick was up 
significantly and in-line with the macro trends in the broader veterinarian market.


Keep in mind, for PetIQ only 28% of our Q4 sales were in Nielsen measured sales channels. The 72% of our sales that 
were in unmeasured sales channels dramatically outpaced the measured flea and tick sales channels, particularly in the 
e-commerce and RX sales channels.”

Paltry R&D Spending For An "Innovative" Company


Research & Development Spend Research & Development Spend as a % of Sales


Product Innovation, A “Key Element Of 
[PetIQ’s] Growth Strategy,” At A Standstill


Management refers to PetIQ on earnings calls as an “innovative” company with a focus on product portfolio expansion. The Company’s 10-K 
states that product improvement and new product development is a “key element of our growth strategy,” and that company results have 


“material” downside risk to a lack of success in product development. However, PetIQ contributes less than one tenth of 1% of sales to R&D, on 
which it spent as little as $33,000 in Q3 FY18 – down close to 80% since the time of the IPO. R&D grew in Q4 largely due to its acquisition of HBH 


Enterprises, not of a renewed internal initiative to invest in R&D.


“The company is focused and executing on the following 
initiatives:…. Second, innovation; we're focused on further 
product development and innovation in each of the pet 
categories that we participate in and continue to broaden our 
portfolio across each of our factories' manufacturing 
disciplines.”

EBITDA Margin: PetIQ vs. Peers


Inexplicable Margin Gap vs. Peers Implies 
Downside To Profitability


Spruce Point believes that there is little room for material competitive advantage in the world of veterinary drug distribution. This conjecture is 
borne out in industry profitability levels: PetIQ peers consistently generate EBITDA margins between 4 and 5%, with little variation between 


them. Yet PetIQ’s legacy business reported Adj. EBITDA margins of over 8% in the year prior to the VIP acquisition (even higher when corporate 
expenses are ignored). We see little reason as to why PetIQ’s distribution business should be able to sustainably support twice the margins of 
its peer group or more – yet management sees even greater upside to segment profitability at current levels. We believe that Company margin 
guidance is far too aggressive, and that segment profitability will inevitably correct downwards – particularly as industry competition expands.


Why can PetIQ’s products 
business support EBITDA 
margins more than double 


those of peers?


Profitability levels of human medication 
distributors – which could be in 
position to enter the veterinary 


medication distribution business within 
the foreseeable future – imply even 
greater downside to PetIQ product 


segment margins.

over patent infringement or other anticompetitive behavior. Management communicates to investors that it is common for industry players to be 


engaged in IP-related litigation, but our conversations with industry representatives suggest that PetIQ is particularly aggressive in flouting 
competitor patents to a point that others view as egregious.

PetIQ Has Occupied An Ethically Questionable 
Marketplace


PetIQ got its start in the industry as a pure “grey market” distributor: it would buy medication from licensed veterinarians and resell the product 
to the retail channel. Until only recently, prominent veterinary drug manufacturers would sell only to sanctioned veterinary distributors and 


licensed veterinarians, which left retailers dependent on veterinarians and unauthorized grey-market distributors like PetIQ for pet medication.


Veterinary drug diversion, while ethically questionable, is technically not illegal in most states – and, where it is, the relevant laws often aren’t 
strictly enforced. However, the threat of greater oversight and enforcement over the veterinary grey market represents a constant threat to 


PetIQ’s business.

Management Does Its Best To Avoid Direct 
Association With Grey Market


Management has done its best to distance itself from public association with the grey market and to avoid describing itself as a grey market 
distributor, both explicitly and in effect. Management was more open in its original draft registration, submitted on Mar 9, 2016 (and repeated in 


its amended draft registration submitted Jun 17, 2016). Here, management stated explicitly that it had no major direct relationships with 
manufacturers, and that it sourced primarily from veterinarians. After being questioned on its business model by the SEC, PetIQ edited this risk 


factor in its amended filing submitted the following year – as well as in its S-1 filed shortly thereafter – to wipe all allusions to sourcing from 
veterinarians or other grey market sources.

Tough Spot For A Legal Officer


We wonder what kind of lawyer would be interested in serving as a legal officer for a business whose entire business model involved operating 
in a legally-nebulous marketplace. Until recently, it was Robert Mooney, who joined the Company in June 2013, a period during which it was 


potentially involved in highly dubious activity. He served as PetIQ’s General Counsel from June 2013 through this past March 2019. We note that 
Mooney declared bankruptcy in Aug 2012.1 Interestingly, Mooney was never a listed officer with PetIQ, absolving the company from having to 
disclose this part of his background, and from having to issue an 8-K upon his departure. This is made all the more interesting by the fact that 


his replacement, R. Michael Herrman, is in fact a listed officer.

Threats Of Disintermediation And Increasing 
Competition Loom Over PetIQ


Due to the dubious nature of the grey market, the prescription veterinary drug supply chain has until now been highly inefficient, with retailers 
relying on shady distributors to obtain product by potentially questionable means. Manufacturers sold to veterinarians, who in turn resold to 


grey market distributors, who in turn sold the drugs to other distributors with direct relationships with large retail outlets.


Would PetIQ benefit from the formalization of the retail channel for veterinary drugs? Management certainly thinks so: PetIQ has for five years 
paid lobbyists to back the Fairness to Pet Owners Act (FTPOA), which would force veterinarians to issue portable prescriptions, and which 
would lay a clear legal path for manufacturers to sell to retail. However, we believe that this would invite well-resourced Rx distributors like 


Cardinal and McKesson to enter the now-legitimized supply chain. Increased competition would threaten PetIQ margins as it loses its current 
status as the dominant distributor of pet care products into the retail channel.


Note that this process has already begun: after Bayer began selling directly to retail in 2010, Merial finally ended its holdout last year and began 
to sell Frontline into the retail channel. At the same time, PetIQ has experienced material margin pressure.


The dominance of PetIQ’s distributed Rx business relies on the current structure of veterinary pharmaceutical distribution. Passage of the 
FTPOA might increase sales in the short term, but would increase competition and pressure profitability over the medium-to-long term.

Gross Margin Will Only Get Worse Going 
Forward


We are surprised that the sell side seems to think that gross margin in the product segment could expand through the coming years despite the 
strong relative growth of sales of distributed product vs. manufactured product, as cited by management. This mix shift, driven by continued 


penetration into retail with its popular distributed products (Frontline, Heartgard, etc.), is unlikely to reverse as sales growth continues to come 
from increased retail penetration, and as new product R&D remains comically low. This, combined with rising competitive pressure due to the 
“opening up” of the pet care retail distribution space, will drive product segment (and company-wide) gross margin down further through the 
coming quarters and years. Importantly, management makes no real attempt to dispute this notion on earnings calls, instead communicating 


that it is targeting sales and profit growth over margin expansion, and discussing “gross margin dollars” over margin percentages. It is guiding 
to flat gross margins in FY19.


PETQ Earnings Call: Q2 FY18


“So the first question I have for Cord, both you and John discussed the – I guess, I'd say somewhat 
disconnects in your results here with sales and gross and on the EBIDTA side. You mentioned that it 
had to do with distributor sales from a distributed product. Can you explain further what that was? And 
then how we should think about that?”


- Brian Nagel – Oppenheimer & Co.


“…so if you look at our flea and tick category on the OTC side, we've had a historical mix in how those products have been purchased in tens 
and thousands of locations over the last five years. And that historical mix, we've continued to believe it'd be the same. And one key 
difference is, in 2018, and for second quarter, which is really peak season and definitely the first quarter of this year's season, it's the first time 
ever that we've had our partners in the animal health companies actively doing a great job supporting their products and their items and being 
organized in it.


And we projected that, that support would create a certain mix that would create a certain result. So when we sell one of those distributed 
boxes, three months supply on our wholesale revenue basis, it was roughly $32 post sales for us. The generic version that we 
manufactured is roughly a $10 to $12 price for the same three months supply. We got our penny profit, our $1 per box is roughly the 
same, Brian.
…What we've seen differently is, we've sold more $32 boxes than $10 boxes. And so that's why when you look at our gross margin dollars 
for the quarter, they’re right in line with what we thought we would have because the margin were agnostic and why the EBITDA number is 
online with that is we’re really get our growth rate, our unit growth rate, but the mix is a little bit different.”

Economics And Dubious Accounting

Structural Flaws In The Retail-Based Model?


In Jan 2018, PetIQ paid a total of $220M to acquire VIP Petcare, an operator of veterinary clinics and pet wellness centers. One of the five largest 
veterinary clinic businesses in the country at the time of the acquisition (per management), VIP operated 2,900 “pop-up” clinics and 76,000 


mobile clinics across 31 states as of Jan 2018. Management speaks about its vision for the combined business as a “one-stop shop” for 
consumers’ veterinary needs: with PetIQ veterinarians now under the same roof as its manufactured and distributed products (and the 


customer’s other groceries), consumers can take care of both their general shopping and their pets’ medical needs in a single trip to Walmart. 
However, per the FDA, non-service animals are not permitted to enter locations where groceries are sold (most Walmart locations). In fact, it is 


against Walmart policy for customers to be accompanied by pets – a policy which some locations have historically not enforced, but which was 
recently given stronger teeth at the direction of Walmart management.1 Side entrances will be installed at Walmart locations with wellness 


centers to allow pets to enter without having to pass through the store.

If customers can’t venture into the store with their pets – forcing them either to leave their pets in the car (which most pet owners prefer not to 
do) or to return to the store to purchase whatever else they intended to buy – does the in-store wellness center model really save customers a 


trip to the vet? Is it any more convenient than a stand-alone veterinarian (especially considering their limited service offerings)?

Greenfielding An Entirely New (And Risky) 
Business Line


Since it acquired VIP early last year, management has said that it plans to open 1,000 health and wellness centers in Walmart and other retailers 
by 2023. However, these centers operate on a very different model than VIP’s legacy clinics. VIP clinics have neither a fixed location nor 


permanent employees: rather, they are scheduled at different locations on varying dates, and are staffed by veterinarians who bid for the day’s 
work. PetIQ’s new fixed-location wellness centers will be supported by a very different cost structure – one which will inevitably carry higher 
labor costs and G&A per location than do VIP clinics. VIP currently operates only 15 such fixed locations, and our conversations with people 
knowledgeable about VIP suggest that they were among the company’s least lucrative clinics. Investors should not assume that PetIQ’s new 
wellness centers are an immediate extension of the VIP business, nor that PetIQ acquired the expertise to execute on its wellness center plan 


when it acquired VIP.

Setting Up Shop In Walmart Isn’t An 
Automatic Ticket To Customers


We believe that the market is overly-confident in the “customer traffic synergies” which PetIQ wellness centers may observe from their presence 
in Walmart and other big-box retailers: customer traffic to the big-box retailer doesn’t automatically draw customer traffic to the store-within-the-


store. Just ask CPI Corp., which operated more than 2,000 photo studios in Walmart, Sears, and other retailers before going out of business in 
Apr 2013. To the extent that pet owners want a “one-stop shop” for their veterinary needs, they would do better to seek out a veterinarian in a 


Petco or PetSmart, both of which permit pet owners to bring their pets into the store while they shop. If pet owners can’t do their shopping and 
take their pets to the vet at the same time at Walmart, does VetIQ benefit from its presence in Walmart at all?


Setting up shop in Walmart isn’t an automatic ticket to 
customers…


…and Walmart can’t be a comprehensive one-stop 
shop for pet owners if pets aren’t allowed in the store…


…so what value is there in putting a fixed-location veterinary clinic in Walmart?

PetIQ Late To The In-Store Wellness Center 
Game, And Roll-Out Is Progressing Slowly


In its own statements about PetIQ’s plans to grow its service business, it is clear that Walmart is not yet committed to a large-scale rollout of 
PetIQ wellness centers, and is monitoring the performance of locations opened in FY18. Accordingly, after opening 17 wellness centers in Q2 


FY18, PetIQ opened just two in Q3 and three in Q4. Even then, Walmart does not necessarily appear to feel wedded to PetIQ: during its October 
investor day, management highlighted competitor Essentials Petcare rather than PetIQ as its veterinary services provider. Note that Essentials 


Petcare has been operating veterinary clinics out of Walmart stores since 2016.

Veterinary Clinic Competition Heating Up Just 
As PetIQ Enters The Space


The veterinary care space has become increasingly competitive through the last several years, as well-recognized companies such as Petco 
have launched a number of in-store veterinary concepts since 2017. Of particular note for PetIQ / VIP is Essentials Petcare, whose model is 


almost identical to that of VetIQ: it operates small walk-in clinics in grocery stores and other retail outlets and offers only basic health services, 
and is competing directly with VIP for Walmart real estate. Interestingly, its website prominently promotes that it issues portable prescriptions –
that is, it does not require customers to fill their prescriptions at Essentials Petcare. Meanwhile, employee reviews of VIP Petcare suggest that 


VIP is aggressive in attempting to upsell customers on veterinary drugs.


We believe that industry competitiveness will hit VetIQ particularly hard as it attempts to roll-out 1,000 fixed-location wellness centers with 
traditional hours. PetIQ will inevitably have to hire more veterinarians per store and pay them more competitively to support such practices, 


which will make it even harder for its new stores to achieve break-even cash flow (see the Pets At Home earnings call comment below).


SourceSource Source, Source


“But life has changed. It’s changed dramatically in the last few years. And our model needs to change to 
reflect that. The supply of vets is super challenging. And that’s led to salary growth not just in vets, 
but in nurses and in practice managers. And if your already a young practice, that solid growth hits 
you disproportionately harder than it does in mature practices. That path to profitability of younger 
practices has lengthened and has delayed returns to our JVPs. It’s also increasing that cash support that 
we’ve had to put into those businesses.


We’ve been too focused on practice rollout rather than driving cash from our invested practices. And 
given the recent high number of openings, we have so many startup practices and we expect them to 
be loss-making in their early years. Typically, a practice becomes cash-generative around year five, and 
we expect that revenue to build as the customer base builds, remembering that our practices start off with no 
clients whatsoever. People don’t easily change their vet.” – PETS:LN Earnings Call, Nov 27 2018

Substandard Care And A Focus On Product 
Sales Seems To Be The Norm For VIP Petcare


VIP Petcare clinics are designed to be just that – clinics. In human terms, the experience is more analogous to going to an impersonal 
vaccination clinic than to going to a trusted doctor with whom you might develop a longer-term relationship. VIP Petcare vets set up shop in a 


designated location for several hours and attend to marginal needs: vaccinations, microchipping, etc. Per customer and employee reviews, this 
appears to lend itself to an environment of relative indifference and, accordingly, a subpar level of care.

Notice that there is a theme among the negative (and even some positive) reviews: clinic managers pay outsized attention to profits over 
pets, and employees are encouraged to upsell patients to expensive medications. This is not surprising to us given that product sales are

PETQ Service Sales / Legacy VIP Sales:
Actual vs. Guidance vs. Initial Estimate


Actual Guidance Initial Estimate


Wide Disconnect Between Initial Sales Estimate And 
Eventual Guidance, And Disappointing Growth


When PetIQ first purchased VIP, management implicitly suggested on its March Q4 FY17 earnings call that the new services segment would 
contribute $100-125M of sales on an annual basis. Interestingly, management did not seem comfortable talking about sales figures for VIP in 


total dollar terms, instead reverting to a rough estimate of 25% of company sales. FY18 guidance for service segment sales ultimately came in at 
$80-95M on the April acquisition call, and actual sales came in at just $78M. We find it extremely curious that management could be so off in its 


estimates for VIP sales. How could management have such little visibility into a stable, diversified, steadily-growing business?

“Now, 75% of what’s now a $450 million to $500 million number is a 
significant number and a significant increase. And, ultimately, we’re really 
excited about that part of our business as well. That leaves 25% of the 
business to be service-related in that segment that we haven’t been in. 
We’re not prepared yet to put any specific numbers out.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


VIP sales ultimately grew by only 9% in FY18 off their FY17 base of $72M. Note that this growth figure includes growth from new Walmart 
wellness centers opened throughout the year, which were not included in the FY18 guidance figure. We estimate that new clinics contributed 


$5M of revenue in FY18, leaving the majority of service segment growth attributable to new store openings.

Actual Same-Store Clinic Growth Far Below 
Management Estimates


CEO Cord Christensen stated that he expects the legacy veterinary business, excluding new stores, to support sales growth in the services 
segment of 25%. Spruce Point believes that this is an egregious overestimate, and we are stunned that the CEO of a near-billion-dollar public 


company could be so far off on one of his own business lines. Again, we note that total service segment revenue grew by 9% in FY18. Below we 
estimate that, if new wellness centers hit their year one revenue target of $375K (adjusted for a ramp period), the legacy services business grew 


by just 1.4% in FY18.

Management Guiding To Unrealistic And Potentially 
Misleading Wellness Center Economics


Management is communicating to investors that, while wellness centers will be loss-making in their infancy as they grow their respective 
customer bases, these practices will earn an impressive 30% contribution margin at maturity. Spruce Point finds this conclusion perplexing. 


Before it was bought out by Mars in 2017, VCA Animal Hospitals (NASDAQ: WOOF) earned just 16% gross margins and 13% operating margins 
on its animal hospital segment, which conducts the kind of higher-ticket and higher-margin medical procedures which VIP avoids. How could a 


VIP / VetIQ wellness center possibly be so much more profitable than VCA’s animal hospitals, even at maturity?

Are Wellness Center Unit Economics Being 
Modeled Appropriately?


We believe that PetIQ is using Banfield Pet Hospitals – a division of Mars, Inc. – as a benchmark for wellness center unit economics estimates. 
The sell-side suggests that Banfield clinics, many of which are located in PetSmart stores, earn $600-800K in revenue annually (~$850M in sales1


across “more than 1,000 hospitals”2). However, for reasons given earlier, we believe that Banfield is not a good proxy for PetIQ’s wellness 
centers: whereas pet owners can bring their pets into PetSmart locations, allowing them to shop for their pets and take them to the vet in a 


single trip, pet owners cannot take their pets into Walmart stores, forcing them to make separate trips for their normal shopping and for taking 
their pets to VetIQ. Accordingly, we believe that PetIQ wellness centers are more similar to stand-alone clinics, which, per Merial, see ~2,000 


animals per vet per year3 – implying just ~$125K in sales per vet on an average ticket of $64 (per management’s Apr 2018 modeling call4).


Further, as of Oct 2015, Banfield employed “more than 3,200 veterinarians,”5 implying an average of over 3 veterinarians per clinic – and, 
accordingly, revenue per veterinarian of just $200-250K, closer to Merial’s single-veterinarian clinic revenue estimates than PetIQ’s. We believe 


that PetIQ wellness centers – most of which, per management, will employ just one veterinarian – will see revenue closer to these levels.

We believe that the Merial-based estimate is most applicable to PetIQ, given that pet owners cannot take their pets into Walmart, making PetIQ 
wellness centers more like stand-alone wellness centers than Banfield’s in-store clinics.

Wellness Centers Could Be Unprofitable Under 
More Realistic Assumptions


We also note that management estimates that it can maintain a clinic with close to five fewer veterinarians than were employed by the typical 
VCA hospital on average, and with one to two fewer veterinarians than are currently employed by the typical Banfield in-store clinic. While we 


recognize that PetIQ clinics will likely require fewer veterinarians than would a full-fledged animal hospital, we question whether management is 
under-budgeting for personnel costs, particularly given the tightness of the veterinarian labor market and VIP’s relative lack of experience with 


fixed-location wellness centers (recall that veterinarians at its pop-up clinics are not full-time employees, but bid for time).
Even taking management’s presumed average of 1.5 vets per clinic as given, we estimate that PetIQ wellness centers will be unprofitable at 


maturity under more reasonable store traffic assumptions.

Misrepresenting Store Gross Margin?


We note that, in its illustration of wellness center unit economics, management allocated wellness center rent expense to SG&A.1 We believe 
that, as brick-and-mortar clinics renting space from retailers, these wellness centers should designate rental expense as a COGS item. In fact, in 
its FY18 10-K, the Company states that services segment occupancy costs are indeed accounted for as COGS, following industry standards (see 


VCA’s last public annual filing below). Why did management account for it in SG&A in the unit economics presentation?


Though restating rent as a COGS item may change the proposed unit economics of PetIQ’s wellness centers at maturity only slightly, we note 
that “store-in-a-store” rental agreements typically include “incentive rent” clauses: tenants must pay higher rents as store revenue grows.2 This 


will limit the operating leverage in the services segment, conflicting with management’s statements about margin expansion opportunities.

Is Management Already Walking Back Its 
Expectations For The Wellness Center Rollout?


Management language suggests that it is losing confidence in the initial targets set for new wellness centers. On its Apr 2018 business update 
call, the Company communicated that new wellness centers would reach maturity within about a year, but that they could take “upwards of 18 


months” “in a slow environment.” Six months later, on the Q3 FY18 earnings call, management changed its new store earnings add-back to 
include stores open for 18 months or less – up from 12 months. When asked about the change, management claimed that it had “been


messaging all along” that “the maturity model is 18 months.” We find it concerning that management would make such a weakly supported 
claim, and that it wasn’t even planning on discussing the change in maturity estimate until questioned about it.


PETQ Earnings Call: Q3 FY18


“This is kind of mechanical in nature, but if I am looking at the way 
you discussed adjusted net income and excluding, I guess the 
clinics primarily, before you were using clinics have been open 
or now opened for a year, now that’s shifted to what seems 
to be 18 months. Why that shift?”


- Brian Nagel – Oppenheimer & Co.


“Yes. Brian, this is John. That’s a great question and thanks for 
bringing it up. We looked at ourselves internally, and we said, we’ve 
been messaging all along that the maturity model on our clinic 
whether it’s our new wellness center or when we enter into new 
markets or with new retail partners, the maturity model is 18 
months. So, therefore when we evaluate the same-store sales add-
back it should be looking at the exact same way.”


- John Newland – CFO, PetIQ


“Ultimately, we think that a typical point that we run will mature to a point where it's 
got a very, very solid consistent number of pets that'll treat on a weekly basis, and 
we're estimating that it takes roughly a little over a year to get to that point. 
And in a slow environment, it could take upwards of 18 months to get there.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


PETQ Financial Modeling Call: Apr 2, 2018


PETQ Earnings Call: Q4 FY18


“As Cord mentioned, we expect [to] open more than 80 new 
wellness centers in 2019 beginning in Q2 with a vast majority of 
wellness centers opening weighted towards the second half of 2019.”


- John Newland – CFO, PetIQ


Management Walking Back Wellness Center Maturation Schedule Management Walking Back FY19 Store Opening Estimate


“If you look at the right side of this chart, this shows the clinic rollout 
schedule as we've organized ourselves internally. For 2018, we 
believe we'll open between 20 and 30 locations; 2019, 80 to 120; and 
you can see the schedule out through 2023 to be able to have over 
1,000 locations operating by the end of 2023.”

Long Road To Positive Cash Flow From New 
Wellness Centers


Even if we assume that PetIQ’s new wellness centers hit their operating targets as defined by management in its financial modeling 
presentation, the Company’s wellness center rollout would fail to generate positive cash flow until FY22 when startup costs ($70K per store) and 
new store capex ($130K) are taken into account. This holds even when we assume that new centers reach maturity at 13 months – the low end of 


management’s 13-18 month estimate.

Wellness Center Rollout A Long-Term Drag 
Under More Reasonable Assumptions


We model annual wellness center revenue more realistically at $300K per center at maturity – about 50% of management’s estimate of $640K, 
but, generously, at 150% of the revenue target implied by Merial’s estimated visits per store (just under $200K), and in line with Banfield’s vet-


adjusted revenue estimates, even though we view the independent vet clinic described by Merial as the better comp for VetIQ wellness centers. 
Also generously assuming that ~82.5% of store COGS are variable costs, we estimate that PetIQ’s new wellness centers will not achieve break-


even operating profit until FY23, and that associated cash flow will remain strongly negative throughout the build-out period.

What’s Left To Support Sales Growth If The 
Wellness Centers Underperform?


Management and the Street are looking for PetIQ sales to grow by 15% annually over the next two years. Much of that growth, however, is driven 
by projected sales growth from new health and wellness centers. Given management’s stated roll-out schedule and per-store revenue targets, 


the Company is expecting the services segment to contribute 57% of total sales growth over the next two years, and 77% of sales growth in 
FY20 alone. This implies that management expects growth in the core products business to contract to 4% by FY20. Should the new wellness 


centers struggle to meet revenue targets, PetIQ revenue could seriously disappoint versus guidance and consensus estimates.

Modeling In Company-Wide Operating 
Leverage Ignores New Store Build SG&A


Management stresses on earnings calls that there is significant leverage in the business, and that sales will grow materially faster than G&A 
even if product mix weighs on product segment gross margin. If there is in fact an opportunity for the Company to capitalize on leverage, it is 
more likely on the more mature products side of the business – yet sell-side analysts model SG&A falling as a percentage of sales across the 
business as a whole, and may not be modeling operating leverage at the segment level. Even assuming that service segment SG&A as a % of 


sales remains flat through the coming years likely underestimates the costs which PetIQ is likely to incur through the wellness center build (new 
store opening costs in particular).

VIP Acquisition: Why Buy Such A 
Weak Business?

Management Not Forthright About PetIQ And 
VIP’s Close Pre-Acquisition Relationship


PetIQ announced the VIP acquisition on Jan 5, 2018. We can be certain that buyout talks and related negotiations between PetIQ and VIP 
extended back to at least Q4 FY17. Moreover, management boasts that it conducted a $500K consulting study several months earlier to justify 


PetIQ’s move into the services industry. We believe the acquisition was likely contemplated for at least six months prior to the acquisition, which 
closed on Jan 17, 2018. Yet management’s statements regarding the prior business relationship between PetIQ and VIP – with which, by


Jan 2018, management should have been intimately aware – appear contradictory. We wonder why management was not able to give a more 
straight-forward characterization of the relationship to investors.


Post-Acquisition Conference Call: Jan 9, 2018


“We have developed a great working relationship with VIP and 
have historically been one of their hosts of business customers.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


“We're very, very different business in the sense that we're 
solely products-focused and their primary business is the 
services side.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


“We were introduced to VIP a couple of years ago and had been 
doing business with VIP across the number of our harder-to-
acquire items as they've had some distribution rights that allow 
them to do business with us.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


Modeling Guidance Call: Apr 2, 2018


“Intercompany sales eliminations were $111 million for full year 
2017. As a reminder, PetIQ previously acted as a customer of 
VIP for certain distributed products. This was done at the 
direction of PetIQ's animal health manufacturer partners.”


- John Newland – CFO, PetIQ


Management was certainly aware that up to 45% of VIP 
revenue was attributable to the sale of products to PetIQ.


Why was management not forthright about the magnitude 
of their prior business relationship? Why was it mentioned 


only in passing two months after the initial M&A call?


Source


To what extent was VIP a “services business” if close to half of its 
revenue came from product sales just to PetIQ (and even more of its 


revenue from the sale of product to other distributors and/or retailers)?

Mischaracterizing Vendor Relationships?


On its Q1 FY18 earnings call, PetIQ management claimed that just 2% of its distributed product sales were of product sourced through the grey 
market, and that 90% of distributed product sales were sourced through a direct relationship with manufacturers. Management seemed to imply 
that these figures were similar to what they had been prior to the VIP acquisition. This flies in the face of the fact that the Company eliminated 


$111M of FY17 sales upon combining PetIQ with VIP. This would have represented just under half of PetIQ sales in FY17.


PETQ Earnings Call: Q1 FY18


“Hey, Cord, just to kind of clear up a couple of things. Can you let us know for the quarter 
what percentage of your sales or product came from the gray market, and it related to how 
your relationships have changed for better for worse over the past few months with the 
animal health companies in terms of now that you own VIP, is there any way to qualify that?”


- Bill Chappell – SunTrust


“Yes. We've tried to answer this question numerous times over the last few months and I'll try and put it to that 
once and for all…. if you take the isolated items that we distribute where we're supporting animal health manufacturers, 
2% -- less than 2% of our current product that we distribute would be considered secondary sourced or gray 
market as you referenced it.
We would have a little bit less than 8% today based on our Q1 results that would be done through what we're 
calling an authorized distributor. For a designated distributor, where an animal health manufacturer has asked 
us to purchase through a specific distributor partner as their authorized distributor.
The balance of the product that we distribute we have direct relationships with the manufacturers that we are in multi-
year contracts and those terms are significantly better than what they've been historically with the companies. And it 
has put us in a place where we've never had stronger relationships with the company.


So roughly 90% of our distribution business is through a direct relationship with the animal health 
manufacturers. Very different than the rumors or are things that have been implied out in the marketplace 
about how the company is currently being supported.”


- McCord Christensen – CEO, PetIQ


If they actually did “[try] to answer this question numerous times over the last few months,” would their answer have been materially different 
had they actually answered the question prior to the VIP acquisition? It’s interesting that they conveniently decide to answer it only now, after 


having acquired VIP’s direct line to Merial and other manufacturers. Management appears to want to suggest that grey market procurement was 
never a big part of the business, and that they never depended as heavily as they actually did on a single vendor such as VIP.

Where Is The Operating Leverage?


We would expect to see some level of operating leverage in the combined PetIQ-VIP business with the consolidation of shared G&A and inter-
company sales. Yet, even when $111M of zero-margin revenue is eliminated, margins for the combined business appear to be largely flat 


following the acquisition. We question the economic logic of the acquisition given the apparent lack of leverage or demonstrable economic 
synergies between the separate businesses.


At the same time, the Company has experienced material gross margin contraction through FY18, confirming our view that the “opening up” of 
the veterinary pharmaceutical distribution market will pressure the profitability of PetIQ’s products segment.

Declining Value Of Customer Relationships


PetIQ paid $220M for VIP, including a direct payment to VIP management. Of this, goodwill and intangibles represented comprised 100% of the 
purchase price. Despite the acquisition closing in two weeks, PetIQ was still finalizing the allocation of the price months later.


Interestingly, PetIQ wrote down the value of VIP’s customer relationships twice while finalizing the accounting. Does this reflect that PetIQ 
received customer pushback against the deal, perhaps due to its potential anticompetitive effects?


Additional Note
Does this dramatic adjustment to the 


contingent notes, which were tied to EBITDA 
targets, suggest that the deal went south?

Stretching The Amortization Period?


We also note that PetIQ is amortizing its “customer relationships” over an egregiously-long twenty-year period. This stands in contrast to peers 
which amortize acquisition-derived customer relationships over far shorter periods – typically ten years. 


By reducing the value of customer relationships from $90.7M to $76.3M and amortizing over 20 years, PETQ reduced its expense by $700K. 
FY 2018 GAAP earnings were ($782k), so PETQ’s earnings loss would have practically doubled.

Significant Adjustment To Contingent 
Consideration


As part of the VIP acquisition, PetIQ agreed to pay a contingent consideration of $20M ($10M for 2019 and $10M for 2020, based on EBITDA 
targets). Once the acquisition was concluded, the contingent consideration liability was valued at $9.5M. The basis has since been shifted down 


to $2.7M as of year-end FY18.


Does the large adjustment in contingent consideration suggest that something went wrong with the acquisition?

Rebates: A Giant Piece Of The Model


We know that VIP received $21.7M in vendor rebates from veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturers in FY17, and passed along some 
(significant) portion of them to PetIQ. We also know that the combined company’s pro forma FY17 operating income was $15.6M. This is $6M 


less than the total value of VIP’s FY17 rebates!


We assume that PetIQ received additional rebate income from non-VIP vendors. We also assume that VIP contributes some positive non-rebate 
operating profit to the combined company, as it runs its mobile clinics business at better than break-even. Taken together, these facts imply that 


PetIQ’s core product business operates at a significant loss without vendor rebates.


Given that the rebate structure recently changed, and that Merial has begun to bypass the grey market, we wonder how sustainable these 
rebates are, and consequently what multiple investors should pay for these earnings.

All VIP Rebates Payable Owed To PetIQ


Given the magnitude of PetIQ’s relationship with VIP, we suspect that VIP passed on a significant portion of its vendor rebates to PetIQ. 
But did it have similar arrangements with other firms?


We note that, as of Dec 31, 2017, VIP had $2.8M receivables payable outstanding. The entirety of this balance was wiped out through inter-
company eliminations following the acquisition: the full balance was owed to PetIQ.

Why Such Growth In Rebates?


On Apr 2, 2018, management reported rebates up 175%, completely out of line with sales or inventory growth. We find this perplexing and 
concerning given its proximity to the VIP acquisition. Was part of the attraction of the VIP acquisition access to manufacturer rebates, on which 


PetIQ profitability appears to depend so heavily?

VIP Spring Loading Into The PetIQ Acquisition?


We find it perplexing that VIP would be given such attractive terms in the transaction given the relative unattractiveness of its core veterinary 
business, and given the strength of the existing relationship between PetIQ and VIP prior to the acquisition. Concerningly, in conjunction with 


this, we observe a suspicious pattern in pre-acquisition VIP earnings: whereas VIP EBITDA was healthy and in line with historical figures 
through Q1 and Q2 of FY17, it began to contract into Q3 – and filings imply that VIP saw negative EBITDA in Q4, just prior to the acquisition. 


Could VIP have shifted earnings to PetIQ in the form of advantageous pricing or rebates in exchange for an attractive valuation?

A Relationship Facilitated By Merial


Did PetIQ and VIP expand their relationship at Merial’s direction? During a recent presentation, Christensen claimed that he was introduced to 
VIP by Susan Sholtis, and that she had suggested that PetIQ and VIP forge a close relationship. Sholtis was Merial’s Head of North American 
Commercial Operations from 2016-17 – the same period through which VIP rebates spiked, and through which VIP showed rapidly increasing 


customer concentration (with PetIQ). For Merial, creating a more direct line to PetIQ would have meant increasing throughput to the retail 
channel – yet selling to PetIQ through VIP would have also permitted it to maintain the façade of selling only to vets, averting the risk of 


heightened regulatory scrutiny or of threatening its veterinary relationships. A close partnership (or merger) between VIP and PetIQ was the best 
of both worlds for Merial. Merial’s support of such an arrangement would not surprise us: anecdotally, veterinarians report that Merial turned a 


blind eye to grey market diversion through the early to mid 2010s in a similar effort to push retail sales.


Interestingly, Sholtis was named to PetIQ’s board shortly after leaving Merial – and, shortly thereafter, was named President of PetIQ.


Jefferies’ ICR Conference: Jan 15, 2019


“What you don't know is I met VIP Petcare, because Susan, the President 
of Merial said, you need to be with VIP Petcare, because what they're 
doing with and what you're doing will change the industry. So, it's not hard 
that she gets excited when we follow some of those instructions and put the 
piece of the puzzle together to show up and help us execute on that strategy.”

Other Industry Players Suspect A Special 
Relationship With Merial


Other industry players recognize that PetIQ likely undertook the acquisition not for the sake of the veterinary business itself, but to gain access 
to direct relationships with manufacturers – Merial in particular. In Apr 2018, Med Vets, Inc. and Bay Medical Solutions, Inc. – both veterinary 


drug wholesalers – filed suit to block the PetIQ-VIP acquisition, alleging that the deal was designed to create a dominant distributor capable of 
limiting distribution and enforcing price discipline, and that PetIQ would receive preferential pricing from manufacturers such as Merial, which 


would gain greater control over retail distribution through their relationship with the combined PetIQ-VIP business (note that the case was 
recently thrown out). Interestingly, PetIQ gave Merial a security interest in its Q2 FY18 credit agreement, just one quarter after the acquisition, 


perhaps confirming that the acquisition paved the way for a special relationship between PetIQ and Merial.

81


Does Merial Even Need The PetIQ-VIP 
Relationship Anymore?


While Merial may benefit from the PetIQ-VIP relationship so long as it prefers to sell to licensed veterinarians, it and other veterinary drug 
manufacturers have increasingly entertained the possibility of selling directly to retail. In particular, on a number of recent earnings calls, 


PetMed Express (PETS), an online retailer of veterinary medications, has indicated that it is now working towards developing direct supply 
relationships with manufacturers.


To the extent that the now-combined PetIQ-VIP business has an economic “moat,” the source of its competitive advantage is that it is at once a 
licensed veterinarian and distributor of veterinary drugs, giving manufacturers greater access to the retail channel without having to sacrifice 
their (now superficial) policy of selling only into the veterinary channel. Should Merial and other manufacturers no longer feel the need to sell 


only to veterinarians – a direction in which they appear to be moving – what value would the VIP acquisition have brought to PetIQ?

PetIQ Loses Leverage As Merial Goes
Direct To Retail


While PetIQ would appear poised to do more business with Merial and other manufacturers as it facilitates direct-to-retail sales of veterinary 
pharmaceuticals, this new industry model inevitably threatens PetIQ’s competitive positioning and profitability. As manufacturers increasingly 


approach selling directly into the retail channel, the “opening-up” of veterinary drug distribution out of the grey market would invite new 
competitors from the pharmaceutical distribution space which previously were unwilling to participate in the grey market. Further, with 


veterinary drug distribution no longer being routed through veterinarians, both manufacturers and retailers will now have a direct view into 
distributor margins, giving them leverage to squeeze PetIQ profitability.


The murkiness of the grey market, while rendering PetIQ an ethically-dubious business, also likely contributed to PetIQ’s ability to earn 
significantly above-average margins for a pharmaceutical distributor. The opening-up of veterinary drug distribution with manufacturers’ shift 


towards selling more directly to retail seriously threatens PetIQ’s ability to maintain outsized margins.

Conclusion: What Real Value Does The 
Acquisition Generate Today?


The PetIQ-VIP Acquisition: What We Know


1. VIP’s legacy veterinary business and PetIQ’s planned health and wellness centers do not appear to represent an attractive growth opportunity
• VIP’s clinic business seems to have grown organically by only 1.4% in FY18, despite management’s claim of 25% annual growth expectations
• Management sales and contribution margin expectations for its new wellness centers, which are entirely separate from the legacy VIP clinic 


business, are extremely aggressive. At maturity, we expect stores to generate 30% of management’s per-store revenue target, and to generate 
negative earnings vs. management’s targeted 30% contribution margin.


• CONCLUSION: We are skeptical that PetIQ was motivated to acquire VIP for the veterinary clinic / wellness center opportunity


2. A close relationship between PetIQ and VIP allowed PetIQ to generate greater sales and higher margins in its product distribution business
• Buying veterinary drugs through VIP – one of only three nationwide veterinary clinic/hospital businesses – allowed PetIQ to order product in 


size. PetIQ and VIP did $111M of business between them in FY17, representing ~45% of VIP sales and over 50% of PetIQ COGS in FY17.
• Buying in size gave PetIQ access to broader rebates, of which the combined company received $22M in FY17 (vs. operating income of $16M)
• CONCLUSION: PetIQ appears to have acquired VIP for more direct manufacturer relationships and better access to rebates, both of which 


were necessary to support sales and earnings as the business outgrew its prior (dubious) vendor relationships and rebate sources


3. Merial appears to have helped to facilitate the PetIQ-VIP relationship to support retail sales, but may no longer need it
• A close PetIQ-VIP relationship (and, later, their merger) would have allowed Merial to sell product more directly into the retail channel through 


PetIQ, while still maintaining the image of selling only through the veterinary channel
• However, openness to direct sales into the retail channel opens up the industry to pharmaceutical distributors who were previously unwilling 


to participate in the grey market, and gives both manufacturers and retailers a clearer view into distributor margins. Both of these trends 
threaten PetIQ’s outsized margins.


• CONCLUSION: The economics which motivated the VIP acquisition are at risk of being wiped out – and, with it, PetIQ’s outsized profitability. 
PetIQ margins will be pressured as retailers gain visibility into wholesale pricing and distributor margins.


Spruce Point believes that PetIQ acquired VIP to forge more direct relationships with drug manufacturers (Merial in particular) through its new 
veterinary arm, and to gain more direct access to vendor rebates as a result of these relationships. Rebates are a demonstrably significant driver 


of Company earnings, representing over 100% of operating income in the combined PetIQ-VIP business in FY17. It appears that Merial itself 
helped to facilitate the PetIQ-VIP relationship, perhaps to give it a more direct route to the retail channel without having to sidestep 


veterinarians. However, Merial and other veterinary drug manufacturers appear increasingly open to selling directly to retailers.


If PetIQ acquired VIP not for the wellness center growth opportunity – an opportunity which we see as limited at best – but instead for access to 
more direct vendor relationships, what value does the acquisition really bring as Merial and other veterinary drug manufacturers show an 


increasing willingness to sell directly to retail?
Other Concerning Signs
85


Concerning Change In Revenue 
Recognition Policy


We note that PetIQ adjusted its revenue recognition policy materially during FY18 to allow for broader discretion in quantifying revenue. 
In particular, management now uses a “most likely amount method” in its recognition of revenue tied to rebates and discounts, which gives the 


Company an egregious amount of flexibility in determining revenue each period.


The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement 
exists, product has been delivered, the price is fixed or determinable and 
collectability is reasonably assured. The Company generally records revenues 
from product sales when the goods are shipped to the customer. For customers 
with Free on Board ("FOB") destination terms, a provision is recorded to exclude 
shipments estimated to be in-transit to these customers at the end of the reporting 
period. A sales return allowance is recorded and accounts receivable are reduced 
as revenues are recognized for estimated losses on credit sales due to customer 
claims for discounts, returned goods and other items.


Previous Revenue Recognition Policy


Revenue is recognized for product sales on a point in time basis when product 
control is transferred to the customer. In general, control transfers to the customer 
when the product is shipped or delivered to the customer based upon applicable 
shipping terms, as the customer can direct the use and obtain substantially all of 
the remaining benefits from the asset at this point in time.

Tax Distributions A Financing Item?


The Company is structured as a holding company with ownership of underlying LLC interests. Accordingly, it incurs tax liabilities on 
distributions of taxable income from the LLC. However, management treats “Tax Distributions to Continuing LLC Owners” as a financing cash 


outflow rather than an operating cash outflow. These tax distributions represent tax owed on the normal operation of the business and, as such, 
should be treated as an operating cash outflow. As a result, FY 2018 operating cash burn would have increased from ($12.5)M to ($14.0)M.

Constant Redefining Of Adjusted EBITDA


Management has adjusted its definition of adjusted EBITDA on an almost quarterly basis. Rarely do we see management teams make such 
frequent adjustments to proprietary financial metrics. In particular, we believe that PetIQ’s store opening costs and “non-same-store” revenue 


and costs – revenue and costs associated with what management deems to be immature stores – should not be adjusted out of EBITDA, as they 
represent necessary costs required to carry out its wellness center expansion strategy.


Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on debt extinguishment, management fees, stock based 
compensation expense, and litigation expenses.


Q3 FY17


Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus loss on debt extinguishment, management fees, stock based 
compensation expense, acquisition expenses, and litigation expenses.


Q4 FY17


Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus management fees, stock based compensation expense, acquisition 
expenses, and purchase accounting adjustments, fair value adjustments to contingent notes, integration 
costs and costs of discontinued clinics, and new clinic launch expense.


Q1 FY18


Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus management fees, stock based compensation expense, acquisition 
expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, fair value adjustments to contingent notes, integration costs and 
costs of discontinued clinics, loss on clinics and wellness centers that are not part of the same store sales 
[4Q lookback], and new clinic launch expense [and royalty adjustment].


Q2 FY18


Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus management fees, stock based compensation expense, acquisition 
expenses, purchase accounting adjustments, fair value adjustments to contingent notes, integration costs and 
costs of discontinued clinics, loss on clinics and wellness centers that are not part of the same store sales [6Q 
lookback, plus “host partners”], and new clinic launch expense.

Widening Gap Between GAAP And 
Non-GAAP EBITDA


It’s a hallmark of companies covered by Spruce Point to show a widening gap between GAAP Earnings and Adjusted Earnings. We see precisely 
the same phenomenon occurring at PetIQ: Company adjustments to EBITDA are growing ever-larger, accounting for just under half of Adj. 


EBITDA in FY18. Note that these adjustments will likely grow even more significant through the coming years as wellness center buildout ramps 
up, and as management adds back associated one-time store opening costs.


The fact that Adj. EBITDA growth does not translate into cash flow confirms to us that management’s proprietary definition is not a meaningful 
measure of Company performance.

Shifting Growth Targets


While PetIQ’s growth target was initially set at 20%, this figure was gradually tracked back to 15% without much explanation, and without any 
announcement that its growth estimate had changed. In fact, management attempted to communicate that its growth targets hadn’t moved at all.


And then, looking out to 2018 and then maybe even beyond that, do you still feel comfortable 
with the 20% sales growth that you shared during the IPO process?


Q3 FY17


We've just completed what is a six-week process we go through for both a bottom up and a top 
down for every item and every customer. We still stand by our growth targets for the future and 
don't have any updates to those targets at this point for next year.

PetIQ Didn’t Operate Its Utah Plant, Despite 
Suggesting Otherwise


Despite stating that it operated its Springville, UT plant, Spruce Point finds that it was in fact operated by a third party at the time of the IPO. A 
search on the SQF Certified Site Directory does not show any PetIQ facilities. Instead, the directory lists HBH Enterprises (dba Ballard 


Manufacturing) as the operator of the facility. PetIQ acquired this entity last October for $16M.


The Company cited its “manufacturing capabilities” and related expertise as a competitive strength in its S-1 filing. We wonder just how much of 
a competitive advantage this really is if PetIQ did not operate some of its own facilities, contrary to management claims.


We operate facilities in Daytona Beach, Florida and Springville, Utah. Our 
facility in Daytona Beach, Florida engages in, among other things, packaging 
services for products produced by others that we distribute. Our facility in 
Springville, Utah manufactures certain of our proprietary value-branded pet 
treats, such as Delightibles, Betsy Farms jerky treats, VetIQ pill treats and 
wellness supplements.


S-1 Filed Jun 23, 2017


Being first to market has allowed us to gain significant scale and expertise, 
as well as complete the time consuming and costly process of obtaining the 
FDA and EPA registrations necessary to have Rx medications available in the 
retail channel. We believe that through product development, manufacturing 
capabilities, distribution and retail execution we have enabled retailers to enter 
and grow the market for high quality pet medications.

Note that, the price decline in late Apr 2019, it appears as though HBH blew out of the stock as soon as the lockup date passed.

Sell-Side Buy Ratings Impervious To Stock Price


Sell-side analysts have never rated PetIQ anything other than a buy / outperform. Even as share prices peaked at around $43 in Sep 2018 –
surpassing most analyst price targets at the time – the sell side never walked back its buy recommendations. Of course, these are the same 


banks which have helped PetIQ to raise equity since the Company first went public. Management has said that future capital raises, if necessary, 
would likely come in the form of stock issuances rather than borrowing. What bank would risk shutting itself out of future business with PetIQ?

Trading At An Unjustified Premium


PetIQ shares currently trade at a 140% premium to pharmaceutical distributors on both FY20 earnings and FY20 EBITDA due to its historically 
superior margins and Street expectations of 15-20% top-line growth through the near-to-medium term. The stock also trades at a significant 


premium to other names in the pet care space. However, we note that, when the wellness center rollout is modeled more realistically, projected 
Company sales growth falls to just 9-11% when the Street’s implied expectations for product revenue growth are kept in place. While relatively 
slow service revenue growth will not materially cut into earnings estimates until FY21, we also note that PetIQ earnings are not of high quality: 
Company profitability relies heavily on vendor rebates, which could easily be cut or disappear with a shift in manufacturer strategy – like that 


which we are beginning to observe now.


Why should PetIQ shares trade at more than double pharmaceutical distributor multiples when near-term sales growth is more likely to be 9-
11% than 15-20%, and when the Company’s outsized margins appear to depend entirely on at-risk vendor rebates?

Aggressive Earnings Adjustments Artificially 
Deflate Valuation Multiples


Even as PetIQ shares trade at a dramatic premium to peers in both the pharmaceutical distributor space and pet care space, Company 
adjustments to earnings and EBITDA give the stock the appearance of being valued less expensively than it would be valued on a more 


reasonable definition of earnings. Management adjusts both EBITDA and net income for expenses related to the launch of its new wellness 
centers, as well as for “non-same-store” revenue and costs – i.e. revenue and costs associated with centers <18 months old. Spruce Point has 


never seen a company adjust for such items and strongly believes that they should not be adjusted out of earnings: wellness center startup 
costs and losses from immature stores represent necessary implementation costs of PetIQ’s growth strategy and, as such, cannot be ignored.

Note that the magnitude of management’s EBITDA adjustments will only grow over time. In particular, with new wellness center openings set to 
reach 200-300 per year in FY21-23, and with each new wellness center incurring one-time opening expenses of $70K, new clinic launch expenses 


could approach $15-20M within 3-5 years.

Spruce Point Sees 75-90% Downside In PETQ


Even taking management’s implied product sales guidance as given, we see 8% downside to management’s total FY20 sales guidance due to 
disappointing wellness center performance. We also see downside to pre-adjustment EBITDA against the Street’s overly-optimistic view of 


product gross margins: even assuming segment GM expansion to 17% in our bull case, we see 40% downside to pre-adjustment EBITDA, and 
60% downside assuming flat segment GMs. Once management’s likely FY20 EBITDA adjustments are taken into account – which we believe 


should not be applied to EBITDA – we see 47-65% downside to management’s implied FY20 Adjusted EBITDA.


Valuing PETQ shares on-par with – or even at a slight premium to – peers in the pharmaceutical distribution and pet care spaces yields 75-90% 
downside to current levels. We believe that such a valuation could in fact be generous, as PetIQ’s rebate-driven earnings are of particularly low 


quality, and as changes to the veterinary pharmaceutical supply chain should pressure PetIQ’s product gross margins. Accordingly, PETQ 
shares could deserve a materially below-average multiple given the downside risks to Company earnings.
