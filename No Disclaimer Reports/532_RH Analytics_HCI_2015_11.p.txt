HCI Group: Patel Admits Game Over
Mar. 9, 2015 10:54 AM ET2 comments
by: RH Analytics


Summary


Adjusted for the assumption, policy count and gross premiums declined -4.6% and
-3.1%, respectively.


The era of takeout driven growth appears to be coming to a close, leaving the
company at a loss as to how to deliver value.


What happens to a growth company when it doesn't grow?


The HCI Group's (NYSE:HCI) 4Q14 conference call was more interesting and dramatic
than expected. As anticipated, the company delivered reasonable results and an outlook
clouded by uncertainty. The big surprise in the quarter was Mr. Patel's statement that
implied the company's takeout-driven growth model is dead. We believe that absent
subsidy supported takeout growth, HCI will experience significant financial decline.


When Mr. Patel was asked about what the company might do when takeouts are no
longer available, he responded "that's not some point in time, I think we are pretty much
there now". The certainty with which the statement was made was also surprising, and
makes us wonder if the problem is a lack of policies or the lack of access to the policies. In
any case, assuming Mr. Patel is correct, this marks the beginning of the end, in our view.


There are two basic arguments regarding HCI's ability to deliver returns to shareholders in
the absence of takeouts. The first argument is the long-tail revenue stream or steady-state
earnings argument we have heard some analysts cite. As we have demonstrated in
previous research, history shows that without results fortified with subsidies from
assumptions, HCI's policy count and financial results decay. Despite the continued tail-
winds from lower reinsurance pricing, 4Q14 is a good illustration on how erosion starts.


When queried on the policy count, Mr. Patel gave the very precise answer of 177,360. OIR
documents indicate that HCI assumed 36,448 policies in December. The churn
implications for the quarter are calculated below.

Source: OIR, 4Q14 transcript and estimates.


We estimate that churn for 4Q14 was -4.6% on an adjusted basis, which implies an
annualized rate of -17.2%. The revenue impact was masked by assumed premiums.
Quarter over quarter gross premiums grew $2.5M to $91.4M from $88.9M in 3Q14.
However, on the call, HCI said that the assumption contributed $5.3M in gross premiums
in the quarter. Adjusting for assumptions, gross premiums actually declined ($2.8M) or
-3.1% in the quarter to $86.1M.


This dynamic of 15%-20% churn and attending premium erosion is what we expect to
define HCI's financials going forward without assumptions. Further, we expect negative
operating leverage from sticky operating expenses to compress margins, compounding
the problem of a shrinking top-line.


We consider churn in the quarter a significant negative surprise. On the 2Q14 conference
call, management stated that absent an assumption they would have organic growth of
300-400 policies a week in 4Q14, which implies total quarterly growth of 3,600-4,800
policies. In our read of the text, we expected a 4,000 policy gain excluding an assumption,
but the reality was churn of -6,825 for a total delta of 10,825 or 7.3% of the 3Q14 total
policy base. Perhaps management meant things differently, but we view it as a significant
deviation from expectations and believe others do as well.


The second argument to counteract the lack of assumption-driven growth is growth via
'diversification'. Some Florida firms, such as United Insurance (NASDAQ:UIHC), Universal
Insurance (NYSEMKT:UVE) and to a lesser degree, Federated National
(NASDAQ:FNHC), have begun underwriting in other states. HCI and Heritage Insurance
(NYSE:HRTG) have not made the leap. On the call, Mr. Patel stated that HCI will not
underwrite elsewhere, (although they have in the past); they intend on diversifying outside
of insurance. In other words, HCI plans on using shareholder cash to transform itself into
the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) of Tampa. We call this the 'trust us
to make money with your money' model.

In our opinion, if HCI cannot deploy capital in their core business, they should return it to
shareholders. If shareholders want to invest outside of insurance, they can do so in
vehicles with appropriate management teams. Further, HCI has already attempted to
diversify into other lines. The company has made forays into selling insurance in Alabama,
flood insurance in Florida as well as software and coastal real estate. As far as we can
tell, none of these efforts have benefited shareholders in any measurable way.


Two other issues discussed on the call caught our attention. Mr. Patel discussed
reinsurance coverage in the context of takeouts, a commentary we believe was directed at
RH Analytics. Mr. Patel said that our 'flying naked' supposition "isn't really true" and that
policies are covered in the event of a spring storm. Unfortunately, his ambiguous language
did not provide any real clarity on the issue and questions remain.


Reinsurance documents for Florida insurers can be very difficult to obtain. Many insurers,
HCI and UVE among them, use Florida trade secret laws to keep documents out of the
public domain. It appears as if the practice is encouraged by the Florida Office of
Insurance Regulation, OIR. As can be seen here, the OIR legal team makes presentations
that seem to be designed to educate insurers on how to keep documents out of the public
domain. We find the OIR's behavior perplexing given its role as the protector of the
public's interests.


Nothing facilitates understanding like transparency. We urge HCI and the OIR alike to
adopt policies that illuminate rather than obscure this critical dimension of Florida's
insurance industry.


The second point we found interesting was the discussion regarding the profitability of
wind-only policies. When queried on the topic, Mr. Patel gave a long-winded, indefinite
answer. Mr. Patel did not want to commit to a profitability estimate for the policies because
"the volatility associated with the reinsurance contracts on those policies will be so great"
and pricing will depend on how the policies fit with the rest of the book. We agree with
both statements.


In short, HCI does not have a clear picture of the margins on wind-policies because they
do not know what the costs will be. We would suggest that while the policies may be
marginally profitable, if history is a guide, there is also a reasonable chance that they are
unprofitable. In our view, management's lack of clarity on expected performance
underscores our contention that the book has a negative risk-reward profile.
