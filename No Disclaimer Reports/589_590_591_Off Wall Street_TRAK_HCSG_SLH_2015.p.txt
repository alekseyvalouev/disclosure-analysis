INTERVIEW


The Best Bets of a Stellar Short Seller


Mark Roberts started Off Wall Street Consulting Group in May 1990. In the years since, his Cambridge,


Mass.–based team has cranked out hundreds of well-researched investment ideas for his money-


manager clients—mostly on the short side, probing stocks it thinks will decline. Roberts has shared his


ideas with Barron’s readers from time to time, and they usually pan out. He highlighted several in a


recent conversation.


Barron’s: You’ve got an anniversary that you’ll be celebrating.


Roberts: We started May 1, 1990, so this is the 25th anniversary of Off Wall Street. We just launched a


new Website: offwallstreet.com. We are the longest-surviving company of our kind.


What has your record been in that time?


Since we started, we have recommended 450 positions. We’ve closed just under 80% with gains and


the balance with losses. And we’ve done better than the inverse of the Standard & Poor's 500 index

every year. We publish about 20 short-sale recommendations in a year, and maybe four or five Buy


recommendations. In the past 20 years, we have outperformed the inverse of the S&P 500 by an


average of 18.4 percentage points per year.


Tell us one of your current ideas.


The auto sector has been hot for a


long time, and it has given us some


good short opportunities.


DealerTrack Technologies is one.


This company [ticker: TRAK] had a


good business when it started in


2001. It provides a network to


connect financing sources and auto


dealers. When you ping the


financiers with your credit


application, they get a fee.


How has that business been doing?


It is experiencing a strong period now. It is a cyclical business, tied not only to car sales but credit


availability. If you are a subprime borrower, you are pinging more lenders than you would with a prime


credit application. But that business is near a cyclical peak in terms of credit availability and auto sales.


Why do bulls like Dealertrack’s prospects?

Starting about 2005-’06, the company began acquiring other software companies in the auto area.


The bull case is that now they are a big, integrated suite of products, a SAAS [“software as a service”]


company. Our short thesis is really about this subscription software business. Since we started to write


about this two years ago, they’ve been promising that the subscription software business would be


accelerating growth. That never happened.


At the end of 2013, they made a big bet and paid a billion dollars to buy a company called Dealer.com. It


provides Websites for auto dealers, which is a saturated business. They also have an advertising


business, essentially a digital advertising firm. Dealer.com struck a number of deals with auto makers


to provide advertising services for them. We spoke with people in the industry who believe that the


economics on that business are poor and that Dealer.com struck a lot of these deals just to show


revenue growth before shopping themselves as an acquisition.


What about Dealertrack’s earnings quality?


Dealertrack focuses investors’ attention on the revenue line, but there are distortions. The revenue


reported in its advertising segment is gross revenue–effectively, the dollars clients spend to buy


advertising, not the dollars that Dealer.com or Dealertrack keep as a fee. It gets passed through as


zero-margin revenue. And the fees the company receives for providing these advertising services are


put in the subscription software segment, making it look like software revenue growth has accelerated


a bit.


How have cash profit margins been?


Before they started making all these acquisitions, their cash returns on invested capital were in the


high teens, low twenties. Now they’re about 2%.


Their cash flow has been really, really poor. They’ve accelerated the extent to which they capitalize


expenses. They like to point to adjusted Ebitda [earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and


amortization] as their preferred measure of profitability, but that measure is essentially meaningless,

given their hefty capital expenditures. The net result is that Dealertrack generated 43 cents a share in


sustainable cash flow last year. At $38.44 a share, the stock is trading for about 90 times. Our target


price is $27.


Your other auto name is Solera Holdings.


Solera [SLH] was created in 2005. If you get into an accident, they have a database to estimate how


much it is going to cost to fix your car. Some 60% of their business is still insurance claims—auto


claims, mostly. They’ve also made a few large acquisitions. The bull case is that this is a diversified


information-services company–with very high margins and very sticky insurance customers–that can


go out and acquire products and cross-sell them into the insurers.


Our short thesis is, first, the secular decline in auto


collisions and auto claims, which is going to get worse in


the next few years. In developed markets, collision


volumes are falling in the low-to-mid-single digits year-


over-year. The main reason is safety technology: Thirty


percent of all collisions take place when someone is


backing up. So the back-up cameras have had a


substantial effect on reducing these collisions. That will


be joined by collision-avoidance systems, lane-change


warnings, and blind-spot monitors.


Have bulls responded to your arguments?


Yes. So now the pitch is: “They’re going to be able to overcome this by increasing price and by cross-


selling new products.”


We think they are going to have trouble doing that for two reasons. First, management has a track


record of making big promises without delivering. They talk a lot about new products coming out, but


our research suggests that they have really underinvested in those areas. Second is competition. The


U.S. claims business is already competitive, but in the European business they were almost a


monopoly. But there are new competitors coming in recently, offering prices on estimates that are in


some cases 50% lower.


There is also a quality-of-earnings issue here. They exclude something called “contingent purchase


consideration deemed to be compensatory” from their adjusted earnings. That is the salaries you pay


people in the acquired companies, so it’s a cash expense, not part of the consideration for the business


you bought. It looks like they are leaning on this more and more to report a good “adjusted earnings”


number. In the fiscal year ended June 2012, this contingent purchase consideration was six cents a


share. In fiscal ’13, it was 16 cents a share. In fiscal ’14, it was 27 cents a share. If you back that out,


earnings would have declined from $2.64 in fiscal ’12 to $2.56 in fiscal ’13, then to $2.49 in fiscal ’14.

Where might the stock go?


The stock is at $50.69. Our present target is $39, which is about 20 times the trailing sustainable free


cash flow of $1.93, which is reasonable given the issues that they are facing.


Thank you. What else have you got?


Healthcare Services Group [HCSG]. It is $32.63. Our target is $16, and that is 18 times our 2015


estimate of 87 cents.


You’ve had this name out there for a while.


About two years, maybe a little more. The company is an outsourcer of housekeeping, laundry, and


dietary services to the healthcare industry, mostly nursing homes and rehab centers. It missed


[earnings expectations] in most of the past five quarters, and has a poor quality of earnings. But the


multiple just keeps going up. When we first put the idea out, the multiple was in the mid-20s. Now it


trades at about 34 times earnings.


Why are investors so indulgent, or optimistic?


This is a company with a good balance sheet: $87 million in cash and no debt. It services the health-


care industry, which has secular growth characteristics. Many nursing homes run on extremely low


margins, so there’s incentive for them to cut costs however they can.


Our argument is that this company has poor contract terms. Their typical term is about one year and it


is cancelable after 30 to 90 days. These customers are undergoing financial stress, so there is


significant risk of underpayment or no payment at all.


Is there evidence of that customer stress?


The recently issued 10-K had a lot of evidence. In terms of having difficulty collecting from customers,


the accounts receivable in bankruptcy or litigation went up 140% year over year. From $6 million in


2013, it is up to almost $15 million in 2014.


And they perform a strange conversion on accounts receivable. When a customer falls behind, they


convert some of those receivables to a promissory note. We track the impaired promissory notes. The


impaired notes receivable rose 250% year-over-year in 2014, from $2.9 million to $10.2 million. As a


percentage of gross notes receivable, it went from 16% to 51%. This is suggestive of a client base


feeling the strain.


This is a company that over time has seen its profitability decline. In 2007 they had 8% operating profit


margins and as of the latest quarter, only 5.3% operating margins.


What about a long idea?

Crown Holdings [CCK] is a stock you can hold for your grandkids. This is our second recommendation.


We originally recommended it around $30, a few years ago. We booked a nice profit. Then they made


an acquisition that I really like, so we got back in about a year ago, at around $41. The stock is now


$51.80.


That’s close to your $55 target, right?


Yep, but the target is moving up. Crown produces more than 60 billion metal cans a year, primarily


beverage and food cans. Most of the growth has been on the beverage side, which has favorable tail


winds.


Crown operates in oligopoly markets with substantial barriers to entry, typically two or three players in


each market. It generates high returns on capital and strong, predictable free cash flow. It takes that


cash flow and reinvests it into new plants, accretive acquisitions, and share repurchases. It has


reduced the share count by 20% just in the past seven years, despite a massive investment program at


the same time.


Since 2009, they’ve built out a considerable footprint in Southeast Asia, China, and Brazil. These are all


high-growth markets for beverage consumption. They’ve added 16 billion cans of annual capacity. They


are a preferred supplier to regional and the multinational companies.


In October 2014 Crown acquired a company called Mivisa, a manufacturer of specialty food cans in


Spain. It was very successful for decades, with extremely high margins. Just last month, Crown bought


Empaque, the leading Mexican producer of beer cans.


And Ball [BLL], one of the industry’s behemoths, just made a deal for another behemoth, Rexam


[REX.UK]. If the transaction takes place, it will be favorable for industry pricing. More important, Ball


will have to divest itself of some prized assets, and Crown is the logical buyer.


Where can the stock go?


Two years ago, I pitched the private market value for this company at about $90 a share. Free cash


flow could hit $5.40 in 2017, and the stock could double in four years. I see the stock getting to the low


$60s in the next year.
