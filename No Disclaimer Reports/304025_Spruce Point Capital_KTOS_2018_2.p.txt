Spruce Point Reiterates Strong Sell On Kratos, 
Downgrades View On Reduced Free Cash Flow


Based on recent Q1’2018 results, Spruce Point is incrementally more negative on Kratos (Nasdaq: KTOS), and 


continues to call for its CEO and CFO to resign immediately given mounting evidence of potentially deceptive 


free cash flow guidance and cash reporting. We see fair value at $3.15 to $6.30 per share (45% to 75% downside)


1) Adjusted For A Change In Accounting Principle, Which Was 4x Bigger Than Disclosed Less Than 


Three Months Ago, Kratos Q1 Revenues Missed Expectations By 6%


2) Kratos Operating Income Performance Was Aided By Unexplained Decline In Depreciation (Notably 


In Its Promoted Unmanned System (Drone)) Segment, Despite Ramp In Capex Spending


3) Kratos Q2’2018 Revenue Guidance of $140 to $150m Also Fell Short of Expectations for 


$154 million


4) In A Potentially Deceptive Manner, Kratos Reduced Its Normalized Free Cash Flow Guidance 


For 2018 By 36% to 58%


5) New Anomalies In Kratos Financials Call Into Question The Accuracy of Its Cash Balances


6) Kratos Trades At An Irrational 163x Free Cash Flow Estimates Despite Revenue Disappointments, 


A New High In DSO, And Evidence That Suggests Management Is Using Deceptive Free Cash 


Flow Forecasts


7) Kratos Would Be Worthless If Given An Industry Free Cash Flow Multiple. Giving Them The Benefit 


of The Doubt, It Is Very Easy To Justify 45% to 75% Downside Risk

Kratos Q1 Result In A Large Revenue Miss 
Pro Forma For Revenue Accounting Change


Pay very close attention to Kratos results for Q1’2018 which benefited from the adoption of ASU 2014-09 relating to 


revenue recognition. In Kratos’ 10-K Annual Report filed in Feb 2018, it said it did not expect the accounting change to 


be material, yet given footnote disclosure in the recently filed 10-Q, the impact was very material – 4x larger to 


revenues. Instead of a fractional miss to revenue expectations, Kratos missed expectations by approximately 6%. 


Kratos also offered Q2’18 revenue guidance of $140 to $150m vs. $154m – suggesting further disappointment

Kratos on New Revenue Accounting Change (2017 10-K, F-17, Feb 28, 2018): “Based upon an assessment of material active contracts as of 
December 31, 2017, the Company has determined that the impact on the results of operations and cash flows upon adoption are not material. The 


Company also does not expect the impact in the periods after adoption to be material.….The Company expects the cumulative effect of adopting ASU 


2014-09 to result in an increase in revenue of less than $2 million and an increase in operating income of less than $2 million. These changes 


principally reflect the impact of converting contracts applying the units-of-delivery under the old revenue guidance to the cost-to-cost method of 


accounting. The cumulative effect of adoption of the new revenue guidance will be recognized as an increase in contract assets, a reduction in 


inventoried costs, an increase in contract liabilities and a net decrease in accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2018.”

Operating Margin Improvement By 
Questionable Depreciation Decline


Kratos is touting its significant improvement in operating income, and specifically its improved performance in its 


hyped Unmanned Systems (US or drone) business. However, digging beneath the surface we find an unexplained 


decline in depreciation and amortization year-over-year. (1) The biggest percentage decline of 50% was in Unmanned 


Systems segment. This result makes little sense given that Capex is now running higher than depreciation, and the 


majority of the Capex is focused on growing the Unmanned System business. The result is unlikely to be explained 


by the divestiture of PSS which carried very little depreciation and amortization expense.

Downgrading Kratos On Reduction in 
Continuing Free Cash Flow Guidance


Pay very close attention to Kratos new guidance disclosure. Kratos added one sentence that discloses that 


cash flow forecasts include $7m of working capital proceeds from the sale of its Public Safety and Security 


business. This is a non-recurring source of cash flow and should not be factored into the forward valuation 


of its share price. On a continuing basis, Kratos continuing free cash flow guidance is a meager $5 to $12m

financial guidance of positive cash flow generation from operations of $35 to $45 million, including the 


expected collection of net working capital proceeds of the PSS business retained by Kratos.”

CFO Potentially Misleading Kratos Investors 
And Analysts About The PSS Sale Impact?


The CFO of Kratos explicitly stated last quarter that guidance excluded results of PSS. Furthermore, when 


asked directly by an analyst and given the opportunity to provide clarity about the working capital 


assumptions behind the forecast, she still failed to mention that the cash flow guidance included $7m from 


the PSS divestiture. We believe this is a material omission.


CFO Lund Response To Herbert Fails To Address PSS: “So some of the rest are there is some flight milestones 


that need to occur on some of the Unmanned programs which just doing part arrange time to get on to certain ranges 


that Ken delayed that milestones so that's one of the risks some of the other ones we don’t really see as risky 


because they are just really hitting certain performance metrics that are in our control which obviously that the flights 


on range time those are not totally in our control. From a working capital requirement prospective we do expect some 


use in working capital as we continue to grow the business but that some of that is offset in the cash flow guidance 


that we given with some of that milestone that we do expect and to collect. Some of these milestones are milestones 


we had expected in the second half of '17 and they have moved into '18 to some of them we do expect to see some 


in the first half of '18.”


Analyst Herbert Q4’17 Call (Feb 2018): “Eric and Deanna, I really appreciate all the detail. I just wonder Deanna 


really I mean the guidance calls very significant improvement in cash from operations and free cash flow for the full-


year. I know you went through some of this, but how will you characterize maybe the risk to that 40 million in cash 


from operations at the midpoint for 2018? And maybe just a little more detail on specifically, what you assume 


working capital and some of the other key pieces to provide?”


CFO Lund on Q4’17 Call (Feb 2018): “Accordingly today we are providing initial guidance for the first quarter and 


full-year 2018 reflecting PSS as a discontinued operation. Kratos' PSS business was forecast to achieve full-year 


2018 revenues and adjusted EBITDA before corporate overhead of approximately $140 to $159 and $9 million to $12 


million respectively. PSS generated full-year 2017 revenues and adjusted EBITDA excluding the allocated corporate 


overhead cost of $149 million and $6.9 million respectively. As the result of the pending sale Kratos' Q1 2018 and 


full-year financial guidance provided today excludes PSS as those all other financial information covered.”

Evidence To Suggest Deficient Cash Controls, 
Potential Misrepresentation of Cash Balances


Kratos reported negative proceeds from the issuance of stock in its cash flow statement. Kratos does not have 


an active share repurchase program, so it is unlikely this is an error in labeling. Furthermore, in Note 6 to the 


equity accounts, it has a zero balance for Q1’18 stock issuance. We conclude that at best deficient controls in 


Kratos cash management exist, and at worse cash is being misrepresented or inaccurately reported.

More Cash Anomalies: Negative Cash…


Negative cash balance at Public Safety and Security (PSS)?


Spruce Point has never seen a business with a mathematically impossible financial account.


We believe that PSS has likely over-drafted its accounts and has greater liabilities than liquid cash resources

DSO’s To Fresh Highs


Kratos Days Sales Outstanding (DSO) spiked to a new high this quarter. We believe this is more evidence 


that cash flow remains strained and will disappoint investors.

Kratos Valued Irrationally On 
Meager Continuing Free Cash Flow


Kratos $1.2 billion enterprise value relative to its $5 to $12 million of 2018E free cash flow this year makes little 


sense to us, especially in light of the fact that management appears to not be forthright about the guidance, 


and to have cash management control issues. Best-of-breed aerospace and defense peers with more 


consistent free cash flow that pay dividends and repurchases shares trade at an average of 25x and not 163x

Kratos’ assets have historically traded between 0.7x

below book value because it still has not

Even giving Kratos the benefit of the doubt it can

(despite evidence of potential cash and free cash

We downgrade our free cash flow target to remove 
the non-continuing portion from the sale of the PSS 
business. If Kratos were valued at an industry peer 
multiple (commensurate with peers that generate 


consistent free cash flow, pay dividends and 
repurchase shares), Kratos stock would be 


worthless. Even giving them the benefit of a 2x 
industry multiple we estimate 65% downside
