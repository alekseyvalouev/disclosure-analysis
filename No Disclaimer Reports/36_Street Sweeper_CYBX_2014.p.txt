Shock Factor: Cyberonics Link To Death, Injury Reports
Apr. 16, 2014 2:36 PM ET4 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


The FDA reporting system shows over 10,000 deaths and injuries were reported as
"adverse events" that may be linked to the company's medical device.


Plagued by Medicare’s decision to deny coverage of its anti-depression device
multiple times; the door to the depression space has slammed shut on Cyberonics.


A false claims complaint filed against Cyberonics poses significant risk if the
government takes it further, as we believe it should.


Exciting, new treatments – even non-invasive ones - threaten the VNS position.


Difficult-to-treat epilepsy patient base is small. Demand for VNS replacement units is
declining.


By Sonya Colberg, Senior Investigative Reporter


Judy Bowling could easily complete the night shift at a New York medical clinic, drive the
20-mile commute back home, yank off her favorite green scrubs and grab a few hours of
sleep. After school, the single mom and her young daughter would often jump in the car
so the child could spend the night with Ms. Bowling's parents, giving the two some
cherished "girl time" during the drive.


But life changed radically after Ms. Bowling had a "VNS" (vagus nerve stimulation) device
by Houston, Texas-based Cyberonics (NASDAQ:CYBX) implanted inches above her heart
to try to control her epileptic seizures with tiny electric shocks transmitted to the brain.


She is one of thousands of patients who have been implanted with the device that Dr.
Peter Barglow terms, "completely worthless."


"I'd never dream of subjecting anyone to that sort of nonsense," said Dr. Barglow, an MD
with more than five decades in the psychiatry field, now handling a busy practice in
Berkeley, Calif. After extensive examination of the issue and VNS studies, he said he
considers any association with VNS irrational.


In Ms. Bowling's case, the seizures became worse, and she quickly spiraled downward
both physically and mentally.

Ms. Bowling's experience is one of more than 9,000 Cyberonics-linked injury reports
submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration from 1998 to this month. The
manufacturer is mandated to investigate the reports to determine links to its medical
implant.


In fact, more than 1,980 Cyberonics-linked death reports were uncovered in our
investigation.


These "adverse events" resulted from the device made and touted by a company
staggering beneath two extensive FDA warning letters and targeted by a US Senate
investigation over effectiveness and safety concerns springing from its FDA approval
process. And the heat's still on in the form of a false claims lawsuit that we believe the
government should move forward.


Losing it: In the institution


Ms. Bowling had to fold up her scrubs and place her 10-year-old daughter under the
temporary care of her parents. With that pocket watch-sized VNS device still pulsing in her
body, Ms. Bowling then found herself shuffled from psychiatric hospital to psychiatric
hospital. Often she arrived as a screaming, writhing ball of fury, bound in a five-point
restraint from which she says she learned to escape.


"It was a nightmare," she said with a nervous laugh. "Like something you see on TV."


By then, her mother had already told Judy's big sister, Nancy Bowling, that she felt certain
the personality changes were caused by the VNS device. She investigated and became
convinced the problem was indeed that device shooting tiny electric shocks into her
sister's brain.


Judy Bowling settled into what would become her final, five-month stay at a psychiatric
hospital. In New York's Rockland Psychiatric Center - an institution she now remembers
fondly - the normally mild, disciplined then-45-year-old woman manipulated and fought for
her place in the inmate pecking order.


One day, an 18-year-old inmate made fun of the way she looked in the throes of a seizure.
Ms. Bowling stood up to her and the teenager threw a punch. Ms. Bowling flew into the
toughie who had been known to enjoy a good street fight now and then. Fists flew. Feet
kicked. Hands grabbed.


The street fighter grabbed a chunk of Ms. Bowling's glossy blond locks. And another. And,
while keeping her own hair out of Ms. Bowling's reach, yet another handful.

"She pulled out half my hair!" said Ms. Bowling, now 50.


Nancy Bowling insisted that the neurologist (who has not responded to
TheStreetSweeper's request for comment) authorize removal of the VNS device that the
family suspected caused Judy Bowling's uncharacteristic behavior.


But he was reluctant because he thought it didn't cause her problems. In fact, February
2009 documentation shows it took a congressman's interest to convince the neurologist to
authorize removal of the device.


At that point, Judy Bowling's surgeon immediately removed the VNS device.


Beating "the devil": Medical literature describes VNS link to psychotic behavior


Medical literature contains cases that point toward a link between VNS and the onset or
worsening of psychosis.


A hospital admitted a 38-year-old epileptic patient claiming he was the devil. He had tried
to cut his own throat because he believed he heard the voice of God urging him to kill
himself.


The VNS inside him pumped out a few seconds' electrical charges every five minutes,
according to his doctors' medical report.


Just three months earlier, doctors had surgically implanted the device. He'd had mental
issues previously that he'd overcome but after surgery his mental state hit the boiling
point. Psych ward doctors tried anti-psychotic drugs over five months to try to break his
psychotic state. To no avail.


Desperate doctors combed the medical literature and found 11 published cases of VNS
inducing or aggravating psychosis. On their suggestion, the neurologist repeatedly
reduced the VNS pulse rate, a simple procedure using a computer.


"The improvement in his condition following each reduction in VNS pulse intensity was
swift and dramatic," doctors wrote.


"Only adjusting the VNS pulse intensity brought relief," they reported.


His improvement was so startling, doctors signed papers authorizing the patient to move
to a halfway house to begin his transition back into society.


FDA's bizarre approval sets device free in the marketplace

We've found the Cyberonics reports describe more than 10,000 deaths, injuries and
equipment malfunctions. These are "adverse event reports" filed in the FDA's "MAUDE"
online reporting system. These reports represent events that may be linked to VNS as well
as some that occurred in VNS patients with other medical issues that make establishing a
VNS link more difficult. Anyone knowledgeable about an adverse event, from doctors and
medical facilities to patients and family members, may file a report here.


An FDA spokeswoman said in an email that the medical device reports are just one of
several post-market data sources.


"As such, the FDA evaluates each situation on a case-by-case basis, considering a variety
of factors to determine whether additional analysis or action may be needed for a
particular device," she said.


So how did the device get FDA approval?


The VNS first got approval in 1997 for use in difficult cases of epilepsy. Then the FDA
went into a bizarre - and secretive - application process to approve the use of VNS for
treatment-resistant depression or TRD.


The FDA's head honcho then responsible for approvals, Dr. Daniel Shultz, made an
astonishing decision to override an entire FDA panel and sign the company's application -
personally.


He approved the application despite objections of more than 20 FDA scientists, doctors
and managers, according to a report filed in the Congressional Record. He acknowledged
to staffers that the public would be unaware of this.


Reports of death after death and injury after injury among VNS epileptic patients poured
in, TheStreetSweeper found, even as the company sought the depression-use application.


Death reports reached 115. Injury reports hit 181 and malfunction reports reached 458
during that time.


During that time, the FDA also socked the company with an official warning letter in
December 2004 that listed 30-odd serious allegations - including failure to fully investigate
adverse events - uncovered during the agency's two-month inspection of Cyberonics. The
company took months to address the issues to get the FDA to close the file just three
months before Dr. Schultz stunned the FDA team with his decision.


FDA reviewers: Like an "experimental project;" "disturbed"

The FDA panel reviewed Cyberonics' application materials for 15 long months. They
focused on Cyberonics' clinical studies on depression (TRD) and determined they did not
show the device was safe or effective.


One reviewer said in an email: "I am disturbed that VNS might actually get an approval for
''TRD''. In my opinion, they do not have adequate data and I don't understand how this can
move forward."


Another wrote: "As an MD interested in science, it seems to me that such an approval
would be akin to approving an experimental product."


Cyberonics increased its lobbying effort, in the midst of all this, to mount the company's
record high in 2005 of nearly half-a-million-dollars.


Meanwhile, the FDA rumblings reached the ears of Sen. Charles Grassley and Sen. Max
Baucus, who commanded an investigation into the FDA's decision.


Though the FDA team recommended again and again that the device not be approved for
treating depression, the Senate staff report states that "at every stage of the review, the
team was instructed by the FDA official, who ultimately made the decision to approve the
device, to proceed with the next stage of pre-market review."


Patients and doctors were kept in the dark about the scientific dissension or that
Cyberonics' short-term study "failed to reach, or even come close to reaching, statistical
significance with respect to its primary endpoint (of efficacy)."


The FDA team requested that the company strengthen its weak study results by
conducting a new randomized, controlled study prior to approval, according to the report.
Cyberonics refused to conduct that study pre-approval.


The investigative report and the senators harshly criticized the whole mess. On Aug. 10,
2005, Dr. Schultz resigned by "mutual consent" with the FDA commissioner. He later
found a job with a consulting firm serving companies regulated by the FDA.


But Cyberonics already had what it wanted. On July 15, 2005, the company walked away
with FDA's approval letter in its back pocket.


Another risk: Medicare/Medicaid approval fails - again


Insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield hit the warning bell shortly after the FDA approval
with an ominous comment that "overall, the evidence supporting efficacy of VNS is not
strong." Over the years, insurers tended to pay in some depression cases but generally

refused because of the safety and effectiveness questions.


Insurance often isn't covering VNS treatment now, according to Dr. Robert Dolgoff,
director of the Berkeley Therapy Institute in California.


Cyberonics chief executive Daniel Moore mentioned this very issue during the last
earnings call. Mr. Moore, who replaced the embattled CEO in charge during the
application fiasco, partially blamed weakness in the last month of the quarter on "an
unusually large number of changes in insurance coverage."


Cyberonics has tried numerous times to get the ever-important Medicare/Medicaid
reimbursement for VNS for depression.


But time and again, Medicare/Medicaid has said, "No," and it seems doubtful Cyberonics
will secure coverage for depression use, effectively shutting itself out of its most promising
market. After the May 2007 Medicare denial, Cyberonics filings say it ceased marketing
VNS for depression in all markets.


The stock price crumpled by 10 percent last May on the most recent news that federal
administrators once again said, "No," to Medicare reimbursement costs for depression.


The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) pays for about 25 percent of the
implants, the company's filings state. The cost for implant surgery and programming the
device runs about $25,000.


The company didn't respond to TheStreetSweeper's request for comment. Investors may
find other viewpoints on Cyberonics HERE.


Risk: Options, options and more options for difficult epilepsy and depression cases


"Write this down, 'TMS,'" said Dr. Dolgoff.


TMS or transcranial magnetic stimulation is probably the hottest, new FDA-approved
treatment for depression. Dr. Oz featured this nerve-stimulating therapy on his show,
showing a doctor using a painless magnet inside a helmet-like device on an audience
member. The magnet - pinging like a subdued woodpecker - stimulates the part of the
brain responsible for depression. Therapy takes about 35 minutes, five days a week for
three to six weeks until depression disappears.


Results have been so encouraging that Dr. Dolgoff said his clinic now recommends TMS
first for patients with depression.

This private company's non-invasive therapy - a far cry from Cyberonics' surgical implant -
is among the potential risks listed in the company's Securities and Exchange Commission
filings.


Cyberonics also faces stiff competition from $58-billion Medtronic (NYSE:MDT), the giant
that parlayed its Deep Brain Stimulation therapy beyond the Parkinson's field into the
refractory epilepsy field with FDA approval.


Mountain View, Calif.-area private company NeuroPace's therapy just last November got
FDA approval for difficult-to-treat epilepsy and is in early commercialization. This
newcomer's RNS device sends an electric pulse through thin wires precisely located at the
one or two spots in the brain where seizures start.


"We don't look at VNS from a competitive perspective. We really look at the need to grow
the overall field," said NeuroPace chief executive Frank Fischer.


A NeuroPace study found seizures dropped 37.9 percent in patients implanted with live
RNS wires. For comparison, a Cyberonics' study found seizures dropped just 28 percent
with the highest level of VNS. The low stimulation VNS group saw 15 percent - or 2
percent less relief - than RNS subjects who received absolutely no stimulation from their
RNS wires.


"Both of us, ourselves and Cyberonics, are going to benefit by virtue of the therapy
becoming available. Because it gives the community something to think about, to discuss,
to get excited about and then doctors refer their patients. That's what's not been going on
in recent years," said Mr. Fischer.


Since the therapy addresses difficult or refractory epilepsy, this poses some issues.
Cyberonics claims about 70,000 patients in this comparatively small category of about
400,000 that seems unlikely to suddenly grow. In fact, only six more US units were sold
last quarter than the same quarter the year before.


So replacement units would be especially important to sales growth. Unfortunately,
Cyberonics is seeing a decline in replacement devices. They fell by 9 percent last quarter
compared with prior year, or 1,047.


Cyberonics' SEC filings also include Neurotech, CerebralRX and St. Jude Medical among
the arm's-length list of companies aiming for depression and epilepsy patients.
