V. IDENTIFICATION OF CHALLENGE
A. Overview of US. Patent No. 6,315,720 The ’720 Patent is titled “Methods for Delivering a Drug To
A Patient W’hile Avoiding The Occurrence Of An Adverse Side Effect Known Or Suspected Of Being
Patent No. 6,315,720 Caused By The Drug.” (EX. 1001 at Front Cover.) The underlying application,
US.
Patent Application Serial No. 09/694,217, was filed on October 23, 2000. The ’720 Patent issued to
Bruce \‘Villiams and]oseph K. Kaminski on November 13, 2001. (Id)
1. The ’720 Patent Specification The ’720 Patent claims methods for delivering a drug to a patient,
while avoiding the occurrence of adverse side effects. (EX. 1001 at Abstract.) The ’720 Patent
generally describes methods for “the distribution to patients of drugs, particularly teratogenic drugs,
in ways wherein such distribution can be carefully monitored and controlled.” (Id at 1:13—16.) A
teratogenic drug can cause severe birth defects when administered to a pregnant woman. (Id at
1:27—29.) The ’720 speci�cation acknowledges that prior “[m]ethods for monitoring and educating
patients to whom a drug is distributed have been developed in connection with” a known
teratogenic drug (isotretinoin), including a “pregnancy prevention program.”
(Id at 2:13—20.)
The invention of the ’720 Patent was allegedly conceived in the context of the FDA approval of
thalidomide—a teratogenic drug effective in treating a variety of diseases—when the inventors were
seeking methods “to control the distribution of [thalidomide] so as to preclude administration to
fetuses.” (Id at 1:46—64.)
The ’720 Patent’s invention can be summarized as: (1) �lling prescriptions only after consulting a
computer readable storage medium to con�rm that the prescribers, pharmacies, and patients are
registered in a computer database; (2) assigning patients
Patent No. 6,315,720 to risk groups based on the risk that the drug will cause adverse side effects
and entering the risk group assignment in the storage medium; (3) determining the acceptability of
the likely adverse effect; and (4) “generating a prescription approval code to said pharmacy before
said prescription is �lled.” (Id at 2:49—3:4.) The ’720 Patent speci�cation also teaches that “[t]he
invention is not limited to the distribution of teratogenic drugs; other potentially hazardous drugs
may also be distributed in accordance with embodiments of this invention in such a fashion that
persons for whom such drugs are contraindicated will not receive them.” (Id at 3:21—26.)
The patent also discloses that when a patient is registered in the computer readable storage
medium, information probative of the risk of a drug’s side effects is also collected from the patient.
(Id at 6:30—33.) This information can then be compared with a de�ned set of risk parameters for the
drug, allowing for assignment of the patient to a particular risk group. (Id at 6:33—36.) If the risk of
adverse side effects is deemed acceptable, the patient may receive the drug from a registered
pharmacy, subject to conditions such as a negative pregnancy test, but may not receive re�lls
without a renewal prescription from the prescriber. (Id at 11:62—12:8 )


2. The ’720 Claims The ’720 Patent has two independent claims and 30 dependent claims. Claim 1
is representative and is reproduced below.

s ep ese tat e a d s ep oduced be o
In a method for delivering a drug to a patient in need of the drug, while avoiding the occurrence of
an adverse side effect known or suspected of Patent No. 6,315,720 being caused by said drug,
wherein said method is of the type in which prescriptions for said drug are filled only after a
computer readable storage medium has been consulted to assure that the prescriber is registered in
said medium and qualified to prescribe said drug, that the pharmacy is registered in said medium
and qualified to fill the prescription for said drug, and the patient is registered in said medium and
approved to receive said drug, the improvement comprising: a. defining a plurality of patient risk
groups based upon a predefined set of risk parameters for said drug; b. defining a set of information
to be obtained from said patient, which information is probative of the risk that said adverse side
effect is likely to occur if said drug is taken by said patient; c. in response to said information set,
assigning said patient to at least one of said risk groups and entering said risk group assignment in
said medium;
d. based upon said information and said risk group assignment, determining whether the risk that
said adverse side effect is likely to occur is acceptable; and e. upon a determination that said risk is
acceptable, generating a prescription approval code to be retrieved by said pharmacy before said
prescription is filled.
(Id. at 18:17—42.) All other claim limitations are listed within Ground 1 below.
3. The ’720 Prosecution History During prosecution of US. Patent Application No. 09/694,217 (filed
October 23, 2000), which led to the ’720 Patent, the Examiner initially rejected Claims 1—27 as
obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over US. Patent No. 6,045,501 (EX. 1003, “Eliza/ed”)
Patent No. 6,315,720 in view of US. Patent No. 6,063,026 (Ex. 1004, “Sc/Jam?) (See Ex. 1002 at 57—
581) At this time, Claims 1—32 were pending. (Id at 56.) Claim 1, the only independent claim, recited
“a method for delivering a drug to a patient in need of the drug while avoiding the occurrence of an
adverse side effect known or suspected of being caused by said drug.” (Id at 44.)
The Examiner rejected Claims 1—27, stating that EZMQ/éd suggested the “use of the information to
evaluate risk levels,” while 50/151743; taught “a medical diagnostic analysis system that evaluates
patient data obtained from medical testing or patient questioning for drugs contraindications.” (Id at
58.) The Examiner concluded that “it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at
the time of the invention to implement the screening for drug contraindications suggested in Elsayed
et al. with the method of Schauss et al., since Schauss et al. teach the particular steps for performing
the analysis.” (Id at 58.) Regarding Claim 6, the Examiner stated that although EZJ‘LQ/éd “does not
speci�cally teach that data received by facsimile transmission is entered by an OCR software, it is
inherent that this data must be entered into database.” (Id at 58.) The Examiner also objected to
Claims 28—32 “as being dependent upon a rejected base claim, but would be allowable if rewritten
in independent form.” (Id at 59.)
1 Except for the prosecution history, exhibit cites herein are directed to the internal page numbers of
the exhibit, rather than to the Exhibit’s Bates numbers.


Patent No. 6,315,720 In response, applicants amended Claim 1 by adding, among other limitations,
“upon a determination that said risk is acceptable, generating a prescription approval code to be

upo  a dete at o  t at sa d s  s acceptab e, ge e at g a p esc pt o  app o a  code to be
retrieved by said pharmacy before said prescription is �lled.” (Id at 87.)
Based on this amendment, applicants argued that “Eliza/ed, although teaching a method which
contains many of the steps of the present invention, contains no disclosure of the generation of a
prescription approval code as recited in amended Claim 1.” (Id at 85.) Applicants further argued that
“[a]lthough Schauss may describe a medical diagnostic analysis system that evaluates patient data
obtained from questioning a patient or medical testing, Schauss contains no disclosure remotely
related to the generation of a prescription approval code, this being the subject of Applicants’
claims.” (Id at 86.)
In response, the Examiner rejected the claims as obvious over EZMQ/éd in view of 50/151743; and
Bg/er, US. Patent No. 6,202,923 (EX. 1005, “BOJWP ), which “includes a step for generating a
prescription number or code associated with said prescription by a computer workstation.” (Id at 91
—92.)
In response, applicants argued: As amended on March 23, 2001, Claim 1 further requires an
assessment, based upon the risk group assignment and the information collected from the patient,
as to whether the risk of the side effect occurring is acceptable. Upon a determination that the risk is
acceptable, and 0/141 74 0/1 3740/} d determination, a prescription approval code is generated,
which must be retrieved by the pharmacy before the prescription may be �lled. Thus, Patent No.
6,315,720 the prescription approval code is not merely a number that is associated with the
prescription, but instead represents the fact that a determination has been made that the risk of the
side effect occurring is acceptable, and that approval—an af�rmative decision—has been made for
the prescription to be �lled. Boyer does not disclose or suggest such an
approval code.
(Id at 106—07.) Applicants further argued that in Boyer, the prescription number “is simply an
identi�er for the prescription, and is not an approoa/ code, as recited in Applicants’ claims,” and that
Boyer provides “no indication that a peexmpfz'oa approoa/ code, as described and claimed in the
instant application, must be generated and retrieved by the pharmacist before the prescription may
be �lled.” (Id at 107.)
The applicants amended Claim 28 to be an independent claim, and then argued that because “[a]ny
proper combination of the disclosure of Boyer with that of Elsayed and Schauss does not teach or
suggest the invention de�ned by Applicants’ claims,” the Examiner should withdraw the 103
rejection. (Id at 106—07.)
After this response, all of the ’720 Patent claims were allowed. (Id at 111.)
B. Claim Construction of Challenged Claims A claim subject to IPR receives the “broadest reasonable
construction in light of the speci�cation of the patent in which it appears.” 37 C.F.R. § 42.100(b); xee
In re Caozzo Speed Tee/13., LLC, 778 F.3d 1271, 1279 (Fed. Cir. 2015). In applying such a standard,
the broadest reasonable construction of claim language is not one that permits any reading, but

Ted}. Cm, 367 F.3d 1359, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2004) (citation omitted).
Unless otherwise noted, Petitioner accepts, for purposes of IPR only, that the claim terms of the ’720
Patent are presumed to take on the ordinary and customary meaning that they would have to one of
ordinary skill in the art.2
1. “Consulted” “Consulted” means “accessed and considered.” (EX. 1030 at 3; EX. 1027 1] 39.)
2. “Teratogenic effect” “Teratogenic effect” means “any effect that disturbs the normal growth and
development of an embryo or fetus.” (EX. 1030 at 2; EX. 1027 1] 40.)
2 Petitioner notes that, in some instances, the patentee has de�ned claim terms apart from their
plain meaning. See Pacing 7766/13., LLC v. Cami/1 Im’l, Imz, 778 F.3d 1021, 1024 (Fed. Cir. 2015).
These terms include “drug,” “computer readable storage

C. Statement of Precise Relief Requested for Each Claim Challenged 1. Claims for Which Review is
Requested Petitioners request IPR under 35 U.S.C. § 311 of Claims 1—32 of the ’720
Patent, and cancellation of these 32 claims as unpatentable.
2. Statutory Grounds of Challenge
Petitioners request IPR of Claims 1—32 of the ’720 Patent in view of the following references, each
of which is prior art to the ’720 Patent under 35 U.S.C.
§§ 102(a) and (b) or 103. The Examiner did not reference any of the prior art listed in the following
chart in any Office Action. (See genera/Z , EX. 1002.) Claims 1—32 are unpatentable under 35 U.S.C.
§ 103:
Ground Proposed Rejections for the ’720 Patent Exhibit Number(s) 1 Claims 1—32 are obvious
under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) in 1007, 1008, and
view of Mme/1 (EX 1010), Dix/177m” (EX. 1007), and
Cunning/Jaw (EX 1008).
D. Overview of the State of the Art and Motivation t0 Combine By October of 2000, it was well
recognized in the art that teratogenic drugs— which can cause birth defects—needed to be
regulated. (See, e.g., EX. 1006 at 901—04;
Patent No. 6,315,720 EX. 1010 at 101—05.) The central regulatory goal was to avoid pregnancy in
patients treated with the drug. (See, e.g., EX. 1010 at 101.) One notable case of a drug marketed
through methods to prevent its use in pregnant patients is isotretinoin, marketed under the trade
name Accutane®. (See EX. 1010 at 101.) Rather than remove this drug


from the market once its teratogenicity was realized, isotretinoin became part of a manufacturer—
sponsored Pregnancy Prevention Program (“PPP”). (EX. 1010 at 101.)
5/23/2018 libpatent

spo so ed eg a cy e e t o  og a  ( )  (  0 0 at 0 )
The program, among other features, included the distribution to physicians of a kit that included
informed consent documents and patient counseling information.
(EX. 1010 at 101.) In particular, patients were warned against the teratogenic risk of isotretinoin and
the need to prevent pregnancy. (EX. 1010 at 105.) Patients were also advised as to effective
available methods of birth control. (See EX. 1010 at 103.)
Thalidomide is a drug that originated in Germany in 1957. (EX. 1001 at 1:40— 41.) Doctors initially
prescribed the drug as a sedative, but quickly noticed its effectiveness in treating a form of leprosy,
erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), as well. (EX. 1011 at 320—21.) However, shortly after
thalidomide came on the market, doctors realized that the drug caused severe birth defects in
infants whose mothers took the drug while pregnant. (EX. 1011 at 320.) As a result, thalidomide
was generally taken off of most markets by 1962. (EX. 1001 at 1:44—45.) Due to thalidomide’s
therapeutic effects, the drug was reintroduced in the United States in the 1990s with the
understanding it could be marketed only with strict controls, and gained FDA approval to treat ENL
in 1998. (See EX. 1006 at 901; EX. 1011 at 320.)
Patent No. 6,315,720 Doctors and pharmacists interested in bringing thalidomide to the market with
restrictions to protect from its teratogenic effects considered the Accutane PPP, with its focus on
counseling, as a starting point. (EX. 1012 at 110—11; reg EX. 1014 at 1.)
They also considered modeling a thalidomide program on experiences with other hazardous drugs,
including clozapine (trade name Clozaril®). (EX. 1012 at 111—12.)
As early as 1997, medical professionals observed that the prescription control methods for
clozapine, an anti—depressant with potential adverse effects indicated by white blood cell counts
(“\VBCs”), could be copied for thalidomide. (EX. 1012 at 112.) In particular, these prescription control
methods included keeping records of patients taking the drug, as well as physicians and
pharmacists pre—approved to prescribe and dispense the drug. (EX. 1007 at 899—900; 366 EX.
1012 at 115—19; EX. 1014 at 9, 24.) The clozapine patients were additionally required to submit to
weekly \VBC testing and could only have a prescription for clozapine �lled if the test results fell
within a pre—designated range. (EX. 1007 at 899; 366 EX. 1012 at 112; EX. 1014 at 8.)
It was also “well known in the art prior to 2000 that prescription records can be kept in a
computerized system.” (See, e.g., EX. 1015 at 174; EX. 1016 at 56, 60—63, 68; EX. 1027 1] 56.) Such
records would include information about the patient such as their seX, height, weight, allergies, and
other health—related measures. (See EX. 1016 at 59; EX. 1027 1] 56.) Physicians and pharmacists
had used computerized systems to track their patients since at least 1975. (See, e.g., EX. 1016 at 53;
EX. 1015 at 174, 182—
Patent No. 6,315,720 83.) Practitioners then used this data to determine (1) whether to prescribe a
drug to a particular patient, and (2) how long a patient should take the medication. (See EX. 1016
Thus, in the case of thalidomide or any teratogenic drug, those of ordinary skill in the art would have
been—and indeed were—“motivated to combine the method for avoiding pregnancy with a
computerized tracking system that only permits filling prescriptions for the drug when certain


conditions (ag, non—pregnancy) are met.” (See EX. 1033 at 1136 (“Celgene has drafted a plan that
it hopes will prevent fetal eXposure to the drug. The plan is built on experience with restrictions on

1. Summary of the Petition’s Prior Art References a. M'tchell (Ex. 1010) Mifc‘ljell constitutes prior art
under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because it was published in 1995. (EX 1010 at Cover.) During prosecution
of the ’720 Patent, the examiner did not consider this reference. (See EX. 1001 at Cover.)
Mifc‘ljell discloses a pregnancy prevention program implemented to minimize pregnancies among
women treated with the known teratogenic drug isotretinoin. (See EX. 1010 at 101—05.) The
program sought “to keep the drug available while minimizing the teratogenic hazard.” (Id. at 105.)
Additionally, the program—targeted
Patent No. 6,315,720 at both prescribers and patients—instructed prescribers to “warn patients of
risks, obtain negative pregnancy tests, and delay therapy until the second or third day of the neXt
normal menstrual period.” (Id at 101.) The program also provided materials to patients such as
information brochures and contraceptive information. (Id at 101.)
Mme/1 also describes counseling patients in relation to isotretinoin’s teratogenic effects. (Id at 105.)
Some implementations of the program included warnings about the “need to have a negative blood
pregnancy test before starting therapy. . .and to use effective birth control one month before starting
therapy, during therapy, and one month after completing it.” (Id at 103.)
b. Dishman (Ex. 1007) Dix/17mm constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b) because it was
published in 1989. (EX. 1007 at 899.) During the prosecution of the ’720 Patent, the examiner did not
consider this reference. (See EX. 1001 at Cover.)
Dix/17mm discloses a program for controlling the dispensing of clozapine, an antipsychotic drug, to
veterans. (EX. 1007 at 899.) Clozapine is associated with the “life—threatening side effect of
agranulocytosis.” (EX. 1012 at 112.) Dix/17mm describes a monitoring program instituted by the
Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) in 1991 to prevent contraindicated individuals from receiving
clozapine. (EX. 1007 at 900.)
Speci�cally, Dix/17mm teaches that the VA’s program established a National Clozapine
Coordinating Center (“NCCC”) to “review each clozapine candidate’s �le before granting approval for
use and weekly tracking. . ..” (Id at 900.) Prior to this
Patent No. 6,315,720 approval, each patient underwent extensive evaluation and documentation to
identify contraindications, including pregnancy. (Id at 900.) Additionally, for prescription or use of
clozapine, prescribers and patients had to register with the Clozaril National Registry, which requires
weekly monitoring of a patient’s white blood cell counts and limits the quantity of medicine
dispensed at one time. (Id at 899.) This process “requires the cooperation and coordinated efforts of
the patient, physician, laboratory, and pharmacy.” (Id at 899.) The NCCC also mandated that each
hospital have a computerized clozapine prescription lockout system, which tied the hospital’s
laboratory database to the outpatient pharmacy dispensing software. (Id at 900.) Thus, clozapine


prescriptions could only be processed when certain pre—de�ned clinical criteria were met—
speci�cally, when white blood cell counts were within de�ned limits. (Id at 899.)

spec ca y, e  te b ood ce  cou ts e e t  de ed ts  ( d at 899 )
c. Cunningham (Ex. 1008) The Cunning/Jaw patent constitutes prior art under 35 U.S.C. § 102(b)
because it was �led in 1995 and granted in 1998. (Ex. 1008 at Cover.) During the prosecution of the
’720 Patent, the examiner did not consider this reference. (See Ex. 1001 at Cover.)
The examiner did consider, but did not cite, a divisional of this reference. (See Ex. 1001 at Cover; Ex.
1010 at Cover.)
Cunning/Jaw discloses a method of dispensing pharmaceutical product samples by linking
prescribers and pharmacies to a central computing station. (Ex. 1008 at Cover.) Speci�cally, before
�lling any prescription for a pharmaceutical trial product, Patent No. 6,315,720 the pharmacy must
upload defined information into the central computing station.
(See id. at 11:6—13.) Only if the central computing station establishes that the uploaded information
is valid can the central computing station issue a pharmacy approval code for the pharmacy to then
dispense the pharmaceutical product. (See id. at 11:13—23.)
E. Level of Ordinary Skill in the Art
A persona of ordinary skill in the art (“POSA”) in pharmaceutical prescriptions
as of October 23, ZOOO—the earliest possible priority date for the ’720 Patent— “would typically
have either a Pharm. D. or a BS in pharmacy with approximately 5— 10 years of eXperience and a
license to practice as a registered pharmacist in any one or more of the United States.” (EX. 1027 1]
16.) An ordinarily skilled artisan “may work as part of a multi—disciplinary team and draw upon not
only his or her own skills, but also take advantage of certain specialized skills of others on the team,
to solve a given problem and care for varying patient populations.” (EX. 1027 1] 17.)
VI. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE CHALLENGE
A. Ground 1: Claims 1—32 of US. Patent No. 6,315,720 are obvious under 35 U.S.C. § 103(a) over
M’tclzell in View of Disbman and in further
View of Cunningham and the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the 1. Claim 1 is obvious over
[Mitchell in View of Disbman and in further View of Cunningham.
Claim 1 of the ’720 Patent “is written in Jepson format, meaning that the claim �rst describes the
scope of the prior art and then claims an improvement over the
Patent No. 6,315,720
prior art.” D0777 C0007. C0. 0. 5777777707770 C0007. C0, 257 F.3d 1364, 1368 (Fed. Cir. 2001).
Specifically, the Claim 1 preamble recites: In a method for delivering a drug to a patient in need of
the drug, while avoiding the occurrence of an adverse side effect known or suspected of being
caused by said drug, wherein said method is of the type in which prescriptions for said drug are
filled only after a computer readable storage medium has been consulted to assure that the
prescriber is registered in said medium and qualified to prescribe said drug, that the pharmacy is
registered in said medium and qualified to fill the prescription for said drug, and the patient is
registered in said medium and approved to receive said drug, the improvement comprising: (EX.
1001 at 18:17—27 (emphasis added).) Because “a preamble is impliedly admitted to be prior art


when aJepson claim is used,” the patentee has admitted that the Claim 1 preamble is prior art,
rather than a point of novelty. P077700, [770. 0. Crap/770 Comm/5

1026, 1028 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (rejecting a claim “as obvious in view of the admitted prior art from the
claim preamble and a single cited reference”).
An ordinarily skilled artisan, “when seeking to treat patients with a drug ‘known or suspected of
causing an adverse side effect as in Claim 1’s preamble, would look to Mifc‘ljell for guidance on an
‘approach that seeks to keep the drug available while minimizing the hazard,’ and would garner
from its recommendations for ‘delivering a drug to a patient in need of the drug, while avoiding the
occurrence of an adverse side effect known or suspected of being caused by said drug,’” as the
Patent No. 6,315,720 preamble requires. (EX. 1010 at 105; EX. 1027 1] 76.) See In 7? Icon Had/�}
e’fisz'f/rexx, Imz, 496 F.3d 1374, 1380 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (“One skilled in the art would naturally look to
prior art addressing the same problem as the invention at hand, and in this case would �nd an
appropriate solution”).
\With respect to Claim 1 of the ’720 Patent, an ordinarily skilled artisan would understand from
Mitchell the desirability, when treating patients with drugs associated with adverse side effects to
certain risk groups, of “de�ning a plurality of patient risk groups based upon a predefined set of risk
parameters for said drug” as required by Claim 1(a), “de�ning a set of information to be obtained
from said patient, which information is probative of the risk that said adverse side effect is likely to
occur if said drug is taken by said patient” as required by Claim 1(b), “in response to said information
set, assigning said patient to at least one of said risk groups” as required by the �rst portion of Claim
1(c), and “based upon said information and said risk group assignment, determining whether the
risk that said adverse side effect is likely to occur is acceptable” as required by Claim 1(d). (See EX.
1010 at 101—02, 105; EX. Speci�cally, Mifc‘ljell teaches a “patient—quali�cation checklist” for
assigning patients to the risk groups to which a drug with teratogenic side effects, such as
isotretinoin, can and cannot be administered, as in Claim 1(a), based on the unacceptable risk of
teratogenic side effects to a fetus, as in Claim 1(d). (EX. 1010 at 101; EX. 1027 1111 79, 94.)
Mz'fc‘ljell’ s risk group list includes, for example, “women of
Patent No. 6,315,720 childbearing age” and “women who were at high risk of becoming pregnant,”
with patients outside of these groups falling into a separate, lower risk category. (EX. 1010 at 102,
105.) One of ordinary skill in the art would understand that a prescriber would assign a patient to
these various risk groups, as in the �rst portion of Claim 1(c), by obtaining information from the
patient such as their gender, and whether they are of “childbearing age” or at a “high risk of
becoming pregnant,” which are “probative of the risk that said adverse side effect is likely to occur if
said drug is taken by said patient,” as in Claim 1(b). (EX. 1010 at 102, 105; EX. 1027 1] 81.)
\‘Vith respect to the second portion of Claim 1(c)—“entering said risk group in said medium”—an
ordinarily skilled artisan would understand from Mitchell that written records should be kept relating
to risk group and related information.
(EX. 1027 1] 84.) For example, Mitchell recorded certain information via “survey— enrollment
consent forms.” (EX. 1010 at 102.) Although Mme/1 does not eXplicitly mention keeping these


records in a “computer readable storage medium,” because Mme/1 published the aggregated patient
risk group information collected, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that

Mitchell inherently “entered the risk group information in a computer readable storage medium.” (EX.
1027 1] 86.)
See PdVP/Jdm., Im‘. a. TW? 1365177775., Imz, 773 F.3d 1186, 1194—1195 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“W e
have recognized that inherency may supply a missing claim limitation in an obviousness analysis.”).
Additionally, it would have been obvious to an ordinarily skilled artisan “that electronic records of
information such as the patient risk group
Patent No. 6,315,720 assignment would be useful and easy to achieve through the entry into a
computer.”
(EX. 1027 1] 85.) See Pfizer, Inc. a Apofex, Imz, 480 F.3d 1348, 1364 (Fed. Cir. 2007) (finding
obviousness where “the skilled artisan would have had that reasonable expectation of success that
[application of the prior art technique] would work for its intended purpose”).
Like Min/yell, which teaches guidelines for tightly—controlling the dispensing of isotretinoin,
Dix/977m” discloses a program for tightly controlling the dispensing of the antipsychotic drug
clozapine. (See EX. 1007 at 899—901.) Armed with the disclosure of Mite/yell, an ordinarily skilled
artisan “would have been motivated to look to the system disclosed in Dix/977m” to further
implement a computerized registry for ‘delivering a drug to a patient in need of the drug, while
avoiding the occurrence of an adverse side effect known or suspected of being caused by said
drug.’” (EX.1001 at 18:16—18; EX. 1027 1] 88.) See Tyc‘o Hedi/9mm G731). LP 0. Elf/aim” Elicia—
Surya, Imz, 774 F.3d 968, 977 (Fed. Cir. 2014) (“\Vhen a claimed invention involves a combination of
elements, however, any need or problem known in the relevant �eld of endeavor at the time of
invention can provide a reason to combine”). Indeed, those of ordinary skill in the art did look to the
same isotretinoin system described in Mite/yell with respect to the ’720 Patent. (EX. 1001 at 2:13—
35; EX. 1033 at 1036.) See Rogm v. Dem Imf’l, Imz, 198 Fed.
Appx. 918, 922 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (“Evidence that those of ordinary skill in the art in fact combined the
prior art teachings as claimed is certainly evidence that they were Patent No. 6,315,720 motivated
to do so. Such evidence shows the knowledge of the skilled artisan at the time of the invention,
which can provide the basis for a motivation to combine”).
\Vith respect to the second portion of Claim 1(c)—“entering said risk group in said medium”—
Dz'x/de/¢ discloses the storage of the patient’s “clinical and demographic information” on a
computer readable storage medium. (EX. 1007 at 899.) For example, Dix/mm” teaches that the
“NCCC requires that each hospital have a computerized clozapine prescription lockout system. . .
[that] ties the hospital’s laboratory database to the outpatient pharmacy dispensing software.” (EX.
1007 at 900.) An ordinarily skilled artisan “would have understood from the Dix/mm” reference that
this computerized system must include the patient’s risk group assignment data in order to
determine which prescriptions should be ‘locked out. ’”
(EX. 1027 1] 91.) See PdVP/Jdm., Imz, 773 F.3d at 1194—1195.
The �nal portion of the ’720 Patent’s Claim 1—Claim 1(e)—requires that, “upon a determination that
said risk is acceptable, generating a prescription approval code to be retrieved by said pharmacy


before said prescription is �lled.” (EX. 1001 at 18:40—42.) This mechanism would have been obvious
to an ordinarily skilled artisan upon reading Dix/mm”, which discloses approval of acceptable risk

through a “registry [that] permits community and hospital pharmacies to dispense clozapine only
upon the pharmacist’s veri�cation that the \VBC count is within acceptable limits. . .. [T]he lockout
system prevents the �lling of any clozapine prescription if the computer
Patent No. 6,315,720
notices three consecutive drops in \VBC count.” (EX. 1007 at 899—900; EX. 1027 Additionally, as the
’720 Patent correctly states, “[s]uitable computer readable storage media will be apparent to one of
ordinary skill in the art, once armed with the teachings of the present application”) (EX. 1001 at 5:11
—16.) An approval code system such as that required by Claim 1(e)—already known to those of
ordinary skill in the art at the time—would be an obvious mechanism for one of ordinary skill in the
art to use in order to implement Dix/Jfimn’s lockout system. (EX. 1027 1] 97.) See
Bog/er Sc/Jerz'ng 13/}de AG 0. BdWLdlix., Imu, 575 F.3d 1341, 1347 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“CW hen there
is a design need or market pressure to solve a problem and there are a finite number of identified,
predictable solutions, a person of ordinary skill has good reason to pursue the known options within
his or her technical grasp. If this leads to the anticipated success, it is likely the product not of
innovation but of ordinary skill and common sense.’”) (quoting KSR Inf! C0. 0. Te/ef/ex Imz, 550 U.S.
398, 421 (2007).
It would have been further obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to utilize the Claim 1(e) approval
codes to implement Dix/me’s lockout system, in light of Cunning/Jam’s disclosure of an approval code
lockout system for a pharmacy: If authenticity is not established, it follows that the participating
pharmacy cannot dispense corresponding pharmaceutical product.
However, if authenticity is established then the pharmac[y’s] terminal dials the central computing
station and data and information from the pharmac[y’s] authorization media and personal
identification is uploaded Patent No. 6,315,720 to the database of the central computing station 12.
Assuming full validation, the central c0mputings_tation issues a pharmm approval code and the
pharmacy records that approval code on the
actual presented product trial media 18. Once validation is established the wrmacy then dispenses
pharmaceutical trial product (EX. 1008 at 11:6—8, 17—23 (emphasis added); EX. 1027 1] 98.) See
KSR Ibf'l Ca, 550 US. at 416—17 (holding that where a straightforward combination of references
“[s]imply arranges old elements with each performing the same function it had been known to
perform and yields no more than one would expect from such an arrangement, the combination is
obvious”) (internal quotations and citations omitted).
“In view of the guidelines for the avoidance of treating pregnant patients with isotretinoin taught by
Mamba/Z, it would have been obvious” to an ordinarily skilled artisan “to implement the methods
disclosed in Dz'xbbmb and Cbbbibgbdbz to limit dispensation of a drug associated with adverse
effects to certain risk groups.”
(EX. 1027 1] 99.) See Abbott Lab; 0. Abdrx Pde§., Imz, 452 F.3d 1331, 1345 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (finding
substantial question of invalidity because the combination of references for “the reduction of
systemic side effects would not be surprising and would not be unexpected”). Therefore, an


ordinarily skilled artisan “treating a patient with a teratogenic or other risk—laden drug in
accordance with the guidelines disclosed in Mz'fc‘be/Z would look to published methods for limiting

code system
Patent No. 6,315,720 taught by Cunningham—and would view Claim 1 of the ‘720 Patent obvious in
view of these three references.” (EX. 1027 1] 100.) See 1)};de Texfz'fldrbm waH 0. CH. Patric/é Ca,
464 F.3d 1356, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (“The motivation need not be found in the references sought to
be combined, but may be found in any number of sources, including common knowledge, the prior
art as a whole, or the nature of the problem itself”).
2. Dependent Claims 2—6 are obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and more speci�cally over
[Mitchell in view of Disbman and in further view of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.
Claims 2—6 depend from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the �eld and
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claim 2 requires that “in response to said risk group
assignment, said patient is counseled as to the risks of taking said drug and advised as to risk
avoidance measures,” while Claim 3 requires that the Claim 2 “counseling comprises full disclosure
of said risks,” Claim 4 requires that “said prescription is �lled only following [the Claim 3] full
disclosure and informed consent of said patient,” Claim 5 requires that “said risk group assignment
and [Claim 4] informed consent is veri�ed by said prescriber at the time that said patient is
registered in said computer readable storage medium,” and Claim 6 requires that “said risk group
assignment and said informed consent is transmitted to |the Claim 5| computer readable storage
medium by facsimile and interpreted by optical character recognition software.” (EX. 1001 at 18:43
—58 (emphasis added).)
Patent No. 6,315,720 Mme/1 teaches that the disclosed “program encourages communication
between physicians and patients regarding the drug’s teratogenic risk and the need to prevent
pregnancy,” and that physicians were further provided with guidelines: instructing them, for
example, to warn patients of risks, obtain negative pregnancy tests, and delay therapy until the
second or third day of the next normal menstrual period. They also included a patient—quali�cation
checklist, an information brochure for patients, contraceptive information, information about and the
necessary forms for a contraception referral program (in which the manufacturer would reimburse
patients for a visit to another physician for contraceptive counseling, and a consent form.
(EX. 1010 at 101 (emphasis added), 105.) Mme/1 additionally discloses that: the manufacturer
replaced traditional medication bottles with a 10— capsule blister pack that contained information
directed speci�cally at women: the package included warnings about the risks of becoming
pregnant while taking isotretinoin or during the month after treatment, an “avoid pregnancy” icon
behind each capsule, and line drawings of malformations associated with isotretinoin.
(EX. 1010 at 101.) This information meets the counseling and disclosure requirements of Claims 2
and 3. (EX. 1027 1] 104.)
In addition to the consent form contained in the physician information discussed above, Mme/1
further teaches “of the need for patient consent” and that “the program also included survey—
enrollment consent forms.” (EX.1010 at 102, 105.)


Patent No. 6,315,720 These teachings meet the disclosure and informed consent treatment
prerequisites of Claim 4.
5/23/2018 libpatent

p e equ s tes o  C a  
Additionally, because Mme/1 teaches that “[t]he enrollment forms were screened on receipt to
exclude enrollments that were apparently fraudulent, men, and previously enrolled women,” and
then “[t]he eligible women were assigned, at random, to be followed by one of the two methods,” it
“would have been obvious” to one of ordinary skill in the art “that the prescribing doctor would have
verified the disclosed requirements for treatment—such as the patient’s informed consent and risk
group assignment—when screening the enrollment forms and registering the patient in the
database” for following. (EX. 1010 at 102; EX. 1027 1N 107—08.) Dix/mm” further renders this Claim
5 veri�cation obvious, teaching that: the pharmacist screens potential candidates before they
undergo extensive evaluation. The screening involves reviewing the patient’s case with the
requesting practitioner, reviewing the patient’s �le, and interviewing the patient to ensure that the
patient and family members are committed to weekly blood tests and follow—up. This screening
ensures that the physician does not waste time evaluating patients who are ineligible for clozapine
therapy. After a patient has been determined eligible for clozapine therapy, the pharmacist forwards
all pertinent information to the NCCC. After NCCC approval, the pharmacist enrolls the patient into
the hospital’s clozapine tracking system, and clozapine therapy is begun.
(EX. 1007 at 900 (emphasis added); EX. 1027 1N 109—10.)
Patent No. 6,315,720 The previous disclosure also renders obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art
that the informed consent, risk group assignment, and other portions of the patient’s �le in the
Dix/17mm system are transmitted to the NCCC’s database described above with respect to Claim
1(c), and as required by the �rst portion of Claim 6. (EX. 1027 1] 112.) Dix/mm” further teaches that,
“[a]fter each weekly follow—up appointment, the pharmacist faXes a tracking sheet containing an
evaluation of the patient to the NCCC.” (EX. 1007 at 901.) Because it was within the knowledge of
one of ordinary skill in the art to transfer paper data into a computer database by faX, which is then
“interpreted by optical character recognition [OCR] software,” “it would have been obvious” to one of
ordinary skill in the art “that the Dix/mm” system would have used OCR software to load the
tracking sheet information into the NCCC database” (EX. 1027 1] 114.) Consequently, “[i]t also
would have been obvious” to an ordinarily skilled artisan “that paper risk group assignments and
informed consents could similarly be transferred to the database through faX and OCR,” as the last
portion of
Claim 6 requires. (EX. 1027 1] 114.) See Peifec‘f W617 “fey/13., 1m: 0. InfoUS/l, Imz, 587 F.3d 1324,
1329 (Fed. Cir. 2009) (“K5 R eXpanded the sources of information for a properly �eXible obviousness
inquiry to include the background knowledge, creativity, and common sense of the person of
ordinary skill”).
Patent No. 6,315,720 3. Dependent Claims 7—10 are obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and
more speci�cally over [Mitchell in view of Dishman and in further view of the knowledge of one of
ordinary skill in the art.
Claims 7—10 depend from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the �eld and
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claim 7 requires that the “information to be obtained from


said patient” prior to treatment “includes the results of diagnostic testing,” while Claims 8, 9, and 10
respectively require that the diagnostic testing “is probative of the onset of said adverse side effect,”
5/23/2018 libpatent

espect e y equ e t at t e d ag ost c test g s p obat e o  t e o set o  sa d ad e se s de e ect,
“is probative of the concentration of said drug in a tissue of said patient,” and “comprises genetic
testing.” (Ex. 1001 at 18:59—67.)
Both Mitchell and Dix/mm” disclose extensive diagnostic testing, including testing “probative of the
onset of said adverse side effect,” prior to treatment. Thus, both Mifc‘ljell and Dix/mm” teach the
limitations of Claims 7 and 8. Specifically, Mitchell teaches “warnings about the need to have a
negative blood pregnancy test before starting therapy” since birth “malformations [are] associated
with isotretinoin.”
(Ex. 1010 at 101, 103.) Additionally, Dix/mm” discloses that “[t]he NCCC guidelines require extensive
patient evaluation and documentation. A complete physical examination, including laboratory
testing and electrocardiographic analysis, is required.” (Ex. 1007 at 900.)
\With respect to Claim 9, it would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to include,
within the extensive diagnostic testing taught by Mifc‘ljell and Dix/mm”, testing for the drug
concentration in patient tissue. (Ex. 1027 111] 122—23.)
Patent No. 6,315,720 Specifically, for any patient that had previously been treated with the drug, it
would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to conduct diagnostic testing probative of
the concentration of the drug remaining in the patient’s body. (EX. 1027 1] 122.) However, because
many drugs do not generally distribute uniformly in the body, but instead are preferentially absorbed
by certain body tissues, one of ordinary skill in the art would have further recognized the importance
of performing diagnostic testing that would be probative of the concentration of such a non—
uniformly distributing drug in the drug’s target tissues. (EX. 1027 1111 122—23.) See Tyc‘o
Hedlfbme Group LP, 774 F.3d 968, 977 (“Claims would have been obvious if they are nothing more
than a combination of familiar elements that yield predictable results”).
\Vith respect to Claim 10, it would have been further obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art “to
include genetic testing in the extensive diagnostic testing taught by Mme/1 and Dix/1777M.” (EX.
1027 1] 125.) Speci�cally, it was common in the art at the time of the ’720 Patent “to conduct
genetic testing at the same time as the pregnancy testing taught in Mitt/Ml!” (EX. 1027 1] 124.)
Similarly, “[b]ecause there is frequently a genetic component in schizophrenia—the ailment treated
in Dir/1mm”— one of ordinary skill in the art “would have eXpected that the extensive diagnostic
testing in Dix/mm” would have included genetic testing.” (EX.1027 1] 126.) More generally, “because
genetic testing was a well—known diagnostic procedure at the time of the ’720 Patent, it would
have been obvious” to one of ordinary skill in the art “to include genetic testing in the diagnostic
testing that preceded such last—resort
Patent No. 6,315,720 treatments as those disclosed in Mme/1 and Dix/1777M.” (EX. 1027 1] 127.)
See Umgme Lain, Im‘. a. Apofex; Imz, 655 F.3d 1352, 1361 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“This court has observed
that teachings from prior art, suggestions beyond the literal teachings of those art references, or
even motivations from the store of common knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art field (‘TSM’)
—fleXibly viewed and applied—provide the sources of evidence that an ordinary skilled artisan
might have found and combined at the time of the invention”).


4. Dependent Claims 11—14 and 20—25 are obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and more
speci�cally over [Mitchell in View of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.

spec ca y o e  [ tc e   e  o  t e o edge o  o e o  o d a y s   t e a t
Claims 11—14, and 21—25 depend from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the
�eld and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claims 11, 12, and 13 respectively require that
the drug’s associated side effect “is likely to arise in said patient,” “is likely to arise in a foetus carried
by said patient,” and “is likely to arise in a recipient or a foetus carried by a recipient of the bodily
fluid of said patient,” while Claim 14 requires that the claim 12 “recipient is a sexual partner of said
patient.” (EX. 1001 at 19:1—9.) Claim 22 requires that the “drug is thalidomide.” (EX. 1001 at 19:34
—35.) Claim 21 requires that the drug’s associated side effect “comprises a teratogenic effect,” while
Claims 23 and 24 respectively require that the Claim 21 teratogenic effect “is likely to arise in a
foetus carried by said patient,” and “is likely to arise in a foetus carried by a recipient of the bodily
fluid of said patient” and Claim 25 requires that the Claim 24 “recipient of the bodily fluid of said
patient is a sexual
Patent No. 6,315,720 partner of said patient.” (EX. 1001 at 19:32—33, 36—42.) Claim 20 requires
“providing said patient with a contraceptive device or formulation.” (EX. 1001 at 19:30—31.)
Although Mitchell does not explicitly disclose that isotretinoin’s side effects arise in the patient taking
the drug, Mme/1 discloses that its study relates to the drug Accutane. (EX 1010 at 101.) One of
ordinary skill in the art “would have known to look to Accutane’s publicly—available FDA—approved
drug label (included as a package insert with any prescription of the drug) to determine whether
isotretinoin’s side effects arise in the patient taking the drug.” (EX. 1027 1] 132.) The Accutane label
prior to the ’720 Patent’s October 2000 �ling stated in bold: “\VARNINGS: Plya‘ljz'dfrz'c Dz'rordem.‘
Accutane may cause depression, psychosis and rarely, suicidal ideation, suicide attempts and
suicide.” (EX. 1029 at 11.) Thus, “[f] rom Mme/1’ s disclosure, it would have been obvious” to one of
ordinary skill in the art “that isotretinoin’ side effects arise in the patient taking the drug—in the case
of ‘psychiatric disorders’—and also in a fetus carried by the patient taking the drug—in the case of
‘teratogenicity,’” satisfying Claims 11, 12, 21, 22 and 23. (EX. 1010 at 101; EX. 1027 1] 134.)
By the time the ’720 Patent was �led, “it was well known” to those of ordinary skill in the art “that
certain drugs, including thalidomide—disclosed in Mitchell as a drug that could potentially utilize
Mitt/1611’s isotretinoin regime—could be found in semen, and thus could be transmitted to a seXual
partner of a male undergoing treatment with the drug.” (EX. 1010 at 105; EX. 1027 1] 135.) For
eXample, by 1982, Mal/m and Lu�z/d/é—Mdm had discovered that: Patent No. 6,315,720
Thalidomide and tetracycline are drugs known to be strongly absorbed by spermatozoa.
Experiments indicating that thalidomide administered to male rabbits adversely affects the
pregnancy of females mated to these males, for the �rst time drew attention to the until then
unrecognized eventualng of drug—induced pregnancy—wastage occurring by the paternal m.
Subsequently, it was shown that when [14C]thalidomide is administered to male rabbits, the
presence of the radioactive label can be demonstrated in the semen (collected within the arti�cial
vagina) within a short time after ingestion, and is still detectable there some 12 days later.
(Ex. 1018 at 7—8 (emphasis added).) Additionally, in 1997, Vdm‘ljz'm' wrote that “[b]ecause of a
recent study showing thalidomide in rabbit semen and uncertainty about its presence in human


semen, both women and men receiving the drug will be required to use contraception.” (Ex. 1019 at
1.) For this reason, it was obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that a teratogenic drug, such as
5/23/2018 libpatent

) o  t s easo , t as ob ous to o e o  o d a y s   t e a t t at a te atoge c d ug, suc  as
thalidomide, was likely to cause side effects either in a sexual partner of a male being treated with
the drug as in Claims 14, 24, and 25, or in the fetus of this sexual partner as in Claims 13 and 23.
(Ex. 1027 1111 137—38.) See Peifec‘f W617 T661139 Imz, 587 F.3d at 1328 (“Common sense has
long been recognized to inform the analysis of obviousness if explained with suf�cient reasoning”).
The teratogenic risks associated with isotretinoin had been well known since the 1980’s, as Mme/1
discusses at length. (Ex. 1010 at 101 (“The concern about human teratogenicity proved well
founded... reports of pregnancies in exposed
Patent No. 6,315,720 women continued to accumulate, and by 1989 approximately 78 malformed
infants had been reported.”).) For this reason, those of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the ’720
Patent “readily recognized the importance of contraception to patients taking isotretinoin.” (EX. 1027
1] 142.) This is why Mitt/1611’s “Pregnancy—Prevention Program in \‘V omen of Childbearing Age
Receiving lsotretinoin” taught “an aggressive program designed to reduce the risk of pregnancy
among women taking the drug” that included “warnings about the need to have a negative blood
pregnancy test before starting therapy; to wait until the neXt menstrual period before starting
therapy; and to use effective birth control one month before starting therapy, during therapy, and
one month after completing it.” (EX. 1010 at 101, 103.) Mme/1 further taught providing “an
information brochure for patients, contraceptive information, information about and the necessary
forms for a contraception referral program (in which the manufacturer would reimburse patients for
a visit to another physician for contraceptive counseling)” (EX. 1010 at 101.) In light of “Marc/1611’s
teachings, it would have been obvious” to one of ordinary skill in the art “that when the patient
participates in the ‘contraception referral program,’ that doctor will likely provide the ‘patient with a
contraceptive device or formulation’” as in Claim 20, in order “to accomplish Mme/1’ s objective of
ensuring that ‘women of childbearing age’ taking isotretinoin use ‘effective contraception.’” (EX.
1010 at 102; 1027 1] 145.) See Safe/e
P/Jdmd, Imz, 684 F.3d at 1259. See Safe/e P/Jdmd, Im‘. a. Lupin Ltd, 684 F.3d 1253, 1259 (Fed. Cir.
2012) (�nding substantial question of validity because, “‘[i]f a person of
Patent No. 6,315,720 ordinary skill can implement a predictable variation, § 103 likely bars its
patentability’”) (quoting KS R, 550 US. at 417).
5. Dependent Claim 15 is obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and more speci�cally over [Mitchell
in View of Disbman and in further View of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.
Claims 15 depends from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the �eld and obvious
to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claim 15 requires “f. de�ning for each said risk group a second set
of information to be collected from said patient on a period basis; g. obtaining said second set of
information from said patient; and h.
entering said second set of information in said medium before said patient is approved to receive
said drug.” (EX. 1001 at 19:10—18.)
Both Mifc‘ljell and Dix/mm” explicitly disclose de�ning information to be collected and obtaining that
information from the patient on a periodic basis as in Claim 15(1) and (g). For example, Mifc‘ljell


discloses that: Each week, 100 women were randomly assigned to the group interviewed by
telephone. They were contacted three times: at the start of therapy (within one month after

enrollment), when we inquired about the patients’ understanding of the hazards of isotretinoin and
compliance with the program; in the middle of therapy (between two and four months after the start
of the isotretinoin), when we inquired about continued understanding of the hazards of isotretinoin
and compliance with the program; and siX months after the completion of therapy, when we asked
about the occurrence of pregnancy during or after treatment.
Patent No. 6,315,720 (Ex. 1010 at 102.) In addition, Mite/yell teaches that: Women not randomly
assigned to the telephone group were sent a brief questionnaire six months after starting
isotretinoin to determine the date on which they had completed or were expected to complete
therapy.
They were then mailed a questionnaire six months after that date, which included the same
questions as the third telephone interview.
(Ex. 1010 at 102.) Min/yell further teaches that, “[t]o minimize memory loss and biased recall, we
collected information on the behavior of physicians and patients at the start of therapy as well as
during treatment.” (Ex. 1010 at 102.) Additionally, Dix/977m” teaches that “[t]he manufacturer,
Sandoz, requires all prescribers and patients to be registered with the Clozaril National Registry,
which requires weekly monitoring of each patient’s white blood cell (\VBC) count and limits
medication dispensing to a one—week supply.” (Ex. 1007 at 899.)
Dix/977m” further discloses that “[p]hysicians at the NCCC review each clozapine candidate’s �le
before granting approval for use and review weekly tracking sheets that report patient status. [T]he
pharmacist ensures that the psychiatry resident orders the necessary laboratogg tests, performs the
required clinical evaluation, and documents the results in a weekly tracking sheet, which the
pharmacist forwards to the NCCC.” (Ex. 1007 at 900 (emphasis added).) As previously discussed
above with respect to the second portion of Claim 1(c)—Dz'x/977mfi discloses the storage of the
patient’s weekly \VBC count (and other collected information contained in the weekly tracking sheet)
on a computer readable storage medium. (See Ex. 1007 at 899.)
Patent No. 6,315,720 Because Dix/177m” also teaches that this weekly review occurs “before
granting approval for use,” and that its lockout system “will allow clozapine prescriptions to be
processed only when \VBC counts are within the defined limits,” “it would have been obvious” to one
of ordinary skill in the art “that the weekly \VBC test results must be entered in the ‘medium before
said patient is approved to receive said drug,’” as required by Claim 15(h). (EX 1007 at 900; EX. 1027
1111 153—54.) See Peifec‘f W617 Tet/13., Imz, 587 F.3d at 1328.
6. Dependent Claims 16—17 are obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and more speci�cally over
[Mitchell in View of Dishman and in further View of the knowledge of one of ordinary skill in the art.
Claims 16—17 depend from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the �eld and
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claim 16 requires that the Claim 15 second set of
information collected on a periodic basis “comprises a survey regarding said patient’s behavior and
compliance with said risk avoidance measures, while Claim 17 requires that the Claim 16 survey “is
conducted telephonically using an integrated voice response system.” (EX 1001 at 19:19—24.)


Mitchell eXplicitly discloses Claim 16’s requirement of “a survey regarding said patient’s behavior
and compliance with said risk avoidance measures.” For example, Marc/1611’s authors “designed

a d co p a ce t  sa d s  a o da ce easu es  o  e a p e, a c/ 6 s aut o s des g ed
and conducted a survey to assess the compliance of physicians and patients with the program and
to identify the rate of pregnancy during treatment with isotretinoin and during the month after
treatment.” (EX 1010 at 101— 02.) “Early in 1992, the questionnaire was modi�ed to allow more
complete Patent No. 6,315,720 information to be obtained regarding sexual activity and birth
control.” (EX. 1010 at 103.) Mitchell further discloses that, “[a]mong women enrolled in this survey,
understanding of the teratogenic risks of isotretinoin and of the need to avoid pregnancy was
virtually universal. Compliance with other aspects of the program was less complete, although in no
case did compliance for any measure decline during the study period.” (EX. 1010 at 104.)
Further, because one method of conducting the surveys in Mitchell was by telephone, using an
integrated voice response system—which was well known to those of ordinary skill in the art at the
time—as required by Claim 17, would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. (EX 1027
111] 158—61; m, e.g., EX. 1017 at 611—12, 623.) See In 7? Vela/m", 262 F.2d 91, 95 (C.C.P.A. 1958)
(“Furthermore, it is well settled that it is not ‘invention’ to broadly provide a mechanical or automatic
means to replace manual activity which has accomplished the same result”).
7. Dependent Claims 18—19 and 26—27 are obvious over the prior art of Ground 1, and more
speci�cally over [Mitchell in View of Dishman and in further View of the knowledge of one of
ordinary skill in the art.
Claims 18—19 and 26—27 depend from Claim 1, and merely add limitations already known in the
�eld and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claim 18 requires that, where the “patient is a
female of childbearing potentia ,” the Claim 15 second set of information collected on a periodic
basis “comprises the results of a pregnancy test,” while Claim 19 requires that the periodic interval
for the Claim 18
Patent No. 6,315,720 pregnancy test “comprises about 28 days.” (EX. 1001 at 19:25—29.) Claim 26
similarly requires that, where the drug has a teratogenic effect, the “information to be obtained from
said patient” “includes the results of a pregnancy test,” while Claim 27 adds to the requirements of
Claim 26 that “said prescription is �lled for no more than about 28 days.” (EX. 1001 at 19:43—20:2.)
Mme/1 explicitly discloses that, in light of isotretinoin’s “teratogenicity,” women were “warn[ed]
about the need to have a negative blood pregnancy test before starting therapy” and that “78
percent [of women] were told to wait for pregnancy— test results before starting isotretinoin” as
Claim 26 requires. (EX. 1010 at 101— Mitchell further teaches obtaining periodic pregnancy test
results from “women of childbearing age” after isotretinoin treatment has begun: “To identify
compliance with the program and the occurrence of pregnancy, the survey covered the treatment
period and the subsequent siX months, a period long enough to allow identi�cation of pregnancies
occurring as late as the �rst month after discontinuation of treatment.
(EX. 1010 at 102 (emphasis added).) Mme/1 also discloses that “siX months after the completion of
therapy, [the authors] asked about the occurrence of pregnancy during or after treatment,” and
learned that “there were 402 pregnancies during therapy.”


(EX. 1010 at 101—02.) Dix/17mm similarly teaches that, “contraindications to clozapine therapy
include pregnancy,” and so it would have been obvious to one of ordinary Patent No. 6,315,720 skill
5/23/2018 libpatent

in the art to also require a mid—treatment pregnancy test for Dir/mmn’s clozapine patients upon a
missed period. (Ex. 1007 at 900; Ex. 1027 1] 167.)
Although neither reference teaches requiring periodic pregnancy tests before prescribing the next
cycle of drugs, Dix/mm” does teach requiring \VBC tests every week before prescribing the next
week of drugs, as discussed above with respect to Claim 15(h). (Ex. 1007 at 899 (“The
manufacturer, Sandoz, requires all prescribers and patients to be registered with the Clozaril
National Registry, which requires weekly monitoring of each patient’s white blood cell (\VBC) count
and limits medication dispensing to a one—week supply.”).) In light of Mitchell ‘s requirement for
excluding pregnancy by “a negative blood pregnancy before starting therapy” it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art to apply Mz'h‘lje/Z s pregnancy test requirement to
Dix/den’s periodic testing before prescription requirement, satisfying Claim 18. (Ex. 1010 at 103; Ex.
1027 11169.) See KSR Im’l Ca, 550 US. at 417.
“Although Dix/me’s system requires testing every 7 days, and correspondingly only allows patients
to �ll 7—day supply prescriptions, it was well known to one of ordinary skill in the art that women
may only become pregnant once during every 28— day menstrual cycle. In light of this fact, when
implementing Dix/Jifiom’s periodic testing requirement to pregnancy testing, it would have been
obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the proper testing period for pregnancy is about 28
days, as Claim 19 requires.” (Ex. 1027 1] 170.) See Safe/e P/Jdmd, Imz, 684 F.3d at 1259.
“Further, applying Dix/mmn’s one—to—one correspondence between testing intervals
Patent No. 6,315,720 and prescription supplies, it would consequently have been obvious to one of
ordinary skill in the art to �ll prescriptions ‘for no more than about 28 days,’” as in Claim 27. (EX.
1027 11171.) See KSR Inf! Ca, 550 US. at 417 (“[l]fa technique has been used to improve one device,
and an ordinarily skilled artisan would recognize that it would improve similar devices in the same
way, using the technique is obvious unless its actual application is beyond his or her skill”).
8. The added limitations of independent Claim 28 and dependent Claims 29—32 are obvious over
M’tcnell in View of Disnman and in further View of Cunningham and knowledge of one of ordinary
skill in the art.
Claim 28, although an independent claim, merely repeats the language of Claim 1 with a single
added limitation already known in the �eld and obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art. Claims 29
—32 depend from Claim 28, and similarly add limitations already known in the �eld and obvious to
one of ordinary skill in the art.
Claim 28(a)—(e) maps precisely to Claim 1(a)—(e), and so is obvious for the reasons eXplained
above with respect to Claim 1(a)—(e). In addition, Claim 28 requires that “said adverse side effect is
likely to arise in patients who take said drug in combination with at least one other drug.” (EX. 1001
at 203—31.) Claims 29 and 30 respectively require that the “information to be obtained from said
patient” “is also probative of the likelihood that said patient may take said drug and said other drug
in combination,” and “includes the results of diagnostic testing,” while Claims 31 and 32 respectively
require that the Claim 30 diagnostic testing “comprises testing for


Patent No. 6,315,720 evidence of the use of said other drug” and “comprises testing for evidence
which is indicative of the onset of said adverse event.” (Ex. 1001 at 20:32—42.)
5/23/2018 libpatent


https://libpatent.com/ptab/docket/89106/IPR2015-01103/Petition-for-Inter-Partes-Review-of-US-Patent-No-6315720 26/39


c  s d cat e o  t e o set o  sa d ad e se e e t  (  00  at 0 3 )
It would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that the adverse effects described in
Mz'fc‘ljell and Dz'xljwm—“teratogenicity” and “agranulocytosis”— would have also been “‘likely to
arise in patients who take said drug in combination with at least one other drug,’” as required by
Claim 28. (EX.1010 at 101 ; Ex. 1007 at 899; Ex. 1027 1] 175.) See Peifec‘f W617 Tec/Jx., Imz, 587
F.3d at 1328.
As previously discussed with respect to Claims 7 and 8, both Mz'fc‘ljell and Dix/17mm disclose
extensive diagnostic testing, including testing “indicative of the onset of said adverse side effect,”
prior to treatment. Thus, both Mitchell and Dix/17mm teach the limitations of Claims 30 and 32.
Speci�cally, Mz'fc‘ljell teaches “the need to have a negative blood pregnancy test before starting
therapy” because of “the drug’s teratogenic risk.” (Ex. 1010 at 103, 105.) Additionally, Dix/mm”
discloses that “[t]he NCCC guidelines require extensive patient evaluation and documentation. A
complete physical examination, including laboratory testing and electrocardiographic analysis, is
required.” (EX. 1007 at 900.)
\With respect to Claims 29 and 31, it was well known to those of ordinary skill in the art at the time
of the ’720 Patent that the interactions among drug combinations, also termed “drug—drug
interactions,” could cause serious and even lethal adverse side effects. (EX. 1027 1] 180.) “For
example, in 1983, S/Jz'lm states that ‘[d] rug [i]nteractions are a clearly de�ned problem that we as
health professionals
Patent No. 6,315,720 must deal with on a day—by—day basis.’ (Ex. 1020 at 205.) In 1993,
Lz'mwxxon further explained that ‘potential drug interactions occur in 12% of patients at risk (those
receiving two or more concurrent drugs), and that 1.9% of all drug prescriptions result in a potential
drug interaction.’ (Ex. 1021 at132.) Still by 1997, Grammy lamented that ’[d] rug interactions may
lead to life—threatening injuries.’ (Ex. 1022 at 13; Ex. 1027 1111 181—83.) As such, it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art that during the pre—treatment “extensive patient
evaluation” and “complete physical examination” disclosed, for example, in Dir/mm”, information
regarding any other drugs that the patient was taking would have been collected in order to screen
for potential contraindicated drug combinations, as required by Claim 29. (Ex. 1007 at 900; Ex. 1027
1] 184.) See In re Kd/Jfi, 441 F.3d 977, 988 (Fed. Cir. 2006) (holding that “the understandings and
knowledge of persons having ordinary skill in the art at the time of the invention I] support the legal
conclusion of obviousness.”).
\Vith respect to Claim 31, it is important to note that Dix/Jifiom’s regimen is designed for treating
schizophrenics. (EX.1007 at 899.) It was well known to ordinarily skilled artisans that substance
abuse is prevalent among schizophrenics. (Ex. 1027 111] 190—92.) For example, Soy/€51 concluded
in 1992 that “substance abuse is a very common problem in schizophrenics.” (Ex. 1023 at 362.)
Similarly, Hdwem wrote in 1995 that “[t]he high prevalence of substance use, e.g., alcohol and illegal
and nonprescribed drugs, in schizophrenia is widely recognized.” (Ex. 1024 at 559.) Again, in 1997,
Karim and Zz'edordx wrote that “[m]ost individuals with schizophrenia have Patent No. 6,315,720
problems with abuse of substances ranging from licit substances, such as nicotine, to illicit ones,


such as cocaine,” and further explained that “[s]everal recent studies have demonstrated that up to
50 percent of individuals with schizophrenia have either alcohol or illicit drug dependence, and
5/23/2018 libpatent


https://libpatent.com/ptab/docket/89106/IPR2015-01103/Petition-for-Inter-Partes-Review-of-US-Patent-No-6315720 27/39


50 pe ce t o  d dua s t  sc op e a a e e t e  a co o  o  c t d ug depe de ce, a d
about 70 percent or more are nicotine dependent.” (Ex. 1025 at 181.) However, Dix/mm” indicates
that its clozapine regime may be contraindicated for those with substance abuse problems. (Ex.
1007 at 900 (“The NCCC also recommends that clozapine not be used in patients who, because of
social situation, substance abuse, or other factors, cannot be relied upon to keep follow—up
appointments”) (emphasis added).)
Because the prevalence of substance abuse among schizophrenics was well known, it would have
been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the ’720 Patent that, during the pre—
treatment “extensive patient evaluation” and “complete physical examination” disclosed in Dix/mm”,
a practitioner should test for the regimen’s contraindicated substance abuse by screening for the
presence of alcohol and other drugs. (Ex. 1027 1] 188.) See Pm" P11517771, Im‘. a. TW?
1365177775., Imz, 773 F.3d 1186, 1197 (2014) (“[T]he motivation to combine does not have to be
explicitly stated in the prior art, and can be supported by testimony of an expert witness regarding
knowledge of a person of skill in the art at the time of invention”).
However, as Mme/1 teaches, “[i]n a survey of self—reports, one must ask whether the information is
valid.” (Ex. 1010 at 105.) Indeed, because it was well known to an ordinarily skilled artisan that, as
the National Center on Addiction and
Patent No. 6,315,720 Substance Abuse at Columbia University stated in 1994 “people are generally
reluctant
”3 it would have been obvious to one to admit to alcohol or drug abuse and addiction, of ordinary
skill in the art that a substance abuse screen in Dix/17mm should have comprised “testing for
evidence of the use of” alcohol or other drugs, rather than solely relying on patient survey
information. (EX 1026 at 4; EX. 1027 1111 190, 192.) See Safe/e P/Jdmd, Imz, 684 F.3d at 1259 (Fed.
Cir. 2012) (“The obviousness analysis entails ‘an expansive and flexible approach.’. . .There need not
be ‘precise teachings directed
to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim, for a court can take account of the inferences
and creative steps that a POSA would employ.”’) (quoting KS R, 550 US. at 418). Thus, Claim 31’s
limitations would have been obvious to one of ordinary skill in the art at the time of the ’720 Patent.
(EX 1027 1111 180—92.)
3 Similarly, in a 1993 study, Walk and Rune/Z eXplained that “[s]ocially desirable responding is the
reluctance to admit unpopular beliefs or behavior in order to avoid making a negative impression. It
poses a problem for researchers who rely on self— report of heavy drinking and drug use. ... It was
concluded that social desirability response bias probably results in underestimates of rates of heavy
drinking and drug use ...” (EX. 1032 at 758.)
