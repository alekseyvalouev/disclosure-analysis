Summary:  Genworth Financial (GNW)
Genworth’s proposed acquirer, China Oceanwide, looks to be in the midst of a deep


liquidity crunch.


Following multiple FOIA requests, we were able to locate audits for the opaque Chinese


conglomerate that show consistently negative cash �ow and debt levels spiking to clearly


unsustainable levels.


We see almost no chance of regulators approving this deal. Doing so would hand control


of Genworth’s  assets to a faltering entity in a jurisdiction with limited recourse.


A deep dive into Genworth’s insurance carriers show that the company looks starkly


under-reserved. Our analysis indicates that Genworth’s LTC exposure is under-reserved


by at least $9.9 billion.


Overall we see this deal failing followed by an unwinding of Genworth. We’ve taken a


signi�cant short position in Genworth’s equity.

Genworth: We See Almost No Chance Of
Regulatory Approval. This Deal Would Be A
Disaster For Policyholders


Published on November 1, 2018

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
In October 2016 Genworth announced (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2016/China-Oceanwide-To-Acquire-Genworth-Financial/default.aspx)


that it would be acquired by China Oceanwide, an opaque private conglomerate based in


mainland China. The deal has lingered for two years and despite Delaware


(http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-releases/archive/archive/2018/Delaware-


Department-of-Insurance-Schedules-Public-Hearing-on-China-Oceanwide-and-Genworth-


Financial-Merger-on-November-28-2018/default.aspx) recently scheduling a hearing on the


matter we think regulatory approvals will never make it over the line.


We were able to locate audits for the private China Oceanwide conglomerate following multiple


Freedom of Information Act requests to various state departments of insurance. China


Oceanwide’s �nances show that operating and investing cash �ow have been consistently


negative over the past �ve years and have recently deteriorated further. Debt has skyrocketed


to clearly unsustainable levels.


A subsequent review of Chinese �lings shows that the conglomerate has also pledged equity in


its subsidiaries for loans, e�ectively levering the enterprise to the hilt. Given this combination


of negative cash �ow coupled with spiking debt levels we believe China Oceanwide is poised to


become the next Chinese conglomerate meltdown a la HNA Group or Anbang Insurance.


In light of these �ndings, we think this deal would create the sort of asset/liability mismatch


that gravely threatens Genworth’s policyholders. It would give China Oceanwide control over


Genworth’s assets, which could serve as a much-needed liquidity lifeline for the conglomerate.


Meanwhile, the vast majority of Genworth’s liabilities (i.e. future claims by policyholders) would


be based domestically in the U.S.


This would make the deal incredibly dangerous for U.S. policyholders given the cross-border


enforcement issues between the U.S. and China. The dynamic would make it virtually


impossible for regulators to approve what looks to be a disaster in the making.


All of this raises an inevitable question however—what is the back-up plan for Genworth if the


deal fails? The options look thin.


When asked by the JP Morgan analyst on the Q2 conference call


(https://seekingalpha.com/article/4193094-genworth-�nancial-gnw-q2-2018-results-earnings-


call-transcript?part=single) what happens in case the deal isn’t approved, Genworth’s


executives basically sidestepped the question and said they were 100% focused on this deal.


They then suggested any back-up plan would likely include asset sales.

Genworth has been a habitually underperforming insurance operator and our review indicates


that it continues to be severely under-reserved. We performed a deep-dive analysis of


Genworth’s GLIC carrier and estimate that its existing long-term care (LTC) exposure is under-


reserved by $9.9 billion.


Management’s position is that they are done adding capital to GLIC. We do not see this as


realistic. We are hard-pressed to �nd examples of insurance holding companies that have left


carriers for bankruptcy/receivership without experiencing adverse e�ects. With a market cap of


$2 billion and long-term borrowings of about $4 billion (pg. 3


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1276520/000119312518234958/d610750d10q.htm)),


we believe adequate reserving would leave Genworth’s equityholders with nothing and would


wipe out its bondholders.

(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1276520/000119312518234958/d610750d10q.htm)),


we believe adequate reserving would leave Genworth’s equity holders with nothing and would


wipe out its bondholders.


In the end we think regulators are left with 2 unsavory choices: does Genworth fail domestically


or does it fail internationally? Policyholders would be better o� with a domestic insolvency


versus a di�cult cross-border wind-down but either scenario would obviously be a mess


regardless.


The Proposed Genworth Deal Echoes Other
Failed Transactions Involving Chinese
Conglomerates


The proposed China Oceanwide transaction echoes those of other recent Chinese


conglomerates that had embarked on ill-fated foreign deal sprees:


Anbang. In 2015 Anbang insurance attempted to purchase U.S. insurer Fidelity &


Guaranty amidst an aggressive overseas expansion. Much like with Genworth/China


Oceanwide, the deal managed clear CFIUS approval (https://www.reuters.com/article/us-


�delityguarantylife-m-a-anbang/exclusive-anbangs-�delity-guaranty-acquisition-set-to-fall-

then took over the enterprise. Anbang is now managed by o�cials from Chinese �nancial


regulators and government bodies.


HNA Group. HNA is a Chinese conglomerate with an insurance subsidiary


(https://www.ft.com/content/43de5590-af3c-11e7-beba-5521c713abf4) that has turned


into the largest debt-laden pending failure the nation has seen. HNA went on a $40 billion


overseas acquisition spree, buying up assets ranging from Hilton Worldwide to a large


stake in Deutsche Bank. Chinese authorities eventually clamped down on internal control


issues (https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/2114966/chinas-regulator-

China Oceanwide Looks To Be In The Midst of a
Deep Liquidity Crunch


Similar to warning signs with Anbang and HNA, a review of China Oceanwide’s byzantine


corporate structure shows that the conglomerate looks to be facing stark liquidity pressures of


its own.


China Oceanwide is a private entity and therefore we were unable to �nd detailed �nancial


information via Chinese sources. However, we �led FOIA requests with �ve departments of


insurance involved in the deal. None responded with documents except the Virginia


Department of Insurance (http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch#caseDocs/136799), which


made China Oceanwide’s audits and related documents available. (For context, China


Oceanwide is the entity proposing to complete the Genworth transaction.) Per the org chart

The past 5 years of China Oceanwide’s operating performance show an organization in decline.


China Oceanwide has consistently produced large negative operating and investing cash �ows.


In the absence of organic cash generation it has been supported by cash from �nancing


activities, which largely consisted of net debt issuance:

With operating cash �ow worsening and with a massive stack of $11b+ of short-term debt


coming due we think China Oceanwide’s situation is approaching near-term crisis levels.


China Oceanwide Has Been Aggressively
Pledging Shares of Its Public Subsidiaries As
Loan Collateral


When further examining the China Oceanwide conglomerate we see additional warning signs


underscoring its excessive use of leverage.


Oceanwide Holdings Co. (ticker: 000046.SZ) is the conglomerate’s key publicly traded entity. See


the org-chart below (as originally �led


(http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3m0d01!.PDF) with the Virginia Department of


Insurance) to get a sense of the cross-ownership and the importance Oceanwide Holdings Co.


has to the broader China Oceanwide empire:

Oceanwide Holdings Co’s S&P rating currently stands at CCC+


(https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/type/HTML/id/2109124),


placing it deep within speculative territory. S&P de�nes


(https://www.standardandpoors.com/en_US/web/guest/article/-/view/sourceId/504352) CCC


ratings as being “currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable


business, �nancial, and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its �nancial commitments.”


Fitch recently lowered its rating (https://www.�tchratings.com/site/pr/10032245) on Oceanwide


Holdings Co to B-. Fitch de�nes (https://www.�tchratings.com/site/dam/jcr:6b03c4cd-611d-


47ec-b8f1-183c01b51b08/Rating) it’s ‘B’ rating as situations where a “material default risk is


present, but a limited margin of safety remains”.

egarding its rating:


“Oceanwide’s liquidity remains very weak and its capital structure is unsustainable.”


S&P’s release at one point vaguely suggested that the parent—China Oceanwide—might be


able to support the entity, underscoring how misunderstood the overall conglomerate has


been even to ratings agencies:

“We may raise the rating if Oceanwide can meaningfully deleverage or improve its


capital structure. This could happen if…the company can raise more equity or longer-


term funding, including higher support from its parent.”


Despite S&P speculating that the parent company might be able to support Oceanwide


Holdings it actually looks like the opposite is true. Parent China Oceanwide has pledged the


vast majority of its stake in the ailing Oceanwide Holdings subsidiary—about 93.6% of its


holdings—as collateral for its own loans.


We can see this from Oceanwide Holdings’ �rst half 2018 �nancial report (pg. 45


(http://www.cninfo.com.cn/�nalpage/2018-08-31/1205361843.PDF)). Parent China Oceanwide


owns 3.526 billion shares of Oceanwide Holdings, and it has already pledged 3.301 billion


shares, or about 93.6% of the total shares it owns as of June 2018.


Share pledges are an inherently unstable source of lending collateral because if share prices


drop the borrower could face additional collateral calls. If no additional collateral is available


such a scenario could eventually lead to an unraveling via forced liquidation. As shown below,


the share price of Oceanwide Holdings has steadily declined over the past several years:

well. See the org chart for where these entities sit relative to the broader organization:

Disclosures are murky on COHL but China Oceanwide looks to have pledged its shares in this

However, �lings as of May 18, 2018 showed that Haitong International owned 58.19% of the


company. It is obvious that the math does not add up in here. The overlapping ownership


claims are likely to be due to a share pledge on this entity similar to the disclosed pledge


between Haitong and China Tonghai described above.


The share price for COHL has also traded steadily lower:

“…the issued shares of two subsidiaries of the Company were also pledged to secure


borrowings of the Group as at 30 June 2018 (31 December 2017: Nil).” (pg. 24


(http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2018/0830/LTN201808301421.pdf


))


Overall, the entire China Oceanwide organizational structure looks levered to the hilt from top


to bottom. The share prices for all 3 public companies in the conglomerate have declined


precipitously in the past 3 years, which strikes us as an incredibly unstable scenario.


Recent Modi�cations To The Proposed Deal
Structure Give Us No Con�dence In China
Oceanwide As A Credible Counterparty


In light of the above signs of illiquidity and leverage, recent changes to the Genworth deal


structure give us further doubts about the viability of this deal.

As of August 14  (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Genworth-and-Oceanwide-Extend-Merger-Agreement-


6db73a1f8/default.aspx) Genworth and China Oceanwide agreed to a 6  extension of their


proposed merger. Whereas past extensions had mostly been focused on a simple lengthening


of the closing timeline, the latest extension has proposed signi�cant modi�cations to the deal


structure itself. We think these modi�cations are yet another re�ection of China Oceanwide’s


deteriorating liquidity.


In particular, earlier deal structures required Oceanwide to contribute $525 million to facilitate


the “unstacking” of Genworth Life and Annuity Insurance Company (GLAIC) from Genworth Life


Insurance Company (GLIC). Earlier structures also required Oceanwide to contribute $600


million to Genworth for the repayment of Genworth’s debt obligations due May 2018. Both of


these up-front cash conditions were waived (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Genworth-and-Oceanwide-Extend-Merger-Agreement-


6db73a1f8/default.aspx).


Instead, Oceanwide has agreed to a capital investment plan that would allow it to contribute


$1.5 billion “over time following consummation of the merger”, with �nal amounts to be


contributed by March 31, 2020, well after the targeted deal closing. The proposed deferred


capital infusion strikes us as a dubious proposition given the state of China Oceanwide’s


�nancials.


When digging further into the details of the new proposed deal structure


(http://www.scc.virginia.gov/docketsearch/DOCS/3nrx01!.PDF) (again through the Virginia DoI


�lings) we see how rickety the revised proposal really looks. It contemplates 2 funding


“channels”. The �rst is described as “the same as the Original Funding structure” and includes


cash from 3 of the mainland Chinese entities listed in the above org charts. According to the


revised proposal this Original Funding channel is to provide only 35% of the aggregate merger


consideration.


The second (and new) channel involves recently-formed o�shore British Virgin Islands (BVI)


entities. This channel is to provide 65% of the aggregate merger consideration. Per the revised


proposal this part of the transaction could be funded by bridge loans involving yet more


pledged assets:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
We are unnerved by the fact that Oceanwide and Genworth are suggesting new, o�shore


funding channels that are potentially backed by a�liated bridge loans in a conglomerate that is


already levered to the edge. The notion that such funding is to comprise almost 2/3 of the total


merger consideration strikes us as grasping at straws.


Genworth’s Recent Deferred Contribution Plan
Strikes Us As A Lame Attempt to Buy Approval
From Delaware


Earlier this week Genworth announced (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Delaware-Department-of-Insurance-Schedules-Public-Hearing-


on-China-Oceanwide-and-Genworth-Financial-Merger-on-November-28-2018/default.aspx) that


it would be contributing $175 million from its holding company to its Delaware carrier. Similar


to China Oceanwide’s deferred contribution plan, Genworth proposed making these payments


after the hoped-for deal closing.


We view this as little other than an attempt to rearrange the furniture on the Hindenburg. Any


holding company cash that goes to a Delaware carrier is cash that won’t go to their other


carriers. Genworth needs approval from multiple jurisdictions in order to close the deal.


Genworth’s Long-Term Care Liabilities
Represent a Near-Term Problem


In either case, we don’t think Genworth or China Oceanwide’s deferred contribution promises


will make the di�erence. Genworth acknowledged in its Q2 earnings presentation that results


in its LTC book of business from the �rst half of the year “re�ect higher severity and frequency


on new claims.” (pg. 8 (http://s2.q4cdn.com/240635966/�les/doc_�nancials/2018/q2/Genworth-

In the most recent Q3 release (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Genworth-Financial-Announces-Third-Quarter-2018-


Results/default.aspx) Genworth reiterated that results “re�ected lower terminations and higher


severity and frequency of new claims” which were partially o�set by premium hikes and bene�t


cuts.


We also see that the company is deferring its annual LTC review from Q3 to Q4, which we view


as strongly negative signaling:


“The company has typically conducted a review of its LTC claims reserve assumptions


in the third quarter of each year but this year will be completing its review in the


fourth quarter.”


Per the conference call, the company’s stated reason for the delay is that they are


“contemplating methodology changes” and that “given the complexity of these potential


changes, signi�cant review is required.”


We �nd it troubling that Genworth is looking to defer its LTC claims reserve assumptions at a


time when (a) they acknowledge that claims have experienced higher severity and frequency


and (b) when they acknowledge trying to close this deal in Q4.


Frankly, this strikes us as an attempt to avoid taking an obvious reserve adjustment (and


capital impairment) in order to grease the deal through.


We Expect Genworth’s Long-Term Care Book
Will Sink The Company Regardless Of Who
Owns It


Our review of Genworth’s statutory insurance �lings show that a massive long-term care


liability looms.


As has been widely reported, long-term care insurance has become an anchor on the entire


insurance industry. Earlier this year, GE identi�ed


(https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-25/ge-s-surprise-15-billion-shortfall-was-


14-years-in-the-making) a $15 billion reserve shortfall in its legacy LTC book. The news sent GE’s

shares down sharply and triggered an SEC investigation


(https://money.cnn.com/2018/01/24/investing/ge-sec-investigation-insurance-


accounting/index.html) to review the situation more closely.


Genworth was formed in 2004 as a result of GE Capital spinning-o� most of its life, LTC and


mortgage insurance products. The perception at the time among many industry experts


(https://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/19/business/worldbusiness/ge-to-sell-insurance-business-


to-swiss-re.html) and commentators (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-


business/genworth-debut-falls-�at-as-investors-shun-ge-spino�/article18265737/) was that the


Genworth IPO represented an attempt to minimize the damage from GE’s problematic


insurance exposure.


Years after its IPO (http://money.cnn.com/2004/05/25/markets/ipo/genworth/), Genworth’s


stock subsequently cratered (https://www.newsadvance.com/news/local/genworth-stock-


plummets-after-company-sets-aside-more-insurance-reserves/article_150e442c-65ee-11e4-


b7fd-0017a43b2370.html) as under-reserving issues began to manifest. The company paid


$219 million (http://www.investmentnews.com/article/20160314/FREE/160319971/genworth-


to-pay-219m-to-settle-securities-lawsuit-related-to-long) in 2016 to settle a lawsuit that alleged


under-reserving in its long term care portfolio.


Despite Genworth punishing its policyholders with recent premium rate increases ranging from


50%-150% (https://www.wsj.com/articles/millions-bought-insurance-to-cover-retirement-


health-costs-now-they-face-an-awful-choice-1516206708) our analysis indicates that


Genworth’s LTC book is still severely under-reserved.


A Deep Dive Into Genworth’s LTC Exposure
Indicates Severe Reserving De�ciencies


We performed a detailed peer reserving analysis of Genworth’s GLIC carrier to get a sense of its


reserving situation.


Note that Genworth is one of the few insurance providers that writes new LTC business. New


policies can take decades to pay out new claims and therefore can mask underlying reserving


problems taking place in more seasoned policies. Therefore, in order to perform a comparable


analysis we isolated older vintage policies and compared the reserving of those policies relative


to peers of a similar vintage.

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Our analysis isolates Genworth’s pre-2003 policies and compares their reserving practices


against peers in order to see whether Genworth has safely managed its risk in this oft-


troublesome cohort.


Pre-2003 serves as a relevant marker because multiple other carriers have also acknowledged


that their pre-2003 long-term care policies have been particularly problematic (pg. 24


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1224608/000122460818000011/cno1231201710-


k.htm) and pg. 1 (https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122826822305174269)). This was due to the


loose underwriting standards of the era as these policies were sold amidst a period of intense


market competition and a ‘land grab’ by multiple carriers for new LTC business.


Genworth has recently become more vulnerable to these pre-2003 policies due to the


expiration of reinsurance protection this year. Genworth’s reinsurance agreement had covered


new claims on policies written between 1998-2003, per GLIC’s 2017 statutory MD&A (pg. 7


(https://www.slideshare.net/secret/4F2BQPg7TzhZ3D)). As of this year however, any new claims


on these blocks become the full responsibility of Genworth.


Reserving across competing LTC insurance carriers in this time frame should fall within a


similar range given the comparable vintages and the competitive marketplace dynamics at the


time, despite some di�erences in the nuances of coverage for each policy type.


Contrary to expectation however, the divergence between Genworth’s LTC carriers and its


peers is extreme. Genworth Life (its largest and most signi�cant carrier) holds well less than


half of the per-policy LTC reserves of major carriers like Metlife, Allianz, and Prudential:

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
As shown above, in the pre-2003 cohort Genworth reserves a paltry $29,000 per policy


compared to well-established peers that reserve as high as $121,000 per policy. If per-policy


reserving were improved to a more reasonable $50,000 per policy, we estimate that the


Genworth Life Insurance carrier would require an additional $9.9 billion in reserves. Keep in


mind that $50,000 per policy would barely place Genworth within range of its better-reserved


peers:


(Source: NAIC annual reports and author analysis)


If the reserving were adjusted to $75,000 per policy or even $100,000 per policy we would


possibly be talking about the largest insurance reserving shortfall in history. Rate increases can


bridge some of this gap but it is clearly a major shortfall to cover.

As a reminder, this analysis is merely limited to pre-2003 long-term care policies at one of


Genworth’s carriers. Typically, when one major policy cohort is materially under-reserved we


see similar issues across a company’s other carriers and policy lines. Su�ce it to say we think


Genworth’s carriers are in deep trouble—this strikes us as not even a close call.


Genworth’s Mortgage Businesses Are Exposed
to Increasing Cyclical Risks


We think Genworth is insolvent just purely based on its LTC book of business. But putting aside


LTC for the moment, Genworth’s current top performing business is mortgage insurance which


is largely focused on markets in Canada, the U.S., and Australia. Mortgage insurance is a cyclical


business that has performed well in the low interest rate environment we’ve experienced for


the past 9 years. However, with rates rising this product line is slated to face the tail end of a


business cycle for the �rst time in almost a decade.


Canada and Australia are two markets that have widely been reported as being in the midst of


real estate bubbles. Any trouble in these housing markets could prove to be major headwinds


for Genworth’s mortgage insurance business.


Canada


Canada’s housing bubble has been covered extensively in the press with reports that the


bubble has begun to unravel. In February the FT wrote a piece entitled “Canada’s housing


market �irts with disaster (https://www.ft.com/content/8cb9f0fa-0a61-11e8-839d-


41ca06376bf2)”. Later in June, the Globe and Mail ominously wrote: “The housing bubble is


leaking air, but it’s just a start (https://www.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/editorials/article-


globe-editorial-the-housing-bubble-is-leaking-air-but-its-just-a/).” Since then, numerous


publications have honed in on the rise of subprime mortgages


(https://business.�nancialpost.com/real-estate/mortgages/for-3-4-million-subprime-canadians-


poloz-cant-go-slowly-enough), the clampdown on money laundering in the real estate sector


(https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/globe-investigation-into-money-laundering-


in-bc-real-estate-will-lead-to-new-rules-ag-says/article38018921/), and other issues that appear


to be reaching a breaking point.


Australia

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/privacy/

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
The Australia property market is similarly on shaky footing. Home prices have dropped year


over year (https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwake/2018/07/23/5-reasons-home-prices-are-


falling-in-australia/#d3bb3aa2e54c) and numerous outlets such as the New York Times


(https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/17/world/australia/sydney-melbourne-housing-costs.html)


and local Australian media (http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-17/australian-housing-crash-


why-you-should-worry/9336082) have been calling attention to the bursting of a bubble.


While predictions of bubbles can be speculative and subject to high degrees of uncertainty, any


broader economic downtrend will have a negative impact on this key line of business for


Genworth.


In the end we think the LTC business is Genworth’s biggest problem by a wide margin, but any


loss of support from other lines of business could hasten a decline.


The CFIUS Review Is A Meaningless Milestone
That The Market Has Mispriced


Genworth announced in June that the proposed deal with China Oceanwide had cleared its


review with the Treasury Department’s Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States


(CFIUS). Many investors had apparently viewed the CFIUS review as a major hurdle; Genworth’s


stock soared over 26% the day after the announcement


(http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-releases/archive/archive/2018/Committee-on-


Foreign-Investment-in-the-United-States-Completes-Review-of-Proposed-China-Oceanwide-


and-Genworth-Financial-Transaction/default.aspx).


We view the CFIUS review as among the least signi�cant hurdles facing this transaction. CFIUS


reviews are focused on national security (https://www.lw.com/thoughtLeadership/overview-


CFIUS-process) concerns. Their objectives are to ensure that critical technological or physical


infrastructure remain out of the hands of foreign adversaries, and that funds from an acquired


business remain out of the hands of sanctioned countries. Neither were really at issue here.


Per Genworth’s CEO on the Q1 conference call (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4168567-


genworth-�nancial-gnw-q1-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single):


“…They’re really not looking at the �nancial aspects of the deal. Their whole focus is


on national security interests.”

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
As mentioned above, Chinese conglomerate Anbang insurance serves as a precedent. Anbang’s


attempt to purchase U.S. insurer Fidelity & Guaranty in 2015 managed to clear CFIUS approval


(https://www.reuters.com/article/us-�delityguarantylife-m-a-anbang/exclusive-anbangs-�delity-


guaranty-acquisition-set-to-fall-through-sources-idUSKBN17I0QG), but later failed


(https://www.wsj.com/articles/�delity-guaranty-walks-away-from-1-6-billion-anbang-buyout-


1492467044) after New York regulators chose not to approve the combination.


We Predict Regulatory Pushback Will End This
Deal


New York and Delaware have reputations as being among the more diligent state insurance


departments. Neither state has approved despite the transaction having been announced


(http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-releases/archive/archive/2016/China-


Oceanwide-To-Acquire-Genworth-Financial/default.aspx) about 2 years ago. Delaware recently


scheduled a public hearing (http://investor.genworth.com/investors/news-


releases/archive/archive/2018/Delaware-Department-of-Insurance-Schedules-Public-Hearing-


on-China-Oceanwide-and-Genworth-Financial-Merger-on-November-28-2018/default.aspx) on


the proposed merger which we view as inconclusive.


Beyond the U.S., China hasn’t blessed this transaction either. Recently, Chinese o�cials have


made a concerted e�ort to limit overseas investments in order to curb “irrational


(https://foreignpolicy.com/2017/10/17/its-no-accident-that-chinas-tycoons-are-bad-investors/)”


investments and to prevent capital �ight from the country. This strikes us as the precise type of


irrational investment that would seem to �t those characteristics.


All told, we see almost no realistic chance that regulators approve the completion of this deal.


Conclusion: A Rock And A Hard Place


Regulators are faced with a tough choice here because both options (deal or no deal) would


probably spell insolvency for Genworth:


As an acquired entity, Genworth’s shaky �nancials would be inserted into an overseas


empire that itself looks to be crumbling under liquidity pressures. Approving the


transaction would essentially hand control of a massive and liquid portfolio of


policyholder assets over to an opaque foreign conglomerate. The potential for abuse in


such a scenario is high, and hurdles to any cross-border legal remedy would likely leave


U.S. policyholders in a perilous position. A Genworth acquisition wouldn’t save ChinaPrivacy  - Terms

https://www.google.com/intl/en/policies/terms/
Oceanwide, though we think it would buy them some additional time before turning into


an even bigger mess.


As a standalone entity, Genworth seems hopelessly under-reserved and highly levered.


Genworth’s backup plan if the deal fails looks to be virtually non-existent. As noted above,


when asked on the recent Q2 conference call (https://seekingalpha.com/article/4193094-


genworth-�nancial-gnw-q2-2018-results-earnings-call-transcript?part=single) what


happens in case the deal isn’t approved, Genworth suggested any back-up plan would


likely include raising capital through asset sales.


Out of all the parties to this proposed deal the most obvious bene�ciaries we could �nd are the


executives of Genworth. The original merger agreement detailed an estimated $42 million in


Golden Parachute compensation for 5 of Genworth’s executive o�cers. (Pg. 98


(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1276520/000119312517017271/d267031ddefm14a.


htm))


In the end we think there is almost no chance that this deal succeeds. The burden of the denial


decision will probably fall on the Delaware and New York insurance regulators given that


Genworth’s major carriers are domiciled in their states.


If the deal falls part we think under-reserving and liquidity realities will quickly come to bear on


Genworth.


Best of luck to all either way.

the improving pro�t of gnw should help in this consirpacy to torpdo gnw merger intentions.


NY,will require a di�erent set of rules for the deal. and its subsidery co will have to do this.but a


DE approval would certainl;y help for the other 48 states. DE is a key state and several others


have approved In merger acquirments in the past approvals has a in the over 50 yrs of nvesting


and owner of 10 k shares tremendous e�ect on all other states De. is a sink or swim deal and


gnw will not take it lightly for approval. Ive considered what happens if merger is not approved-


with improved pro�t etc the balance sheet looks good and servivalable gnw has seen good


napp earnings earnings for 2018 so far and cash looks su�cient to pay current debts with cash


left over Either way with the merger i am sats�ed .

It is now due again and I am starting to research and �nd out why. I am not sure what to do
