Context of current news: 
The #1 news story of this week so far has been Glaxo’s widespread fraud throughout 
China that allowed them to grow sales through a system of bribes and kickbacks.    
 
Citron read the story on Bloomberg, which stated that Glaxo’s double digit growth in 
China was an outlier compared to its results in other emerging markets.  We 
immediately saw the parallel to USANA (NASDAQ:USNA), which has the same outlying 
growth metrics for a region it deems “Greater China”.

http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/epic/gsk/10192777/GlaxoSmithKline-briefs-Serious-Fraud-
Office-over-China-case.html 





It is Citron’s opinion that Glaxo’s problems in China are an ominous predictor of 
USANA’s corporate misdeeds unraveling soon.  So this story really boils down to two 
important questions, which Citron will answer, with the customary analysis and the 
smoking gun thrown in: 
 
Note:  This is not Herbalife, which we do not believe operates illegally in China.  And 
this is not Nuskin, which we still believe has abused the direct selling laws in China.   
 
USANA sells digestible products without any license permitting it to do so.  And does it 
so through a means by which their own customers have become their accomplices, as 
evidenced by arrests of USANA “associates”.  (Please see previous Citron article for 
links.)  Out of all of the publically traded MLM companies, it is USNA that is the most 
flagrant lawbreaker.  It has placed itself in the in the crosshairs of Chinese Government 
enforcement.

This report will answer the following 2 questions: 
 


#1: How important is China to USANA’s results?  
#2:  What is USANA doing to book revenues in China that is illegal, much 
less unsustainable? 
 


Is USANA’s revenue growth investable?   
Or is USANA a ticking time bomb? 


Citron presents the facts; you decide… 
 


Unlike Glaxo, for which China revenues are is just a tiny fraction of its worldwide 
revenues, “Greater China” represents more than 37% of USANA’s current revenues, and 
a disproportionate 46% of its global year-over-year revenue growth.  In fact, “Greater 
China” is topic #1 whenever USANA management discusses growth.    
 


Overview 
 
USANA, a well known multi-level marketing company, sells nutritional and food products via a network 
of independent “associates” in the US, a handful of European countries, and the Far East, 18 countries 
in all plus Columbia, just announced.  The company uses Hong Kong as an operations base from which 
it distributes product into Mainland China through thousands of Chinese nationals who live on the 
Mainland.  This induces them to violate numerous laws while operating a pyramid scheme.  As you will 
see below, not only does the company have to know about this, it is complicit.   
 
The company’s financial disclosures clearly demonstrate this illegal activity is playing an increasing role 


in USANA’s profit picture.  But Citron goes further, revealing the actual details of the 
recruitment and deployment of Mainland “associates”, who can only possibly be 
operating by violating three or possibly four entire categories of China’s laws:   
 


 Mainland China has strict licensing and labeling laws on for food supplements sold as 
digestibles for sale within China 


 China maintains import laws to strictly control importation of products not legally licensed for 
sale 


 China strictly prohibits all so-called multi-level marketing businesses under its laws against 
pyramid schemes 


 This scheme appears to be avoiding import duties and VAT tax collection 
 
Background:  Multi-Level Marketing vs Direct Selling
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 3 of 25 
 


Multi-level marketing, a business model strictly illegal in China, is one in which companies sell products 
by recruiting “independent” distributors (USANA deems them “associates”) who purportedly sell the 
company’s products direct to consumers.  But the compensation plans are designed so the “associates” 
make money primarily by recruiting new “associates” -- they make very little by selling the actual 
products.  Spinning dreams of unlimited wealth at lavish conventions (see link) one of which is being 
held in Hong Kong, the company induces many to enroll with “starter kits” of expensive products most 
will not ever sell.  Once enrolled, they are induced to keep buying, because they will lose their 
“associates” “commissions” if they do not.  Research shows that well over 99% of USANA-enrolled 
associates lose money and quit, while a very few people at the top of the pyramid make money. 
 
Typically, these businesses appear to be growing very fast while they are “new” to a region.  But as in 
all pyramid schemes, growth depends on ever-larger numbers of new people at the bottom; eventually 
the market saturates as people learn there is no “easy money”.  That has already happened to USANA 
and other multi-level marketing companies in the US and Europe.  So China is a huge attractive market, 
the biggest untapped growth market left for this scheme.  
 


However, while multi-level marketing and selling USANA nutritional products 
are legal in Hong Kong, these activities are strictly illegal in mainland China.  
 
Direct Selling License 
China allows direct sales people from USANA to operate under a “Direct Selling License”, which are 
strictly controlled.  USANA bought a small company, BabyCare (acquisition price $45 million cash plus 
about $16m in stock), and can legally hire direct sales people to sell BabyCare’s products from its retail 


store base.  But BabyCare is small, highly limited and geographically restricted market, licensed only in 
Beijing and three provinces.  It is a tiny piece of USANA’s business compared to its mainline food 
supplement product business.  And it cannot sell USANA nutritional products, its main source of 
revenues, at all within the Chinese mainland, and cannot sell at all using multi-level marketing.   
 
So how does this scheme work?  Read on.

  The Elephant in the Room Question:  What is really going on 
in “Greater China” ? 
Citron notes that USANA never voluntarily breaks out sub-region data in its filings.   
USANA’s defines its “Greater China” region as Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.  This is a classic 
model of “two ping pong balls and a bowling ball” – two tiny markets and the world’s largest, clumped 
together.  (Management has never broken out “BabyCare” product revenue, nor disclosed the number 
of “associates” operating in the Mainland.   Read excerpts of prior conference calls to observe them 
dance around these questions. ) 
 


“Greater China” by Population: 
 


 
 
However, it seems its auditors require it to disclose countries representing concentrations more than 
10% of revenue, so it gives us the following startling fact:  Hong Kong represents largest single sub-
region for USANA’s revenue, at 41.60m USD last quarter, surpassing even the United States, with 
40.24m USD in the most recent quarter.

Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 6 of 25 
 


This is an astonishing claim, considering that the Hong Kong is less than than 2.5% of the population of 
the United States.  So how is this possible that Hong Kong represents 24.6% of USANA’s entire revenue 
base?   Citron will now reveal exactly how it is being done.   
 
USANA’s sales network is operated via an MLM composed of 229,000 “associates” who are responsible 
for over 91% of the company’s sales.  These resellers explicitly do not include “Preferred Customers”, 
who are generally described as buying the products to consume personally, rather than sell them to 
others.  So let’s look at the geographic distribution of “associates”.  
 


Associates 
Active Associates 


Percentage 
distribution 


North America/Europe 78,000 34.06% 


Greater China 87,000 37.99% 


Southeast Asia 56,000 24.45% 


North Asia 8,000 3.49% 


 
229,000 100.00% 


 
So Greater China comprises USANA’s largest region for “associates”.  Citron notes the company has 
never disclosed its distribution of associates within the region.  Here’s where it gets interesting:  
“Greater China” includes only the following areas, so lets consider their populations and try to assess 
where the associates are:  
 


Population by Country within 
“Greater China” region 


Population 


Percentage 
distribution 


Estimated associates 
based on proportionate 
population compared to 
North America/Europe 


Taiwan 23,300,000 1.70% 2,930 


Hong Kong 7,200,000 .52% 905 


Mainland China 1,344,000,000 97.78% 83,165 ??? 


 
1,374,500,000   


 
Where in the world are all those associates?  
 
Even if we quintuple the estimate for distribution of “associates” in Hong Kong, and account for all the 
BabyCare division associates (estimated 17,000 with all the preferred customers converted), there 
would still be more than 60,000 associates (87K – 17K –  3K – 5K) who can only be operating in 
Mainland China.   
 


(Expressed another way, if the company’s disclosures are to be believed, 
there is one USANA distributor for every 83 people in Hong Kong!)    So with 
these numbers Citron hit the road and did some homework.  Read on.
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 7 of 25 
 


   So where in China are all those associates?  
The answer lies right on USANA’s own website.  Read on.  
 


What USANA Legally Can and Cannot Do in Mainland China 
In contrast to NuSkin, discussed previously in Citron, USANA has no legal authority to sell its mainline 
products in China.  Its nutritional supplements business, which comprises over 90% of its gross 
revenues, is not labeled or licensed for sale in mainland China.  And its primary method for distributing 
such products, which is multi-level-marketing, is strictly illegal in China.  In contrast to NuSkin, which is 
able to provide the appearance of legitimacy by its hiring sales associates who work out of retail 
locations, USANA has no such infrastructure.  It is only able to sell at all in the Chinese mainland 
through the purchase of its “BabyCare” subsidiary.  That business is small and offers an entirely 
different line of products.

New Findings Prove Illegal China operations are 
systemic -- and well known to, and abetted by, USANA 
management 
We simply looked on USANA’s website (before their IT folks caught 
on) and found all the bodies lying right there in plain sight. 
 
:   








Citron has obtained thousands of pages of “genealogy” reports of 
USANA’s own associates, reports which can be and are run by 
USANA upline distributors, listing the uplines and downlines of 
thousands of associates.  It is illegal for associates in China to 
have “uplines and downlines”…this is evidence of MLM activity.   
 
Check out the addresses of these “associates”, however….
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 9 of 25 
 


 
Finding #1:  Massive numbers of USANA “Associates” registered to the 
same address:   


Room 209 Wah Mei House 227 Ngau Tau Kok Road 
 


There are over 2,700 records with this address in the USANA “associates”’ database.  
Allowing that a distributor can list themselves as a downline, and removing duplicates, 
we think there are over 900 unique “associates” listed at this single address.  
 





A large Excel spreadsheet is attached showing all the details of the snapshot sample 
below.  [ Link to download ]

Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 10 of 25 
 





This notice above was posted on the wall next to room 209.  This notice was posted by the Kwan Tang 
Park division of the HK Housing Society on April 20, 2001. It says Mr. Zhou used to live here, but he has 
moved out. Our contact found a phone number on the notice, but the member of the Kwan Tang 
division of the Hong Kong Housing Society refused to tell him anything about Mr. Zhou. 
 
The two pictures of the door are from Room 209. Our contact knocked on the door many times, but no 
one answered. While on the 2


nd
 floor of the Wah Mei House our contact asked 2 women, who 


appeared to reside on the floor, if they knew who lived in Room 209, but the women told him that no 
one lived there. The women also had not heard of Jie Zhang, Jiafen Fang and Fang Zhang.  These are 
the names of three USANA “associates” who have the most downlines registered at this address.
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 11 of 25 
 





Finding #2:  Massive numbers of USANA Associates registered to the same 
address:   


Rm 1906 Kwong Yat House Kwong Tin Estate  
There are over 5,000 records with this address in the USANA “associates”’ database.  Again processing 


out duplicates and self-downlines, we think there are still over 2,000 unique associates 
listed to this address.

How do we know these can’t just be direct customers?   
For both these lists, nearly all entries have “volume needed” values.  Preferred customers don’t 
purchase starter kids or sign a business contract.  They aren’t issued a Business Center ID.  Preferred 
customers are not in a downline, and they are not able to collect commissions.  Some of these
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 13 of 25 
 


associates even have leadership rankings; many have multiple business centers.  They have distributor 
ID numbers and can be found on USANA distributor searches.   
 
Further searches at Kwong Tat House.  
We analyzed the phone numbers to see if any “associates” were using the same phone number.  Below 
are the 5 most common registered phone numbers for “associates” who live at “Rm 1906 Kwong Tat 
House Kwong Tin Estate” and the most senior ranking distributor who is registered with said phone 
number.

Is there something unique about these two apartment buildings? 
No. 
We found distributor records from at least 5 other Hong Kong addresses with hundreds of occurrences 
of the same address.  In this further overview of duplicate address records, we see, the following:

Most “associates” in these lists appear three times.  The reason is that “associates” who purchase 
USANA’s “Business Builder pack” earn the right to list themselves as their own first “left” and “right” 
downlines, creating a pseudo-benefit of climbing the pyramid faster.   We therefore estimate the 
actual number of distributors at these 5 addresses by dividing the total listings by three.   It’s certainly 
quaint to see attempts to create new addresses during registration entering a different room number, 
such as the New East Ocean Centre, where literally hundreds of rooms in the same building all 
coincidentally appear to house USANA “associates”.

[ Link to Thousands More Duplicate Addresses ]  


 
Did we have access to all the USANA “associates” data?  
No. 
We found a series of reports on the USANA website that had been previously run by USANA 
“associates” to report on their own downlines and uplines, or “Genealogy reports” as USANA calls 
them.   These reports would never have been applicable in a “direct sales” model.  They apply 
exclusively to Multi-Level Marketing schemes.  We think there are many many more “associates” 
with fake or blank Hong Kong addresses in the USANA database than the ones we found.

http://www.usana.com/dotCom/about/terms
Citron Research on USANA  July 23, 2013 Page 16 of 25 
 


Elsewhere we read that USANA purportedly has a policy of not allowing more than 15 “associates” to 
share the same address with manual override.  We understand they have had some “computer system 
problems” but this is too ridiculous to discuss.  


 
Extraordinary Research Measures 
 


Because of the extraordinary nature of these findings, researchers took a variety of extra measures to 
confirm this dataset.   


1)  We visited the Kwong Yat House – a public low-rent residential building on the outskirts of 
Hong Kong.  In room 1906 lives an old man who says he has lived there for many years, and has 
never heard of USANA. 
 


2) Site visit and dozens of phone interviews with “associates” whose listed address is Wah Mei 
House.  As might be expected, many deny ever having been a USANA distributor.  However, a 
surprising number answered questions with remarkable candor.  
 


3) Extensive study of over a thousand USANA groups on the popular Chinese social media site 
QQ.com  
 


Example: 
On May 27


th
, we spoke to Wenfa Zhang.  Wenfa is a USANA distributor who is listed as living at 


Room 209 Wah Mei House 227 Ngau Tau Kok Road (see photos above) and he said his wife 
introduced him to USANA.  We then checked our list of USANA “associates” to find out more about 
Wenfa and we found the following: 
 
·         According to Wenfa, he states he lives in Shenzhen (Mainland), and he signed up a total of 4 
downlines.  We found his downlines in our USANA distributor spreadsheet and found all of his 
downlines signed up in October, ’12, and they all are listed as living at Room 209 Wah Mei House 
227 Ngau Tau Kok Road.  
·         Our spreadsheet lists 9 of Wenfa’s uplines and the first 7 are listed as living at Room 209

Social Networks and the USANA sales pyramid 
 


One of the most popular chat and social networking sites in China is called QQ, owned by internet 
giant Tencent.  We found over 1,100 USANA groups in Mainland China on QQ that contain over 
19,000 members.  After we gathered this data, we selected 9 QQ Groups, that collectively had over 
1,000 members.  We listed every member and their email, and cross checked the 1,000 email 
addresses with our list of USANA “associates” who claim to live at the Wah Mei House.  There was 
no overlap. 





 
 
There are 2,538 QQ members in just these 8 USANA groups.  We paged through more than 20 pages 
of groups, all of which still had over 30 members.  
 


The 100 largest Mainland China USANA QQ Groups have 10,109 members 
The 250 largest Mainland China USANA QQ Groups have 14,524 members 
The 500 largest Mainland China USANA QQ Groups have 17,728 members 
 
Every USANA QQ Group has a creator.  Some of the Q group creators list their home towns and 
current location in their QQ profile.  The following information was extracted from the 100 
largest Mainland China USANA QQ groups:

USANA QQ Group Creator’s Home Town 


 90% - List their home town to be in Mainland China 
 01% - List their home town to be in Hong Kong 
 09% - Don’t list their home town in their QQ profile 
  
 USANA QQ Group Creator’s Current Location 
80% - List their current location to be in Mainland China 
03% - List their current location to be in Hong Kong 
11% - List their current location in a country besides China or Hong Kong 
06% - Don’t list their current location in their QQ profile 





One example: A specific QQ group:  [ LINK to the file Terry Wang.pdf ] 
o This group has 143 members – all of their names and QQ contact info is listed.  
o One group member is screen name “Terry”, and the profile indicates last name is 


“Wang” 
o Another group member screen name is “Linda”. 


USANA’s website lists Terry Wang as a member of the USANA Million Dollar Club and 
Top Global Income Earners 


o 96% of the QQ group members who list their current location claim to be living in 
Mainland China 
39% of group list their home town in their QQ profile, and 99% claim to have been born 
in Mainland

If USANA is selling millions of dollars of product in mainland China, what about the 


taxes?  
 
All USANA-branded products sold in Mainland China should be subject to import duties (20%) and VAT 
(17%).  (By contrast, Hong Kong has neither import duties, nor VAT.  The violation occurs when product 
is trans-shipped from Hong Kong to the Mainland.)  
 


·         55% of the “associates” we have spoken with believe no taxes are paid 
·         06% of the “associates” we have spoken with believe taxes are paid. 
·         39% of the “associates” we have spoken with were uncertain if taxes are paid. 


 
At the very least, this reflects a broad scale disregard for VAT and any other taxes paid on both sales 


and profits of USANA products in this scheme.

 Conclusion 
 


The above data from USANA’s own financial disclosures and website leave little doubt that the bulk of 
its 87,000 associates in “Greater China” live on the Mainland.  Most are induced to sign up for 
“Business Builder packs” (thus the triple entries in the USANA Genealogy reports, under the ruse that 
they live and sell in Hong Kong.  Those crazy over-the-top conventions don’t seem so innocent in light 
of the laws that people are encouraged to break in the name of “personal success”.  The numbers have 
already become ridiculous, and can only become more so.   
 
The harsh reality is that, while the company and its top-of-the-pyramid agents rake in millions, that 
profit is being earned by exploitation and exposing naïve people to terrible consequences.  The rank 
and file are all too easy to find, on the company’s own website, on QQ.com and via email.   There have 
already been individual arrests of USANA associates at the provincial level, as has been previously 
documented by Citron and elsewhere.   
 
Appx 35% of USANA’s sales and 45% of its growth are hanging on the slenderest of threads.  Referring 
back to Glaxo’s current challenges in China, any news that an attempt at serious enforcement of 
China’s anti-MLM, tax collection or product licensing labeling laws will be too late. 
 
And if by any conceivable chance, USANA has achieved this level of penetration of the Chinese market 
by spreading a few too-many gratuities, it could find itself afoul of US laws as well :  in particular the 
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   
 





ANSWER THAT ON YOUR CONFERENCE CALL… 
PS:  Lots of luck with that new ethics initiative!  
 
 


“Companies and individuals found guilty of economic crimes 
under Chinese law face serious financial penalties and the 
claw-back of unlawful gains. Prison sentences are not just 
reserved for the individuals involved – senior managers are 
also liable for fines and incarceration.”
