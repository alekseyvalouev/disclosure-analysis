HUSA RECENT RUN-UP IS A
“SNOW JOB”


Citron alerts readers about the identity of the
pseudo-analyst responsible for the pu�  piece
responsible for jacking HUSA, a mere shell of an oil
company, from 8 to 20 a share over the last month
or so.


He is none other than David G Snow, a name you
might not know if you’re a newbie to the stock
fraud beat.  But for you old-timers, grab your
Fedoras.


David G. Snow is none other than the
notorious analyst who pegged the $1000
price target on Solv-Ex, one of the most
notorious stock frauds of the 90’s … and
probably the largest energy stock fraud
ever … until Enron came along.


Houston American Energy Corp., (NASDAQ:HUSA)
took a stumble yesterday in response to skeptical
pieces published in Seeking Alpha this week.  (

The stock had enjoyed a remarkable 9-fold run-up
in the last nine months –on the shaky premise that
purchasing a minority “farm-in” of another
company’s drilling prospect in Colombia for $15
million justi�es an energy powerhouse worth more
than $500 million overnight.


The company’s CEO was quick to complain in an
after-hours PR yesterday about the “internet
postings” causing his stock to fall from 20 to
15…..we note no similar complaints from him as
wildly optimistic postings in February pushed the
stock from 8 to 20 in a few weeks.  Life is strange. 


So we presume he has no problem with David G.
Snow’s work on behalf of his company’s stock. 


Introducing… “That young sea-faring, bold and
daring, big bewhiskered, overbearing. Darling
Mister Snow” – Carousel


Here is Snow’s piece:

case-for-husa.html]


He calls it “Another Triton Energy”.  Citron suggests
Snow knows a lot more about Solv-Ex than Triton. 


He then goes on to discuss in minute detail all the
ins and outs of oil drilling prospects in Columbia as
though he just walked the oil-patch this morning. 
Seems impressive, leading the casual reader to
assume this guy must really know his resource
stocks.  Either he is a world-class expert on drilling
in Colombia, or he’s just cut and pasted the CEO’s
stream-of-hype into a story.  Seems like a guy we
should get to know!


So what do we actually know about “our darling Mr.
Snow”?


Oh no, not the SEC!!!

And it’s not just any stocks Mr. Snow was
recommending; he was the infamous shill whose

$1000 target shilled the notorious Solv-Ex, one of
the most notorious stock frauds of the 90’s … a
spectacular bust that cost investors $825 million.  
Nice call Mr. Snow.  We’d rate that one “another
Enron” …


As part of the above consent decree, his company
surrendered his company’s registration for
unlawfully recommending securities without
disclosing positions in the securities he was
recommending.  (In the case another worthless
penny-stock company, he had received shares for
free as a “�nders’ fee”. )

Mister Snow”

From Dec 11, 2007, ASLRF –we guess this isn’t
another Hecla … It was 43c at the time… and now its
9c.  Down 80%, during a time silver has risen 45% 
(Was $12 / oz, now $17.50 per ounce)


http://energy-equities.com/gold.htm [http://energy-
equities.com/gold.htm]  
From July 28, 2008  SRCH  — we guess this isn’t
another Newmont…It was 2.80 after his
recommendation, now $1.16.  That’s a loss of about
60% … during an interval in which gold has gained
about 25%.


Conclusion


Here we have a company whose principal asset was
bought for just $15 million; with just 3 employees,
and somehow that justi�es a market cap of $450
million….( with the CEO complaining that its down
from $600 million )  on the strength of a
recommendation coming from an advisor who lost
his license because he illegally recommended Solv-
Ex. 


 Cautious investing to all.
