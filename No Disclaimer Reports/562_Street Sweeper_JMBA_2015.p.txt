Jamba Juice: Potent Hype, Bitter Aftertaste
Feb. 9, 2015 6:32 PM ET4 comments
by: The Street Sweeper


Summary


Jamba has flown to a multi-year high on wild hopes for a celebrated – but widely
misunderstood – business strategy that actually seems like a rather unhealthy idea.


The company plans to sell more than 100 of its top-performing stores and then use
the proceeds to purchase its own stock – at a much steeper multiple of earnings.


Jamba stands to collect far less for those valuable assets than many bullish
investors mistakenly assume, too, while sacrificing a big chunk of revenue and
EBITDA in the process.


Meanwhile, Jamba has quietly racked up a mountain of buried expenses that make
the savings that it has trumpeted look incredibly overblown.


Jamba expects its future EBITDA to fall 30% below outdated Wall Street estimates
that analysts continue to maintain in spite of the much lower forecast presented by
the company itself.


By Melissa Davis, TheStreetSweeper Senior Editor


Maybe Jamba Juice (NASDAQ: JMBA) investors should have gulped down a bunch of
carrot-infused smoothies before they ever started drinking the company's Kool-Aid. With a
little sharper vision, they might have seen right through some of the more obvious hype
surrounding the company's new "asset-light" strategy and noticed at least a few of the
overlooked realities that make its celebrated plan seem like such an unhealthy idea.


Wait until they discover the bitter ingredients that Jamba has decided to include in its half-
baked recipe for success. Before they reward Jamba with any more applause for the steps
that it has taken to transform the company into a leaner - and ultimately more profitable -
smoothie chain, they better make sure that they can stomach the danger posed by the
bitter surprises listed below:


For starters, Jamba has effectively diluted the cost reductions that it has rushed to
celebrate by quietly recording a mountain of buried expenses that makes its reported
savings look wildly overblown.

Jamba has also chosen to later revise those overlooked expenses for no obvious
reason, taking liberties that make the company look as if it has literally engaged in
cooking its books.
In yet another move that seems to make little sense (unless the company simply
hopes to prop up its share price), Jamba has decided to sell more than 100 of its top-
performing stores and then use the proceeds to purchase its own stock - at a much
steeper multiple of earnings - instead.
By "refranchising" those valuable stores, Jamba actually stands to raise far less money
than wishful bulls like to think, while sacrificing most of the generous revenue and
EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) currently
generated by those busy locations.
Even with the possible (if not likely) benefit of one-time gains from asset sales, Jamba
expects its future EBITDA to fall 30% below outdated Wall Street estimates that
analysts continue to maintain in spite of the much lower forecast presented by the
company itself.
In a failed effort to boost customer traffic that has already led to a horrific quarterly
miss - and threatens to remain a lingering drag on its future results - Jamba has
introduced lower-margin products (such as fresh juices) that have simply cannibalized
smoothie sales and obliterated its profit margins instead.
Finally, Jamba has spent years relying on a CFO previously employed by a pair of
companies that seemed almost cursed with bad luck - one of them already bankrupt
and the other severely wounded - after they left her in charge of keeping track of their
own books.


Nevertheless, Jamba currently hovers within easy reach of a 20-month high that fails to
reflect most (if not all) of those largely overlooked risks. Jamba has gained so much
ground over the past couple of months, in fact, that its stock now trades 30% above the
price that it fetched right after the company reported a massive profit shortfall that
investors soon managed to somehow forgive and forget.


At its current price of $16.36 a share, Jamba arguably looks expensive by even generous
Wall Street standards. The stock has flown right past the price targets set by some of the
bullish analysts who actually recommend the highflying shares. Keep in mind that they
used overblown EBITDA projections to calculate those lofty targets, too.


So don't blame us if Jamba undergoes a sharp correction pretty soon. Investors deserve
to know the bitter truth. We just want to show them the difference between juicy hype and
cold reality.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 3/12


Jamba declined to answer questions for this story.


Diluted Savings: Reading between the "Other Operating, Net" Line


Hype: Jamba has clearly established that it can deliver the kind of savings necessary to
achieve its ambitious goal of driving its costs 20% below previous (2013) spending levels.
The company managed to reduce its expenses by $1.5 million during the first half of 2014
alone, paving the way for the firm to deliver much deeper cuts - totaling up to $2 million a
quarter - as the year drew to a close.


Reality: Barely half of the savings that Jamba reported last year actually dropped to the
bottom line. While Jamba likes to brag about its declining G&A (general and
administrative) expenses, the company never bothers to mention the soaring costs that it
has practically buried in its "other operating, net" line item - a handy catchall that also
includes convenient offsetting gains - when it discusses all of the money that it has
supposedly managed to save.


For some inexplicable reason, Jamba recorded a massive jump in "franchise expense"
during the first nine months of last year - up a whopping 145%, or $835,500, to $1.41
million - even though the company reported a fairly negligible 5% increase in franchise
locations over the course of that same time period.


If Jamba can somehow explain that gigantic disparity, it sure blew the perfect chance.
Blaming its silence on "quiet period" restrictions largely designed to prevent early leaks
about pending financial results, Jamba refused to answer questions about the soaring
(and, in some cases, conflicting) franchise expenses that the company has already
recorded in its books. Given the situation, we cannot help ourselves from wondering about
a rather obvious - albeit ominous - possibility: Maybe Jamba shifted expenses that it had
previously treated as normal overhead into a far less visible category instead.


By adjusting its G&A expenses to reflect those hidden costs, Jamba would see much of its
celebrated savings instantly disappear. Take a look at the helpful chart presented below,
featuring numbers extracted directly from the company's last three quarterly reports and
corresponding earnings releases, for a vivid illustration of the striking difference that
simple change would make.

Jamba has apparently decided that it can go back in time and save itself a lot of money on
those hidden expenses, too. A full year after the fact, Jamba slashed the franchise
expense that it had previously reported for one quarter in 2013 - literally cutting the
original number in half - with little more than a seemingly random stroke of the pen.


Let's just hope that management wasn't thinking about those widely overlooked expenses
as a source of G&A savings when it carried out the following exchange.


Analyst: "Within G&A, what are the areas where you see opportunity?"

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 5/12


CEO James White: "We expect to be able to update you in a couple of months here in
terms of the specifics. But we've got very significant pieces of work that have been
underway that you'll see us start to take action on over time as we move through the
strategy."


CFO Karen Luey: "Added to that … would be the reduction you currently have seen in
G&A on a year-to-date basis. We've been able to take $1.5 million out of our G&A in 2014
to the second quarter. So we're going to continue along those lines as well."


Asset Sales/Stock Buyback: Doing the Math to Expose a Lousy Trade


Hype: Jamba can maximize its future returns by selling its company-owned stores to
franchisees and then using the proceeds to invest more heavily in its publicly traded stock
instead.


Reality: If Jamba actually follows through with that misguided plan, the company will
essentially wind up selling its most valuable locations for a few times their annual EBITDA
and then paying roughly 18 times projected 2015 EBITDA for stock in a broader chain of
stores that mostly underperform the busy outlets that it just sold.


Jamba cannot reasonably expect to sell those 114 stores based upon their current
earnings power, either, since franchisees must cover all sorts of expenses (for royalty
fees, marketing costs, etc.) that will automatically slash the profitability of those locations
as soon as they change hands. Once Jamba makes allowances for those extra costs and
assigns a reasonable multiple to the leftover EBITDA that remains, the company will be
lucky to collect $20 million for all of those valuable assets - or less than one-third of the
generous estimates calculated by hopeful investors using inflated profits in their formula.


Feel free to double-check our math using the two handy charts presented below. We
relied on numbers presented in the company's own regulatory filings to arrive at those
eye-opening results.

Number of Stores 114


Total Revenue $85.5 Million

Four-Wall Margin (2013) 17.0%


Total Four-Wall EBITDA $14.5 Million


Multiple 4.5 x EBITDA


Total Proceeds $65.4 Million


Realistic Case (Based upon franchise-level store margins)


Total Revenue $85.5 Million


Base Four-Wall Margin 15.0%


Minus Royalty Fees - 5.0%


Minus Corporate Marketing Dues - 2.0%


Minus Local Marketing Costs - 1.5%


Minus Franchise G&A Expenses - 1.5%


Adjusted Four-Wall Margin 5.0%


Four-Wall EBITDA $4.28 Million


Multiple 4.5 x EBITDA


Total Proceeds $19.3 Million


Contrary to popular belief, Jamba will also remain on the hook for incremental costs
associated with those stores even after franchisees assume control of those locations,
too. While bulls like to think that Jamba enjoys 100% margins on franchise-based
revenue, the company itself has clearly indicated that it expects a whole lot less. Since the
midpoint of its future guidance anticipates a $5 million reduction in G&A and a mere $2

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 7/12


million boost in EBITDA, the company has basically implied that only 40% of the projected
savings that it hopes to realize by refranchising its stores will actually fall to the bottom
line.


If anything, however, Jamba seems more likely to weather a steep decline in its future
EBITDA instead. By refranchising those 114 California stores, its own financial results
indicate, Jamba will not only trade an estimated $85.5 million worth of revenue for roughly
$4.3 million in future royalty payments, but the company will also turn a valuable $14.5
million EBITDA stream into a meager $2.6 million contribution that's 80% below the level
that it should enjoy right now.


Talk about the exact opposite of a compelling business proposition. What on earth was
Jamba even thinking (or, better yet, drinking) when it decided to pursue such a regrettable
plan?


Never mind. As it turns out, Jamba happened to discuss its motivation at the first possible
chance, so we might as well let the company go ahead and speak for itself.


Analyst: "The California stores, are they kind of average California stores?"


CEO James White: "These are fantastic stores in California, but all the stores in California
largely are great performers for the company. The thought process is we're really moving
ourselves to be more of a franchise/asset-light model, so that's the basis for the move on
the refranchising initiative."


CFO Karen Luey: Plus, "as we execute upon our refranchising initiative, we expect to
evaluate increasing the amount of our (stock) repurchase program with additional cash
proceeds."


CEO James White: "We have significant liquidity and believe that this is both prudent use
of our capital and a way to reward shareholders who continue to believe in the story."


Weak Guidance: Confessing to Bulls Who Turn a Deaf Ear


Hype: Even after Jamba sells all of those valuable stores, the company can still generate
enough EBITDA to meet lofty Wall Street estimates. Jamba remains on track to deliver
almost $18 million worth of EBITDA this year, with that number soaring toward $24 million
the year after that.



https://seekingalpha.com/article/2640215-jambas-jmba-ceo-james-white-on-q3-2014-results-earnings-call-transcript
5/22/2018 Jamba Juice: Potent Hype, Bitter Aftertaste - Jamba, Inc. (NASDAQ:JMBA) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 8/12


Reality: Jamba recently issued new guidance that makes those targets seem like an
incredible stretch. Since Jamba expects to generate between $15 million and $17 million
worth of EBITDA this year, the company would fall short of Wall Street targets even if it
delivered results at the high end of that range. Jamba then hopes to modestly increase its
EBITDA to somewhere between $17 million and $19 million the following year, with the
midpoint of its range falling some 30% below current Wall Street estimates. Keep in mind
that Jamba may have very well included one-time gains that the company expects to
realize on asset sales in its projections, too.


After all, when Jamba hosted its most recent conference call, the company at least hinted
at that possibility whether it actually meant to show its hand or not.


Analyst: "Most of the 114 stores that you intend to refranchise are going to be in California,
which are your highest-margin stores … Refranchising those will help your percentage
margin. But at least incrementally, before there is an incremental build-out by new
franchises, won't that hurt your absolute profits?"


CFO Karen Luey: "Even if I strip out what I'm estimating for the overall gain for those
stores, our overall profitability goes up, (because) we've got 100 to 125 new store
locations that we're planning for 2015."


Menu Change: Opening the Door for Lasting Margin Pressure


Hype: Thanks to the widespread rollout of freshly squeezed juices and new energy bowls,
Jamba now features a much broader menu that will allow the company to supplement its
core smoothie sales by driving additional customers into its stores. While Jamba naturally
spent a lot of extra money to launch such a major growth initiative, the company can
expect its financial results to normalize now that it has moved past that temporary drag.


Reality: Following the company-wide introduction of those new products in the third
quarter of last year, Jamba actually weathered a decline in customer traffic and simply
wound up cannibalizing high-margin smoothie sales instead. Slammed by higher costs
and weaker margins that literally hammered its bottom line, Jamba reported horrible third-
quarter results that - with its profits falling 90% short of the consensus estimate - missed
Wall Street targets by a mile.


Although Jamba tried to blame that setback on temporary growing pains, the company
cannot expect its hammered margins to automatically recover from the heavy damage
caused by a permanent change to its menu. Just ask some of the bullish analysts who

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 9/12


promptly forgave Jamba for blindsiding them with its pathetic third-quarter results. Even
they felt dubious enough to at least question whether Jamba could fully rebound from that
lingering pressure any time soon.


For its part, Jamba never even saw that train wreck coming in the first place. After all,
when Jamba discussed the initial launch of its new juice initiative during its second-quarter
conference call, the company predicted a relatively smooth ride.


Analyst: "Operationally, how do you feel like the stores handled it? Do you feel like you've
worked out any bumps in the road in terms of whether it's customer service times or
spoilage cost with the fresh produce or any extra labor needed to support that product?"


CEO James White: "Yes. I think the deliberate pace with which we launched the platform
over time has allowed us to really refine the various executional elements of the program,
from waste to ordering to putting the fresh supply chain in place. (It's) early innings. We're
a couple of months into the platform being broadly expanded, but we're seeing good,
steady progress, and we're excited about how the organization is executing."


Analyst: "And in your comments, you said you thought (juice sales would be) 60% to 70%
incremental, which I'm interpreting as a new transaction as opposed to trading from a
smoothie to a juice sale. That seems higher than maybe what your commentary has been
in the past. Is that survey-based … somehow measuring a greater degree of
incrementality than what you've previously attributed?"


CEO James White: "As we continue to refine the set of our best practices and the more
we get outside of the four walls of our shops, from a marketing perspective, we're seeing
this juice platform in the consumer to be either a different consumer or a different occasion
or both."


Look how much that story changed by the time that the company updated the market just
a few months later.


CFO Karen Luey: "Our four-wall store performance was impacted by the top-line increase
of juice sales, which due to extensive trial and awareness-driving tactics, cannibalized
smoothie sales … We took advantage of the high consumer demand and significantly
accelerated the rollout of both juice and Energy Bowl platforms, and as a result, Q3
reflects increased labor and cost of goods sold. Labor increased 250 basis points due to
the juice and Energy Bowl product platforms, which required additional labor for
production, training and marketing initiatives and managing customer throughput and
service times."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2900276-jamba-juice-potent-hype-bitter-aftertaste 10/12


CEO James White: "We've taken two of the more complicated products that we've
launched in the company's history - albeit two of the more attractive propositions from a
consumer perspective - and they've disrupted the production flow. We're in the process
today of reengineering the flow … so we can get back to a more normalized speed of
service."


Analyst: "The shift to a juice emphasis or a juice blend works very well if you get
incremental traffic since it's a lower-margin product … But looking at a year ago, it was an
extremely weak quarter in terms of four-wall sales, and it doesn't look like you're
generating any incremental traffic … Assuming everything else is equal - which it always
is - for each incremental unit of juice versus smoothie that you sell, what kind of a traffic
offset do you need? In other words, if your juice goes from 7% to 10% of sales, let's say,
what kind of a traffic builder do you need assuming no price increase to offset that?"


CEO James White: "I don't know that I have the answer to that question, but we'll work on
that for the next call … To put a sharper point on some of the in-store activities that we've
stopped, we were sampling even in stores that we had rolled juice out in a year ago. That
was an error. We moved away from those activities, and now we're seeing most of our
activities be out of store, making sure that the juice sales that we garner are more
incremental … In some cases, our franchise partners have been a little bit smarter than
we have been. So some of the in-store things that we would have executed on juice, they
didn't, which was an advantage … We're learning from some of that experience."

the company has booked - CFO Karen Luey spent most of her career serving as the
