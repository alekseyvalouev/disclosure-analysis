FOIA Reveals Generic Alternatives For
Acthar Likely To Have Very Similar Labels,
Medicare Part D Exposure Remains A Risk

Summary
The most pertinent risk is ANI Pharma (ANIP) and the corticotropin they bought
from Merck.


A FOIA of the historical label that Organon had approved in 1955 shows that it was
granted a similar label for adult indications.


Renegotiating the debt is now critical as the ANIP risk is near term and the
exclusivity period for the Cadence products is looming.


Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals (NYSE:MNK) sells H.P. Acthar Gel a product that was first
approved well before the FDA began the process of requiring rigorous clinical trials
before granting product approvals. The product now sells for ~$44k/vial (after the
roughly 7% price hike in the first Q) which represents roughly a 110,000% increase in
price since the product was acquired by their subsidiary Questcor in 2001. If that figure
looks odd to you it's because 1,100x increase in price is a hard number to express in
percentage points without a double take.

Sadly these facts are not new - the basics were covered by Andrew Pollack of the NY
Times years ago. The price has continued to rise and the company has refused to
disclose how much the American taxpayer is forking over via government sponsored
healthcare plans such as Medicaid or Medicare Part D.


Queue Andy Slavit - what a guy - as CMS administrator Andy decided to publish a
"Medicare Dashboard" that shows a whopping $500m in Part D exposure and an
additional $160m in Medicaid exposure for 2015 alone for H.P. Acthar Gel.


WHEN WILL THE TAXPAYER STOP BEING FLECED?


Thankfully the light is at the end of the tunnel on this one. Thorough the FOIA process
we were able to obtain the original label for the product that ANI Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(ANIP) bought from Merck (MRK) and is working on modernizing at the moment.


The historical label for the product includes:


Dermatologic disorders (atopic dermatitis, psoriasis)1.


Rheumatoid arthritis2.


Acute lupus erythematosus3.


Bronchial asthma4.


Pulmonary emphysema5.


We have attached the PDF for your convenience below.


BUT IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THIS PRODUCT THROUGH THE FDA


ANIP doesn't seem to think so - nor do its employees. In the past few months ANIP has
hired:


Mark Ginski Ph.D. - Former Senior Director of CMC at MNK1.


Karen Quinn - Former Sr. Director of Global Regulatory Affairs - CMC at Takeda
Pharmaceuticals

These hires are particularly important because - in our judgment - the most significant
hurdle for filing the sNDA is proving to the FDA that your CMC process is robust and
repeatable enough to show that you consistently produce the original substance.
Because there is no source material to compare to here, FDA has the ability to be as
helpful or as difficult as it chooses to be. Having experienced hands presenting the CMC
package is critical as - in our judgment - the FDA will be incentivized to relieve the
upward pressure that price gouging generic products like H.P. Acthar Gel are placing on
the system.


By the way - the review period for an accepted sNDA is only 6 months - so once the
press release hits that it has been filed one has very little time to react.


BUT CANACCORD SAYS THE MEDICARE DASHBOARD IS MISUNDERSTOOD


Dewey Steadman of Canaccord launched on MNK with a whopping $91 dollar price
target last night. Featured prominently in his report is the assertion that the outrage
surrounding the Medicare dashboard was the result of being uninformed.


There are two significant issues with this assertion:


In November of 2016 at the Jefferies Conference in London Cole Lannum stated "...if
you take a look at our core exposure of Acthar for Medicare, it's somewhere in the
mid-40s percent range. If you take it to Medicaid, it's probably in the mid-single digit
range. "

This OIG report concludes that Part D only receives discounts of about 15%2.

Grab the growth, tame the risk
Facebook and Amazon were part of a $4 trillion+ mobile economy that may be past
its peak. 


The next major boom? AI and Machine Learning are predicted to be 4x larger than
the mobile economy, and these new Tech Kings are leading the way… 


Banks, media, healthcare, tech and other industries are spending billions on AI and
ML. Facebook alone will spend at least $10 billion this year in its pursuit of the
metaverse. Beth Kindig is a Silicon Valley insider with her finger on the pulse of the
companies that stand to benefit most from this huge increase in capital expenditure.

So if the argument is that the company only receives 50% of its H.P. Acthar revenue
from the federal government - as opposed to the 65% that was initially suggested by the
numbers that CMS put forward - we cry uncle. You win. The company is only fleecing
the taxpayer for $500m per year.


CONCLUSIONS


With all of this risk surrounding its lead product H.P. Acthar Gel it's not a surprise that
MNK is trying to renegotiate its debt and extend the maturity dates - its the smart thing
to do. It's just going to be surprising if the debt market supports such a transaction given
the inherent risks associated with this company.
