Uni-Pixel: Is The SEC Investigating?
Jun. 21, 2013 10:52 AM ET244 comments
by: Alpha Exposure


When we consulted with experts in the touch screen industry who had tested UniBoss, it
was clear to us that Uni-Pixel (NASDAQ:UNXL) was unlikely to be successful. You can
find a summary of our findings in our first article. But the best shorts don't just have bad
technology - they also have bad characters. So as we did our checks, we also researched
the past histories of the management team. The information we uncovered was
overwhelmingly negative.


Three current and former Uni-Pixel executives have been involved in past scandals at
their companies where there have been allegations of fraud. In the lawsuits described
below, the similarities are striking. The lawsuits claim that executives raised money from
investors despite knowing that their technologies and products did not work and were
going to fail. We believe that Uni-Pixel executives are at it again, but this time we suspect
the SEC is catching up to them.


SEC letters and FOIA response


We have witnessed what we and others believe to be multiple examples of securities
violations by the executives at Uni-Pixel. As a result, we wrote the SEC on three separate
occasions about our concerns regarding Uni-Pixel's behavior. On April 22, 2013, the SEC
received a letter highlighting three material violations of its disclosure obligations
concerning the material terms of Uni-Pixel's "manufacturing and supply" agreement with
Eastman Kodak Company (click here). On May 2, 2013, the SEC received a letter
detailing further evidence that Uni-Pixel had violated securities laws by withholding
information regarding the terms of the Kodak agreement prior to its sale of shares on April
18, 2013 (click here). Lastly, on May 21, 2013, the SEC received a letter highlighting
probable Regulation FD violations by Uni-Pixel with regard to selective disclosures (click
here).


Some investors dismiss investor complaints to the SEC based on an outdated and jaded
view that the SEC only acts after a fraud is revealed, so we decided to try to determine
whether the SEC was taking the allegations of securities violations seriously. To check
this, we filed a request with the SEC under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to see
the correspondences they have had with Uni-Pixel since the start of the year. This is what
they said in their response to our FOIA request (full SEC letter here):

"After consulting with SEC staff, we have determined to withhold non-public records that
may be responsive to your request, under 5 U.S.C. ยง 552(b)(7)(NYSE:A), 17 CFR ยง
200.80(b) (7)(NYSE:I). This exemption protects from disclosure records compiled for law
enforcement purposes, the release of which could reasonably be expected to interfere
with enforcement activities."


While we are not securities lawyers, our opinion after reading the letter from the SEC is
that Uni-Pixel is probably under investigation by the SEC. While the language in the
response letter does not say an SEC investigation is certain, it is highly suggestive. The
fact that Uni-Pixel did not disclose any language in their most recent 10-Q and 10-K filings
regarding any open SEC investigations or inquiries indicates to us that this is probably a
new investigation by the SEC. If this is true, it is most likely very bad news for both Uni-
Pixel and its investors. We have confidence that the SEC will not sit idly by and let this
apparent stock promotion spiral out of control and risk leaving egg on the SEC's face after
it received numerous warnings about these bad actors. We think Bernie Madoff was
enough bad press for the SEC. In our opinion, the gig is almost up.


History of fooling investors with dubious technologies


That Uni-Pixel may be under investigation by the SEC should not be a surprise to anyone
who has conducted even a cursory review into the backgrounds of the executives. We
know others have touched upon this, but we think that it is worth going into just how
untrustworthy we believe the management team is. Long investors point to the executives
and say they're credible people. However, a series of simple internet searches reveals that
it's a list of characters that have been involved in multiple scams and have connections to
other scam artists.


CTO Robert Petcavich is front and center on Uni-Pixel, and everything we know about him
suggests he has a history of parting otherwise trusting investors from their money. His
biography is filled with development stage companies in emerging industries that never
panned out despite raising millions from investors. Over the course of his career, he's
worked on biodegradable plastics, implantable RFID chips, animal neutraceuticals, fruit
shelf life extension technology, and even biotech.


The pitch at every one of his companies is the same. Bob Petcavich promotes a
breakthrough technology that he invented at a fraction of the cost of existing technologies.
It's so great that he's willing to let you in on it if you just invest a few million dollars.

The following Los Angeles Times article from September 29, 1992 is a great example
(click here). The article states, "Petcavich now acknowledges that the demonstration was
more of a circus sideshow than proof that his proprietary technology represented a viable
way to reduce waste. But the sideshow/press conference drew the desired attention from
potential investors and customers."


Despite the show, Bob Petcavich was able to raise $2.4 million from 50 private investors.
From 1992 to 2002, Bob Petcavich ran Planet Polymer Technologies, the company
referred to in the Los Angeles Times article. Under his leadership, the company
continually switched product ideas, ranging from recycling and packing products to fruit
coatings. Petcavich and Planet Polymer Technologies were even sued by a director and
fundraiser. In that lawsuit, the director accused Petcavich of having knowledge that a
technology would not work while at the same time pitching it to investors. The former
director also alleged that Bob Petcavich tried to buy his silence with shares in another
company Petcavich founded named A-Life Medical.


Want more? We think his latest venture is especially curious. Start at the 11:00 mark of the
video (click here).


It's important to note this was filmed in August 2011. The date was confirmed to us by the
producer. This overlaps with Bob's tenure at Uni-Pixel. While Bob was busy revolutionizing
the touch panel industry at Uni-Pixel, Bob tinkered in his kitchen and developed a
miraculous way of extracting oil sands for "one fourth to one eighth the cost of existing
extraction technologies" (12:50 mark) in only 15 seconds.


If you've been duped into thinking Uni-Pixel is a great investment, you should seriously
consider his oil sands venture. Those who are interested may be in luck, because in the
video he mentions he's looking for $2 million in funding.


If you think this is a one off, let us point you to a presentation from 2009 from a conference
titled "Energy and Clean Technology Elevator Pitches." (Click here for the link) Once
you're on the website, click on the presentation on AquaOil from Bob Petcavich to listen to
the 90 second audio file, or click here for the mp3. Again, this was while Bob was working
at Uni-Pixel. Again, Bob has developed a breakthrough technology in a fast growing field.
This time, he claims he can grow gasoline in aquatic plants. It seems like Bob Petcavich
has become quite an expert in oil while he led Uni-Pixel's UniBoss initiative.


Oh, and as indicated in the clip, Bob just needs $3 million to develop this renewable,
biofuel, aquatic gasoline technology.

Bob Petcavich isn't the only Uni-Pixel executive with a checkered past. CFO Jeff Tomz
was previously CFO of Isolagen, an aesthetic procedure company that ultimately
collapsed in a tangled web of lies, failure, and stock fraud. Isolagen had a wrinkle-
reducing product that never really worked despite enormous promises. In a class action
lawsuit filed against Jeff Tomz and other Isolagen executives, shareholders alleged that
the company misrepresented the efficacy of its product and probability of success. The
lawsuit said that even though Isolagen knew its product would not gain regulatory
approval in the US and was failing commercially in the UK, Isolagen executives withheld
this information from the market and issued stock and bonds to shareholders.


Meanwhile, executives cashed out of millions of dollars' worth of stock through secondary
issuances and privately negotiated transactions. In June 2004, after a significant increase
in share price, Isolagen raised $61 million of gross proceeds. As part of the greenshoe,
insiders sold $7 million worth of stock. Then in November 2004, Isolagen issued a $90
million convertible note and used $26 million of the proceeds to purchase shares from
insiders and other unnamed parties at privately negotiated prices. All in all, Isolagen
raised $151 million from the public markets while insiders dumped $17 million of stock at
the same exact time.


Soon after the capital raises, Isolagen announced its aesthetic product failed, and it later
revealed that Isolagen had made little progress on its highly touted ACE System, even
though it had repeatedly and publicly promised that it was in the "final stages" of
development.


In September 2006, shareholders filed a class action lawsuit against Jeff Tomz and other
executives. Isolagen ultimately settled the class action lawsuit in 2008 and soon thereafter
filed for bankruptcy. Here's a link to the lawsuit and settlement:


Isolagen Class Action Lawsuit


Isolagen Settlement Notice


Of the $151 million raised, investors recovered only $4.4 million. That's less than a 3%
recovery.


While the settlement was paltry, it wasn't because the shareholders' case had no merit.
We spoke to the lead lawyer in the case at Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman LLP. He
said Isolagen essentially had no assets remaining and all that was left was D&O
insurance. They settled because the D&O policy was the company's last remaining asset
of any value.

You can read the lawsuit and claim Jeff Tomz was just a bit player in this. After all, he
wasn't a founding member of Isolagen and only sold $208,989 worth of stock. You can try
to argue that he wasn't one of the bad apples. However, before be joined Isolagen in
2001, Tomz was a Principal at Benchmark Equity Capital from 1999-2001. Isolagen's
largest shareholder was Frank DeLape. Frank was part of a group that gained control of
Isolagen in 2001 and during the period of the class action lawsuit, he personally sold $5
million of stock and was one of the insiders who sold shares to Isolagen using proceeds
from the $90 million convertible. Frank DeLape is founder, CEO, and Chairman of
Benchmark. He clearly had a prior relationship to Jeff and likely brought him to Isolagen.


It is also important to note that Frank DeLape is co-founder, ex-CEO, and ex-Chairman of
the Board of Uni-Pixel. In fact, he hired Jeff Tomz in 2004 and brought Tomz into Uni-Pixel
after Tomz left Isolagen. Frank DeLape also hired Reed Killion.


What do we know about Reed Killion? A review into Uni-Pixel's history shows that during
his tenure as CEO of Uni-Pixel, Reed has been responsible for numerous failures and
zero successful product launches. Others have pointed this out, but it's worth repeating.
As CEO, he is responsible for Uni-Pixel's failed TMOS, Opcuity, and Diamond Guard
products. Each product came with big promises of commercialization, yet resulted in no
significant revenues. None of these products were ever even introduced into the
marketplace. He is also responsible for missing numerous financial forecasts. The worst
example is when Reed guided to $6 million in Diamond Guard revenues in 2011, slashed
that target mid-way through the year, and ultimately delivered less than $200,000 in total
revenues. Lastly, Reed has signed and touted numerous agreements, partnerships, and
development deals with companies like Samsung, Avery Dennison, and Texas
Instruments. However, none of these agreements have produced any commercial
products.


Would you want to be an investor in a company associated with Frank DeLape, Jeff Tomz,
Bob Petcavich, and Reed Killion?


Amazingly, it doesn't stop there. The story behind Uni-Pixel's executives gets even better.
The current Chairman of Uni-Pixel is Bernard Marren. He has been a CEO or Director at
four companies (Opti Inc., Western Micro Technologies, Infocus, and Mondowave) that all
experienced significant declines in their stock prices and are now either bankrupt,
liquidating, or worthless penny stocks. If history is any indication, should investors trust his
leadership at Uni-Pixel?

As if this isn't bad enough, there is also the bizarre. A Barron's article on Uni-Pixel from
May 11, 2013 highlighted the unusual beliefs of Martin Selbrede. The article can be found
here. Martin is the former chief scientist at Uni-Pixel and inventor of TMOS, which was the
first technology that Uni-Pixel tried to commercialize. The Barron's reporter wrote that
Martin Selbrede has been associated with geocentrism, which is the belief that the Sun
revolves around the Earth. We dug a little further into Martin's background and discovered
that he has no college level degree. Is it any wonder that TMOS failed?


This begs the question, "What type of person would hire these people?" The CEO hired
these people when even a simple internet search reveals their checkered pasts. We're
shocked by the lack of judgment in hiring the executives at Uni-Pixel. If you were a CEO of
a company, would you hire a CTO who has never successfully developed and
commercialized a product? Would you hire a CFO who was the subject of a class action
lawsuit by investors and resulted in a multimillion dollar settlement?


This makes us ask, "Were these people hired despite their past, or were they hired
because of their past and ability to dupe investors?" More importantly, would you as a
shareholder put your money in his hands?


Uni-Pixel is a short at any price


We believe that this article provides compelling proof that Uni-Pixel is run by an
untrustworthy management team and our prior article shows that the technology doesn't
work. In a few weeks, we intend to expose the company's dodgy accounting and after that
we don't think you will trust their financials any longer either.


Uni-Pixel supporters always point to the agreements with a major PC maker (supposedly
Dell Inc. (DELL)), Ecosystem Partner (supposedly Intel (NASDAQ:INTC)), and Eastman
Kodak as proof that Uni-Pixel is real this time. Uni-Pixel's supporters argue that these
rumored partners would not have signed agreements and given Uni-Pixel millions of
dollars unless the products worked. We find this logic to be faulty and extremely
dangerous. If these executives from Uni-Pixel can repeatedly fool sophisticated investors
out of millions of dollars with their lies and promises, why can't they pull the wool over the
eyes of executives at technology companies? What makes them so different? We've
caught on that it isn't different this time, and soon enough we expect that the SEC will
catch on as well and properly put an end to this nonsense.


In our previous write up, we put out a fair value target of $3. We now think that's too
generous and would be short Uni-Pixel at any price. This company has never generated
substantial sales from its products. The only meaningful revenues we have been able to
