Summary


Short Ideas Healthcare


Ocata’s RPE stem cell therapy trials are dubious at best and research indicates are
highly likely to cause tumors.


Ocata has a long history of ties to people accused of a range of securities violations
and fraud.


The company has accomplished little or nothing in over a decade as a public
company except huge dilution and shareholder losses.


Throughout its life, Ocata has pursued desperate financings to keep the company
afloat as insiders get rich.


Ocata has ties to numerous stock promoters and other bad actors in what is clearly
an “ecosystem” of shareholder value destruction.

I believe shares of Ocata (NASDAQ:OCAT) are worth nothing and provide extensive
detail throughout this report to support that claim. Ocata Therapeutics is Advanced Cell
Technology reborn under a new name. Advanced Cell has a long history of bad behavior
as a public company and should have gone bankrupt long ago. This report details a
shocking and pervasive history at Advanced Cell/Ocata of insider enrichment, failure,
dubious financing activities, stock promotions, and unviable science. Longs have based
their investment case on what they perceive to be the scientific potential of Ocata's stem
cell pipeline, which is shown throughout this report to be unviable.


In my view, Ocata appears as nothing more than an enrichment vehicle for insiders and
I recommend all investors avoid this stock and/or pursue short positions. Despite its
clear lack of value, OCAT shares trade with only a 3.6% short interest with plentiful
borrow and a low rebate of roughly -7% annually. I believe any investor looking for a low
cost hedge to otherwise viable biotech stocks such as the iShares Nasdaq
Biotechnology ETF (IBB), Amgen (AMGN), Gilead (GILD), Biogen (BIIB), etc. should
consider shorting OCAT since OCAT shares are essentially worthless. I am not
recommending any of these stocks as investments, but it is well known that a strategy of
long quality and short garbage has performed well in the stock market over time.


Ocata's "Science": An Unviable Pipedream with Flawed Clinical Trials and
Significant Tumor Risk


Cowen, who has served as Ocata's investment banker within the last 12 months and is
obviously conflicted, issued a glowing Outperform report on Ocata shares on July 10th,
2015. The stock has declined nearly 40% since Cowen initiated coverage at $5.01. The
analyst who wrote the report is Boris Peaker, who has what I consider one of the worst
track records I've ever seen on the sell side. The report issued what I view as a
hopelessly optimistic outlook of Ocata's prospects, and below I will debunk this report
part by part to show what I believe is the reality of Ocata the sell side cheerleader
bankers will never tell you.


Here is a summary of the key points I am about to expose:


Ocata has conducted initial RPE trials with no control group and inconclusive results
that should be heavily discounted. Ocata's clinical trial design and inconclusive
results render the scientific "progress" at Ocata highly questionable.

Based on numerous other independent studies, there is significant ongoing concern
about safety in stem cell treatments.


2.


Based on a FDA/CBER review, the FDA and other regulatory agencies always
consider ALL cell-based RM products as tumorigenic.


3.


According to the FDA, tumor occurrence is generally a slower process that can
take years to develop. Ocata has only monitored patients for 12 months after
the stem cell treatment, which is clearly insufficient and raises serious
questions about data integrity and intent.


4.


Even if you ignore all of these issues, Ocata faces an onslaught of competition from
larger, well-capitalized companies that lack the massive losses, ongoing
disappointment, and painful financing arrangements present at Ocata/Advanced Cell.

Cowen's Analyst, Boris Peaker: Rx'ing negative alpha to investors' portfolios6.


OCAT is a zombie stock, pairs trade opportunity7.


Ocata has conducted initial RPE trials with no control group and inconclusive
results that should be heavily discounted


Cowen would have you believe that Ocata offers promising new stem cell treatments
based on Retinal Pigment Epithelial (RPE) for the treatment of Stargardt's Macular
Degeneration (SMD) and Age-related Macular Degeneration (AMD), two eye diseases.
Cowen's report focuses on ridiculously high out year estimates of revenue potential
while missing the most important aspect of Ocata: The clinical trial design is unviable,
initial results are inconclusive, and significant safety concerns exist and will remain as
an overhang on the stock for years to come while OCAT insiders never seem to miss a
paycheck. In fact, based on the glaring omissions in the Cowen report, the best course
of advice seems to be to ignore Cowen completely. Let's take a closer look.



https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stargardt_disease

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macular_degeneration
Ocata, under the guidance of Robert Lanza, has published a study in Stem Cell Reports
in which they claimed that human Embryonic Stem Cell derived Retinal Pigment
Epithelium (hESC-derived RPE) treatment was found beneficial in 4 Asian patients
including 2 dry age-related macular degeneration patients and 2 Stargardt macular
degeneration (SMD) patients. The results were in line with the previously published
study (by Ocata/ACT) in Lancet. Contrary to these studies, the FDA and scientific
community have significant reservations about the long-term safety of stem cell
treatments. I discuss the lack of convincing safety data in the next section of this report.


This is not a typo: There were only 4 patients in the study. That is simply not a viable
sample size to draw any conclusions about efficacy or safety. Furthermore, there was no
control group. This study, in other words, means basically nothing. Yet it remains the
primary (false) justification for a nine-figure market cap for OCAT, something the market
has been correcting recently.


As reported in the study, after treatment, the clarity of vision (visual acuity) was claimed
to improve in both groups by a number of letters. At 52 weeks, improvements in reading
letters by one and nine letters in two dry AMD patients were observed, respectively. In
SMD patients, improved vision by 12 and 19 letters, respectively, was reported in treated
eyes. Shockingly, nine letters improvement was also reported in untreated eyes
and perhaps sheds some light on why a useful control group was not included in
any fashion.


In fact, quoting directly from the study: "The sample size in these studies (SMD phase I:
3 patients; dry AMD phase I/IIa: total of 12 patients, with 3 for each dose) was not
powered to detect an improvement in visual acuity." Yet, investors have placed false
hope on this poorly designed study with results showing that even untreated eyes
improved.


If untreated eyes showed improvement, how do we even know if the stem cell treatment
works at all? After all, there was no control group in the study.


If untreated eyes showed improvement, why risk stem cell treatments that could lead to
tumors in your eyes?

http://www.cell.com/stem-cell-reports/fulltext/S2213-6711%2815%2900105-8
In other words, meaningful improvement was shown in both treated and untreated
eyes, which clearly shows that the trial was inconclusive at best, and completely
without value at worst. Why is Cowen not talking about this? Obviously, it does
not fit the capital raising agenda: Based on CapIQ data, it is clear that Cowen
earned ~$725,000 in fees as the most recent investment banker for Ocata. No
wonder they didn't mention the seemingly meaningless trial results, that is a lot of
fees!


What we should note is, in both the SMD and AMD patient studies, NO control or
comparator group was included. The improvement in the untreated eyes has raised
several questions about the treatment's real efficacy and possibility of placebo effects.


The bottom line is the study is a joke, and at best is inconclusive with no reason to
believe the FDA would ever consider this a viable study leading to RPE stem cell
treatment approval. In fact, given the significant questions around safety and efficacy,
the FDA will require extensive testing prior to the approval of any stem cell treatment,
from Ocata or not, something the FDA has made abundantly clear. There is simply
nothing of substance to discuss about the Ocata "trial" that in reality was not even a real
trial and contains numerous safety red flags!


Based on numerous other studies, there is significant ongoing concern about
safety in stem cell treatments


The reason Ocata did not have a control group is these studies were meant to measure
safety, but they failed in this regard as well because the study did not follow up for a
sufficient period of time to prove the long-term safety in treated patients. Recently, Ocata
has initiated 2 long term, observational studies on AMD and SMD patients. Stem cell
therapy has serious potential side effects including tumor formation (tumorigenesis),
which is considered a risky complication. The risk of tumor formation depends on the
nature of the stem cell type (fetal nerve cell, muscle cells, embryonic stem cells),
multiplying ability, cell dose, ability to survive, etc. - it is complex, difficult to study, and
these tumors can take years to develop.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3070641/
After reviewing the literature, my view is that there has been no convincing long-term
safety profile demonstrated by Ocata or anyone else. This is particularly surprising
considering OCAT originally went public way back in 2005 as Advanced Cell
Technology. What is especially relevant for all investors who wish to avoid losing money
is that Ocata has followed-up the RPE cells-transplanted patients for just one year.
However, development of tumors in humans after stem cell treatment can take several
months to years depending of various factors. Hence, the follow-up of just one year is a
clinically inept approach to monitor the safety or the incidence of tumor development. It
will most likely take years before Ocata can even prove a basic safety profile (I believe
this treatment will never prove safe), and in the meantime, all investors have to look
forward to is even more dilution in OCAT shares.


Ocata's opinion of the safety based on very short-term data is largely irrelevant in the
scientific community. If we look into the scientific reality, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) considers ALL stem cell-based treatments/products are potentially
carrying the risk of tumor formation. According to the FDA, tumor development takes
several months to years, and occurrence of tumorigenicity is difficult to test.


If we look into the available scientific evidence, it's clear that ongoing concerns remain -
there is a lack of procedural and approval process standards in stem cell research that
can create huge translational potholes (from animal studies to humans) in clinical
applicability, treatment efficacy, and patient safety. Even in animal studies,
transplantation of hESCs leads to tumor formation (teratoma) in hESC-transplanted
mice. The clinical applicability of stem cell products is limited due to tumor formation.


Several researchers including Dr. Jeanne Loring, a researcher at the Scripps Research
Institute at La Jolla and Dr. Magdalene Seiler, a project scientist at the University of
California, Irvine, who were not associated with Ocata and/or the study, have pointed
out that "it is too early to draw conclusions based on the small study and long-term
problems of stem cell therapy for AMD and SMD should be assessed."


In fact, Loring said, "I think it's still anecdotal that some people seem to improve."


Ocata appears biased for obvious reasons.

http://www.the-scientist.com/%3farticles.view/articleNo/42863/title/Eye-Stem-Cell-Therapy-Moves-Ahead/
Adding credibility to these experts' concerns, a study published by the National Institute
of Health (NIH) has reported the risk of developing tumors (tumorigenesis) after human
embryonic stem cell (hESC) transplantation. The title of the paper was, "Tumorigenicity
as a Clinical Hurdle for Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies." I'm going to go with the NIH on
this one since they are both unbiased, and in my view, possess superior clinical and
regenerative medicine expertise to Ocata.


The key sentence in the paper is, "[T]he intrinsic qualities of self-renewal and
pluripotency that make these cells so therapeutically promising are also responsible for
an equally fundamental tumorigenic potential." This is the problem that no one, including
Ocata, has been able to solve yet. Don't waste your hard-earned investment dollars
chasing a long shot from a company with numerous other problems, as detailed
throughout this report.


According to the same study, the reported risk was present in human and animal
studies. Some of the main safety concerns associated with hESC use are risks of
genetic abnormalities, immune rejection, challenges in development of good
differentiation and selection protocols, tumor formation (non-cancerous) and risk of
developing cancer and infections. Stem cells, including transplanted stem cells can
multiply rapidly and potentially contribute to tumor formation. If we inject these cells into
the affected eye (retina) of AMD or SMD patients, tumor development in these sensitive
areas can pose serious problems.


Echoing the FDA's concerns, a recent study has reported the development of pluripotent
stem cell-derived tumors in patients who received stem cell transplantation for the
treatment of ataxia telengiactasia (genetic disorder) and lupus nephritis (immune
disorder), which took several years to develop. These findings raise several questions
about the long-term safety of stem cell therapy. This is further reason to discount
Ocata's 12-month study as "safe" - 12 months is simply not enough time to draw any
conclusions.

http://jasn.asnjournals.org/content/21/7/1070.long
Testing and monitoring the tumor formation in animal studies involves several controlled
laboratory studies called in vivo and in vitro studies. These tests can identify the
changes in genetic level and the rate of multiplication of implanted cells. Nevertheless,
these tests often fail to detect tumor forming potential of transplanted cells effectively. So
really, the only thing to do is wait at least 4 years after the RPE treatment. Given that by
all appearances the biotech bubble may be popping right now, and that there is no proof
that OCAT's treatment won't result in tumors (quite the contrary, as we have seen
above), you should completely avoid this stock unless you have at least another 3 years
to wait and fund OCAT's seemingly endless dilution.


Furthermore, according to the FDA, the safety of stem cell-based therapies should be
confirmed case by case instead of looking into the statistical data, as with conventional
clinical trials. The monitoring conducted based on Ocata's RPE treatment studies cannot
completely ascertain the following:


The presence of residual tumor-forming cells in a non-tumor forming stem cell
population.


1.


The presence of certain undifferentiated stem cells that could transform into tumor(s)
after several years.


2.


These limitations are mainly due to the biological complexity and variation of stem cell
products as well as due to practical challenges in translating pre-clinical animal studies
into human studies.


In the OCAT studies, Robert Lanza and his team have "conducted" tumor detection
studies in all four study subjects and no evidence of tumor formation was observed,
despite the lack of reliable tumorigenicity tests due to variability and biological
complexity of stem cell products. Lanza and his team have followed-up with the patients
for just 12 months. Due to shorter lifespan than humans, monitoring the stem cell
transplanted animals for 12 months is common in animal studies, but not useful in
humans, as tumor formation is a long-term process in humans. For such a novel and
untested product with significant cancer risk, mice studies are just not going to cut it.


Significant Contradictory Evidence: The Data Have Spoken


When we research the published literature, several studies have contradicted Lanza and
Ocata's claims.

http://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/4/1/159
Apart from experimental animals, tumorigenesis can occur in humans after hESC
transplantation, according to an Israeli study. Although, the reported incident was based
on one patient (ataxia telengiactasia), it is still clinically relevant and it is something the
Cowen report completely failed to mention (no surprise there, it might have disrupted the
fee stream?). To treat the patient, the doctors transplanted fetal neural stem cells. After
four years, the patient has developed multiple tumors (teratomas) in the brain and
spinal column. Although, the transplant used in this study was fetal neural stem cells, it
is still derived from ESCs and relevant to Ocata. The study was the first to report the
occurrence of a human brain tumor as a complication of neural stem cell therapy. Note
that it took 4 years before the tumor was apparent in the subject, further underlining that
a mere 12 months of observation is insufficient.


Although, the risk was reported in neural stem cells, there is no guarantee that iPSC and
hESC-derived RPE stem cells are risk-free and won't cause tumors. It is now evident
that a tumor can occur even after several years (4 years or so). As a rule of thumb, to
confirm the long-term safety of any treatment, it is important to conduct a long-term,
observational study in the patients, which Ocata has just initiated three months ago.
Furthermore, by its nature, stem cell transplantation is not like drug treatment, so the
degree of treatment benefits and side effects may vary from one person to another. This
only further complicates the approval and safety verification process.


If the study is safe as Ocata claims, why were patients given
immunosuppressants?


Ocata has claimed that immune rejection of hESC RPE cell transplanted graft was not
evident in study subjects; nevertheless, the patients were given an immune suppressing
treatment, which is commonly prescribed in organ-transplanted patients. These drugs
are harsh on the body and can create significant adverse side effects in patients, as
they did in the OCAT study. If Ocata's safety claims are true, why were the engrafted
patients given immune suppressing drugs? This really doesn't make sense.

http://biomed.brown.edu/Courses/BI108/BI108_2004_Groups/Group04/Side_Effects.htm

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4437471/
Recall that the study focused on treating the patients' eyes. What should be noted is,
unlike other body parts, the eye is an immune-privileged site and the RPE cells were
reported to be immune-privileged tissue and hence the risk of immune attack on
transplanted cells is highly unlikely. Despite this well-known medical fact, Ocata has
treated ALL patients with immune suppressing drugs, which seems really irrational and
unnecessary - unless Ocata secretly believes there is a high risk that its treatment will
create tumors. The patients have suffered side effects such as pneumonia due to
immune suppressing drugs treatment.


When I reviewed Lanza's paper, I found references to the use of Tacrolimus (anti-
proliferative) and mycophenolate mofetil as immunosuppressive drugs in RPE cells-
treated patients. Both Tacrolimus (prevents DNA synthesis) and mycophenolate mofetil
are primarily immunosuppressive in nature but ALSO possess anti-tumor property
(prevents tumorigenesis). Now it makes sense to me - if there was no tumor risk from
RPE cell therapy then why use drugs that suppress tumors in an immune privileged
body site? It seems clear to me what is going on here.


There doesn't seem to be any reason to employ these immunosuppressive drugs except
to minimize the risk of tumors as they have no direct clinical relevance to RPE stem cell
therapy. How can anyone really say RPE therapy is safe based on four patients when
the company doing the testing appears to be concerned with the risk of tumors? It
seems Ocata is talking out of both sides of its mouth here.


More problems with Ocata's study design


According to FDA guidelines, utilization of large animals such as monkeys (non-human
primates) is recommended due to size, similarities between organs and body
parameters (heartbeat, temperature and immune system) considerations. Comparing
the treatment benefits and extrapolating the cell dose from small animals to humans,
which Ocata has done in the clinical trials listed above, is unviable.

Furthermore, according to the recent study published in the Lancet, both patients and
the clinical trial coordinators were aware of the treatment procedure, dose, and testing
methods (open-label) which is scientifically considered a potentially biased study design.
Usually, in early phase studies, to eliminate placebo effects, single-blinded study design
(patient-blinded) is often considered. Moreover, the study was a 'single-arm' study -
meaning, there is no active comparable group to compare the benefits and to prove the
superiority of the treatment, which is a huge red flag in clinical trials.


For its current SMD trial, Ocata has initiated a Phase I/II study and enrolled just 16
patients, despite the reported medium-term to long-term safety of hESC RPE cell
treatment in study subjects. This is another bad joke - a mere 16 patients? Even if this
study is completed, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn.


Competitive threats for Ocata


Due to failed 'science' and treatment inefficacy, I believe it is obvious Ocata will likely fail
in any rigorous clinical trials it ever attempts. Even if this RPE stem cell treatment can
manage to get through the approval process, Ocata has to face a tough, multi-pronged
commercial threat from several competitors who are ahead of OCAT in developing
therapies for AMD and SMD.


Sanofi (SNY) has been developing a virus-based gene therapy platform (SAR422459) to
deliver the gene into the affected area (retina) of Stargardt patients. At present, a Phase
I/IIa study is already underway.


Alkeus Pharmaceuticals has been developing a modified vitamin A analogue for SMD
treatment. In early studies, ALK-001 has shown a 70% reduction of toxic vitamin A
accumulation in the treated patients and the benefits have continued up to one year
after treatment. Based on the results of a Phase I/IIa study, a Phase-II study has been
initiated. According to Alkeus Pharmaceuticals, ALK-001 involves the use of a class of
compounds, which have been used for research purposes in humans for over 20 years
without side effects or adverse events. In the pre-clinical studies, no side effects were
observed up to 12 months of treatment, which is noteworthy to mention here.

Another little company you may have heard of called Roche (OTCQX:RHHBY) is
developing Lampalizumab, a bioengineered antibody pipeline that targets certain
inflammation causing immune proteins that cause AMD. Unlike Ocata's treatment,
Lampalizumab is not based on stem cell treatments. After recording successful results
in a Phase-II study, two Phase-III trials have been initiated that involved 900 patients to
ascertain the benefits in patients with geographic atrophy secondary to age-related
macular degeneration. Lampalizumab is way ahead of Ocata but also has shown a
relatively low rate of side effects. If all goes well, the IND will be filed by 2018, in my
opinion, based on the low side effects.


It seems extremely unlikely to me that Ocata will ever receive approval for its RPE
therapy, but if it does, it will likely have to face competitive threats from these apparently
superior treatments in the future. Furthermore, we can clearly see the presence of
existing threats from drugs that are already approved and have proven efficacy against
AMD and SMD.


For AMD, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN) Eylea and Genentech's Lucentis are the
formidable competitors that are already approved and available in the market. The long-
term follow-up study on Eylea has reported no significant serious side effects in Eylea-
treated patients, even after four years of treatment. In the AMD market, these two drugs
are the active competitors and pose a commercial threat to the 'non-existent' RPE
treatment for dry AMD.


In addition, Genentech's Avastin is being used for treatment of dry AMD (off-label) that
costs just $50/dose. Patients don't want to undergo an expensive treatment when there
is an alternative, cheaper but effective treatment available. Even most UK doctors have
urged the Government to allow the use of Avastin for AMD.


According to an analysis, when compared with Lucentis, Avastin did not increase the
risk of serious side effects or death. The results were based on a systematic review of
nine clinical trials, conducted by the Cochrane Collaboration.


Any way you cut it, Ocata is very far behind with ongoing safety overhangs and is years
away from proving safety.

Boris Peaker is a career biotechnology research analyst who worked for the now
defunct Rodman & Renshaw. Many of you know Rodman as the firm that was
responsible for bringing many alleged Chinese fraud RTOs to the market before it
ultimately went bankrupt.


After reviewing Peaker's track record at TipRanks.com, I have concerns about his stock
picking track record and independence as an analyst. Peaker was involved in
recommending Galena Biopharma, Inc. (GALE).


Anyone interested about learning more about Peaker's track record should check my
instablog.


Galena Biopharma, Inc.


November 26, 2013 - Outperform rating and $6 price target followed by another Buy
rating on January 13th, 2014, nearly top ticking this worthless biotech "pump and dump"
and creating significant negative alpha for anyone unfortunate enough to have followed
Mr. Peaker's recommendation. GALE stock was shown by multiple other authors to be
extremely risky.


Shortly after writing several excessively optimistic "research" reports on GALE, the firm
Peaker worked for at the time (Oppenheimer) was awarded the lead underwriter role
and paid $1,380,000 in fees, according to Capital IQ.


Others have written more about Galena and Boris.


Jason Kolbert's history also leaves much to be desired:

Jason Kolbert, an "analyst" currently working at Maxim, has been involved in
recommending small cap biotech stocks for quite some time. Unfortunately, for those
who thought his opinion was worth listening to, they appear to have experienced
devastating losses. Let's review Kolbert's track record as a small cap biotech analyst.
Those wanting additional information about Kolbert's track record, should check my
instablog here.


Ignore these analysts if you enjoy keeping your money


Where I'm from, any professional with a track record as bad as these two would
immediately be fired. The charts and the recommendations speak for themselves: there
is a clear pattern of value being destroyed over relatively short periods of time. It's clear
that any investor that wants to compound their investments positively should avoid Boris
Peaker's and Jason Kolbert's recommendations for small cap biotech stocks at all costs.


Furthermore, we can see from the research note that Cowen is highly conflicted with
regards to its research coverage of OCAT and should be completely ignored.
Specifically, the disclosures on the report says, "Cowen and Company, LLC and/or its
affiliates managed or co-managed a public offering of Ocata Therapeutics… within the
past 12 months."


OCAT is a zombie stock, pairs trade opportunity


It's clear based on the above that Ocata is likely a terrible investment at any price and
OCAT shares are very likely to be a total financial writeoff over time. The trials are poorly
constructed and inconclusive, the safety concerns have never been resolved for RPE
treatments, and the company is being touted by value destroying investment bankers.


Realistically, I think the best description for Ocata, which has accomplished nothing of
substance in its entire history while destroying a huge amount of capital, is that this is a
zombie stock. It has been shown that stem cell stocks have been terrible investments
over long periods of time. However, if you are determined to invest in this industry, do
yourself a favor and invest in Sanofi or Roche. In fact, shorting OCAT to zero and being
long any one of these companies would likely make an excellent pairs trade.

Losses

Before we get into the sections detailing massive losses sustained by Ocata
shareholders, excessive and insider compensation, let's briefly review the entire history
of failure at Ocata/Advanced Cell.


Long time followers of the Ocata disaster will already be familiar with the extensive
history of fraud allegations that have occurred at the company over the years (which is
detailed below, with direct quotes from a variety of lawsuits), so this section is primarily
for newcomers to the story. Whether a long time follower or new to the story, one thing is
clear: Ocata's DNA is as a vehicle that accomplishes little beyond enriching insiders and
I believe this has not changed since inception.


Ocata came public through a reverse merger with Two Moons Kachinas Corp., a
company that sells kachina dolls. Ocata's chief executive, William Caldwell said a
traditional IPO didn't make sense. I'm not sure merging with a Native American doll
company makes much sense either but OCAT appears to have embraced this legacy by
changing their name from Advanced Cell to Ocata, which according to their website is a
Native American name for healer.


Ocata's Predecessor, Advanced Cell, Accused of Fraud/The Aronson Era


Gary Aronson, one of the original OCAT financiers, brought a damning lawsuit against
Advanced Cell/Ocata for damages he suffered in 2006. In what will become an obvious
theme of the entire life of Ocata, the company approached Aronson in a desperate bid
to "obtain the funding necessary to keep the company alive." The lawsuit claims that
Advanced Cell "made false and misleading statements and omissions knowingly and
intentionally, or in such an extremely reckless and manner as to constitute willful deceit
and fraud upon Aronson." This case can be obtained on LexisNexis for a nominal fee,
case number 1:11-cv-11492-NMG.


The gist of the case is that Advanced Cell/Ocata owed Aronson two promissory notes
totaling $400,000 and Advanced Cell/Ocata defaulted on these notes. The company
then executed a shady reverse merger, in violation of a court order, which seems to me
to have been specifically designed to circumvent the amounts owed to Aronson? In my
view, this lawsuit is important to the current situation because it shows the cultural DNA
of Ocata.

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1140098/000101041205000003/form8k.txt
As you can see in the chart below, Ocata has consistently burned through vast sums of
capital in its continued pursuit of what I view as clearly unviable science. Unfortunately,
the Aronson lawsuit is not the only time that Ocata has been accused of entering
questionable financing deals.


The Compass Capital Debt for Equity Fraud Era


Ocata was previously involved in a debt for equity swap with Mark Lefkowitz and
Compass Capital that resulted in sanctions by the SEC for illegal debt-for-equity dilution
tactics. Once again, Ocata shows it's a company pursuing desperate financing
arrangements to stay afloat so insiders can reap the benefits. This case can be obtained
on LexisNexis for a nominal fee, case number 8:12-cv-01210-MSS-MAP.


According to a lawsuit by the SEC against Advanced Cell (Ocata) and Compass Capital,
the former CEO of Advanced Cell, William Caldwell IV, entered into a scheme in which
he collaborated with Compass Capital investor Mark Lefkowitz. Compass had a
business model of "illegally" (according to the lawsuit) purchasing debt from penny stock
issuers, converting the debt to unrestricted stock at multiples higher than the face value
of the debt, and then diluting the heck out of the stock and dumping it on the open
market to "public investors unaware of the dilutive effects of the new stock issuances."
Amazingly, Compass was brazen enough to then remit a portion of the sale proceeds to
the penny stock issuer (Advanced Cell/Ocata) itself, which was a method of raising
capital for Ocata. Many retail investors believe the stock market is rigged, and in cases
like this, I believe it basically was - rigged for huge dilution.



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/8/40228756_14399895729216_rId116.png

http://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/gateway.page
The lawsuit shows that Compass had pitched a variety of financing arrangements to
Advanced Cell/Ocata before settling on this "illegal distribution," which violated "the
antifraud and securities registration provisions of the federal securities laws," in part, it
seems, because Advanced Cell/Ocata was so desperate for financing. As a result of the
fraud, Compass was later barred from participating in any penny stock offering.


As we will see later on, Ocata remains very desperate for financing, and in my view, is
one failed equity raise away from bankruptcy, once again engaging in a desperate
equity financing arrangement that I think will end in disaster (see more below in the
Lincoln Park Capital section of this report).


As a result of fraudulent debt for equity swaps, as well as desperate financing
arrangements such as the current arrangement OCAT is stuck with, shareholders have
been subject to ongoing significant dilution, the likes of which have rarely been
witnessed in the history of the US capital markets. In my view, no real company
engages in a series of financing transactions of these types - this type of behavior is
indicative of unviable companies, in my view, which is what I believe OCAT is.


The Motive for this Company: Insider Enrichment at Ocata


Let's first look at how badly minority shareholders have been abused and then take a
look at who has gained out of the Ocata disaster: insiders.


Ocata: Insiders Funding Their Own Wealth with Amazing Dilution


Source: Capital IQ and SEC filings


Ocata: Shareholders lost 98% since the peak, still not a value



https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/8/40228756_14399895729216_rId118.png
Source: Capital IQ


The meaning of these charts is clear: OCAT has survived through desperate financing
arrangements that have created huge dilution for shareholders. The stock price has
reacted appropriately, losing 98% of its value since the peak over a decade ago. OCAT
is a veritable shareholder value destruction machine that has burned through a
whopping $356,000,000 of shareholder capital. When a company like this is allowed to
continue destroying value for shareholders, it risks undermining a very competitive
advantage of the United States: The quality of our capital markets. In my opinion, stocks
like OCAT are a national embarrassment and should be removed from the stock market
entirely.


Fool Me Once, Shame on You. Fool me Twice, Shame on Me.


While shareholders have suffered horrible dilution, insiders have gotten rich for more
than a decade. Robert Lanza alone has made nearly $15 million according to publicly
available compensation data during a time in which the share price declined ~98%. The
insider compensation is breathtaking:

The Robert Lanza Promotional Playbook - Science by Press Release

Robert Lanza has been Ocata's Chief Science Officer for over a decade. Lanza has a
long history of being involved in scientific fiascos that have involved publicly issuing
highly optimistic sounding statements generating public exposure. Over the last 2
decades, these "findings" have never materialized into substantive progress towards an
economically viable FDA approved therapy but were successful in promoting both
Robert Lanza and increasing Ocata's stock price. This process was coined "Science by
Press Conference [Release]" and has been heavily criticized by the scientific
community. Below, we will parse through Lanza's and Ocata's excruciatingly long history
of failures that includes significant indications that the science by press release tactic
has been going on for over a decade at Ocata without meaningful results. In my opinion,
it's likely these press releases are being used to manipulate the stock price to continue
enriching insiders, including Lanza himself.


A flurry of articles were written by respected organizations including the New York
Times, National Geographic and NPR that claimed Lanza/Ocata developed a new stem
cell method that avoided destroying embryos. Lanza himself said a single cell can be
removed from an eight-cell human embryo without causing any apparent harm to the
embryo and that "there is no rational reason left to oppose this research."


These press releases were extremely successful in increasing Ocata's share price. The
day the articles were published OCAT saw its price per share increase by over 300%
only to further dilute shareholders several days later, according to Capital IQ.


Outside of the obvious red flags of timing press releases to increase the share price and
further dilute shareholders through a private placement, it was later found that the
articles were flat out wrong and created a "materially false impression" and had omitted
crucial information that the embryos had been destroyed, presumably by Lanza or other
scientists at OCAT. Robert George of The Washington Post stated:

http://www.bizzyblog.com/2006/08/27/was-advanced-cells-breakthrough-that-wasnt-a-financial-ploy-or-worse/
"Unfortunately, just about none of this is true. First, the study did not involve the
removal of one cell from an embryo that then continued to develop. Instead,
researchers disaggregated 16 living embryos, killing them all, and took an average
of six cells from each. The 91 resulting embryonic cells were then placed near one
another in dishes and allowed to divide. Some divided, while others died, and from
the cells that divided researchers were able to produce two lines of embryonic stem
cells. In other words, this study does essentially nothing to prove the point that
Advanced Cell Technology (the company that carried out the experiments) has
argued in the press: that single cells removed from an early embryo and cultured by
themselves can produce lines of embryonic stem cells."


Another press release was issued that apparently claimed Advanced Cell/Ocata
scientists had created the first cloned human embryos. Robert Lanza went on to say
that Ocata's intentions are "to make lifesaving therapies for a wide range of human
disease conditions, including diabetes, stroke, cancer, AIDS, and neuerodegenerative
disorders such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease." Why would Robert Lanza
make what appear to be such obviously empty statements while his own research was
quickly and thoroughly debunked by the scientific community? Noble laureate Paul Berg
of Stanford University said "this is not a breakthrough or even a scientific contribution"
further adding that "the experiment was a failure and does not warrant the amount of
press coverage it has received." A cloning expert at Massachusetts Institute of
Technology said that Robert Lanza's findings were "third-rate science."


I think Robert George said it best in describing the stunt that Lanza/Ocata pulled off as
being "one grossly hyped study published by a publicity-hungry biotech firm." In
my opinion, this accurately describes the Lanza/Ocata legacy: issue press releases of
questionable scientific merit only to further financially abuse retail shareholders. Over a
decade later, and as far as I can tell, OCAT has made no meaningful progress in the
possibilities discussed above. Insiders have made a lot of money though, you have to
give them credit.


History of Insider Enrichment


Some of these insiders have a long prior history of destroying shareholder value as well.


PhyMatrix: The Michael Heffernan Wipeout Saga

https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9873-hype-accusation-blights-stem-cell-breakthrough/
Michael Heffernan is the Chairman of the Board of Ocata and has previously allegedly
supported efforts to use publicly traded vehicles for the enrichment of insiders, to the
detriment of non-insider shareholders, resulting in massive shareholder losses and
lawsuits. Based on my research, it seems all signs point to this once again currently
occurring at Ocata.


We know that Heffernan has a history of direct involvement in shareholder wipeouts
amid allegations of wrongdoing. I will cover these issues in a moment but for now let's
review an instructive chart of the PhyMatrix disaster, later renamed Innovative Clinical
Solutions, which declared Chapter 11 and completely wiped out shareholders.


Source: Capital IQ


Michael Heffernan was one of the architects of the PhyMatrix/ICSL wipeout, a capital
markets disaster that resulted in a negative retained earnings balance of $311,298,000
(this means the company lost that much while insiders personally got wealthy).


In fact, I estimate Heffernan made $2.6 million.


Source: Table built by me with data from SEC filings


Although businesses can and do fail, the PhyMatrix wipeout appears to have been no
accident according to a lawsuit filed after the bankruptcy. This lawsuit directly named
Michael Heffernan as a defendant and contained serious allegations. The case is
available on LexisNexis as Bond Opportunity Fund II, LLC v Michael Heffernan.

The suit alleges claims for "securities fraud" (direct quote) against current and former
senior officers and directors, including Michael Heffernan who was President and Co-
Chief Executive Officer of PhyMatrix during the period in question and co-signed
relevant SEC documents referred to in the lawsuit. The lawsuit was filed on behalf of
convertible bondholders who experienced permanent capital loss based on allegedly
false and misleading SEC filings. Specifically plaintiffs alleged:


"Each of the defendants acted with scienter in that each defendant [including
Heffernan]: knew, or in the absence of recklessness should have known, of facts, and
had access to material information, suggesting that public documents and statements
referenced above which were disseminated, filed or issued by, or in the name of the
Company were materially false or misleading… and knowingly or recklessly
participated in the dissemination, filing or issuance of such documents and
statements, as primary violators of federal securities laws."


Furthermore, "through such statements, omissions and conduct, the Company
intended to and did create and maintain artificially inflated market prices for the
common stock (and therefore the Convertible Debentures) of the Company."


In other words, according to this lawsuit, my interpretation of this is that insiders
engaged in an allegedly reckless course of action that involved misleading the market
and enrichment. Any shareholder or convertible bondholder who acted upon the
information publicly disseminated by the company experienced significant shareholder
losses.


Although it's not a crime for company insiders to be wrong or make mistakes in the
normal course of business, what makes this lawsuit particularly alarming is the direct
and misleading level of enrichment these insiders seem to have enjoyed at the expense
of common shareholders.


The "misleading course of conduct" allegations included:


Blatantly false SEC documents that resulted in the material overstatement of nearly
$100,000,000 of pretax income of the business.


1.


Forgiving substantial seven-figure loans to insiders when the company was in the
process of losing over $300,000,000 (not a typo!).


2.



http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1002022/000091205700027025/a10-k.txt
A share repurchase plan in "which the Company spent millions of dollars
repurchasing its shares on the open market during a period when the Company was
insolvent."


3.


That insiders created a "false and misplaced sense of confidence" in the company's
fair market value.


4.


That the company was repurchasing its shares in the open market and making false
claims while insiders were selling their own holdings.


5.


That the company insiders were reckless in their deployment of company resources
while PhyMatrix's financial situation had badly deteriorated.


6.


"Defendants employed a device, scheme or artifice to defraud Plaintiffs, and made
untrue statements of material facts…"


7.


That PhyMatrix ultimately declared Chapter 11, completely wiping out the stock.8.


As a closing remark, one quote in particular stands out: "The aggregate impact of
defendants' actions was catastrophic."


Why would anyone ever invest with this guy? Especially given the culture at Ocata,
which seems to me more or less a repeat of the PhyMatrix debacle - insiders getting rich
while shareholders have been burned for over $300 million in losses.


We can see in the Ocata insider compensation chart above that according to SEC
documents, Heffernan has made at least $1.3 million while at Ocata. For what? Is Ocata
next?


Paul Wotton's History


Wotton is Ocata's CEO, who previously has held several executive positions at Antares
Pharma, Inc. (ATRS) from 2006 to 2014. Under Wotton's leadership, ATRS accumulated
a deficit of $215,235,330 while he personally made millions by my estimates.

https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2015/8/40228756_14399895729216_rId146.png
Wotton joined OCAT just last year and wasted no time in accepting one of the most
insider enriching compensation packages I've ever seen, all at the expense of OCAT
shareholders! Wotton's track record seems to produce consistently large retained
earnings deficits and hefty enriching compensation packages, while investors swallow
near complete losses on their investment. According to the OCAT employment
agreement, Wotton will receive an annual base salary of $575,000, incentive
compensation of up to $316,250, options to purchase 300,000 shares of common stock
and stock unit awards equaling 300,000 shares of common stock. (These estimated
amounts are adjusted for the 1:100 split that occurred in August, the original filing states
30M shares.)


If Wotton truly believes that OCAT has a promising future and is aware that OCAT is
rapidly running out of cash, why would he accept such an excessive compensation
package, that seems to only accelerate Ocata's path to bankruptcy?


It appears that Paul Wotton knows the severity of the problems at OCAT. Just last
month, he decided to cash in on his compensation package by dumping 32,500 shares
at an average price of $4.23 raking in total proceeds of $267,500. According to the filing,
Wotton literally sold his shares the day they became vested. Why is Paul Wotton so
eager to sell his stock to retail investors if positive developments are just right around
the corner? What does he know that the retail shareholder base doesn't? This is
obviously a terrible sign indicative of the end times for OCAT are probably soon
approaching.

Robert Langer isn't any better from what I can tell. He's been involved in numerous
shareholder wipeouts while receiving hefty compensation packages.

"I consider this a public service announcement for anyone who invests in small cap
biotech. After selling out of Ocata Therapeutics, I no longer have skin in the game. It's
time to move on and focus on making profits vs. avoiding losses. But before I do, I
wanted to close the loop. As expected, the amendment to substantially increase the
authorized stock available for employee stock options and allow management to
lower the strike price at will passed with flying colors. A shareholder who attended
the meeting reported that the corporate attorney actually made a money
gesture to the CFO (rubbing his thumb and index finger together) during the
reading of the proxy material!"


I was not personally at the meeting and cannot confirm this, but it wouldn't surprise me.
Any questions or comments should be directed to Bullard's Investments for confirmation.


Ocata: How Insider Enrichment Is Supported by Wall Street - An Ecosystem of
Bad Behavior


The Painful Lincoln Park Capital Financing/Ocata is Nearly Insolvent


As of the most recent earnings report, OCAT has burned $356,000,000 during its life as
a public company. The company tried to raise capital with a traditional equity offering in
February 2015 during the hottest biotech market in a generation but had to "terminate
the offering" which seems to imply no institutional investor would back the deal. Ocata
files an S-3 for $100 million mixed shelf offering only to withdraw it a few months later
due to "market conditions."


This inability to get a deal done has increased the overall risk of bankruptcy of Ocata
and suggests that smart biotech investors passed on the opportunity. In fact, we know
that 81% of the company is owned by retail investors, which itself seems to be a very
telling sign.

This failed capital offering has left Ocata in a precarious and unviable financial position:
Ocata's cash balance is dwindling as the company is burning tens of millions a year in
cash flow, a large portion of which is going to insiders as compensation. It should be no
surprise then that the company's largest shareholder is trying to aggressively cash out
by selling their stock. This investor is Lincoln Park Capital, which has a checkered
history of investing in public companies (more on this below).


In fact, Ocata has had to turn to Lincoln Park Capital after the company terminated its
equity offering. In my view, Lincoln Park is basically the bottom of the barrel among
equity lenders of last resort. Evidence to support my opinion is provided below, but it's
also worth showing a very recent example of what a bomb Lincoln Park can be for a
public company's stock price. I present to you Exhibit A: Unilife (UNIS).


Like Ocata, Unilife has a long and checkered history as a public company, creating
significant controversy. So far bears have been right at every turn.


Since the Lincoln Park bomb was announced at Unilife on July 30th, 2015, Unilife
shareholders have been taken out to the woodshed, losing approximately 25% of their
investment in just weeks, as UNIS is most likely on its way to zero because of the
company's significant debt load. Since announcing their agreement with Lincoln Park,
Unilife's stock has declined 28%.


I have no position in UNIS stock.


Is OCAT next?

On June 27th, 2014, Lincoln Park Capital, LLC entered into an agreement with OCAT to
purchase up to $30 million of Ocata stock over the next 36 months. Based on available
data, to date, Ocata has issued 2,500,000 shares resulting in gross proceeds of $17.5
million. Lincoln Park Capital receives favorable treatment for the shares it purchases
including paying the lowest sale price on the date the stock is purchased or the average
of the 3 lowest closing sale prices during 10 consecutive business days. These types of
financing arrangements have resulted in significant price declines at a number of prior
Lincoln Park investments, which I believe is currently creating a significant enduring
overhang on OCAT's stock price.


Let's take a look at past Lincoln Park financings that I believe are illustrative of the future
at Ocata:


At Golden Phoenix Minerals, Lincoln Park Capital registered to sell shares July 5th,
2011. The price of Golden Phoenix has done very poorly since this filing. The price has
declined 98% between the registration and now.

Why would Ocata ever in a million years agree to work with these capital partners?
There are only two reasons I can see:


Ocata is desperate for any money it can get, at any terms, presumably so that
insiders can continue to draw aggressive compensation packages while pursuing
unviable science.


1.


The company is totally unviable, no major biotech investors would touch this lame
pony, and Lincoln Park was literally the equity lender of last resort.


2.


OCAT's IR Firm Also Has a Terrible Small Cap Biotech Track Record


Westwicke Partners is the investor relations firm for OCAT. I looked into Westwicke's
background and found that they have an extensive history of being involved with
struggling small cap biotech companies that appear to continually destroy value for their

and the returns they delivered to investors.

There is clearly a troubling pattern emerging from public companies that Westwicke
Partners serves and with this track record it's probably in the best interests of investors
to avoid these type of situations at all costs. As it pertains to OCAT, given the evidence
that's been discussed so far, is it even worth owning shares in OCAT knowing that there
is a high probability that these patterns will repeat themselves?


Even more concerning, when we look at the public holders of OCAT, none of them have
particularly respectable track records especially in the context of a raging biotech bull
market. Furthermore, not one respectable healthcare or biotech fund that didn't receive
a "sweetener" owns OCAT. What does that say about OCAT's prospects? All of the
respectable biotech/healthcare investors came to the same conclusion: that OCAT has a
completely unviable offering that will never make economic sense from an investment
perspective.

In fact, the only funds that seem to own OCAT are Lincoln Park and a handful of
Electronically Traded Funds (ETF) that by definition lack any amount of common sense
to realize what other healthcare/biotech funds seem to have concluded: this company is
not worth an investment even in a raging biotech bull market. The ETFs and other retail
products have been forced buyers due to the Russell rebalancing. In a likely scenario
where OCAT is removed from the Russell after the share price is crushed by the Lincoln
Park deal, further dilution, and unviable science, my opinion is that forced selling by
these same ETFs will cause this to be removed from the indices commencing a large
sell off. Once retail shareholders figure out they have been fooled, further selling will
send this small cap biotech stock into a tailspin.

InvestorStemCell.com is a website that primarily contains message boards for publicly
traded stem cell and regenerative medicine companies. Jason T. Gruner controls
InvestorStemCell.com and is Founder of Stem Cell Media, LLC. InvestorStemCell.com
is a website that I believe is pretending to be a legitimate discussion board when in
reality its primary purpose seems to me to be a platform to promote publicly traded
companies. InvestorStemCell.com sends out blatantly promotional emails to retail
investors claiming that they have an "edge" on the market. That edge is clearly
displayed in the following excerpt from an email sent out by Jason T. Gruner:


"Ask yourself how much a company is worth that can heal a broken heart? $90
Billion? $500 Billion? A Trillion Dollars or more? How much would you pay for a
treatment that will regenerate your damaged heart and allow you to breath air for
another 30 years of life?"


They may very well have an edge, but their edge seems to be in finding stocks that lose
shareholders a lot of money. Below is the performance of the company that was
referenced in the previous excerpt. Please note that shares trade for about $0.006,
which means if you invested in Bioheart, Inc. (OTCPK:BHRT) at almost any point, you
lost substantially all of your money. In most cases, 99% of your investment evaporated.

I also find it odd that the website features an "Ocata Merchandise Center" which is the
only company I've found with its own dedicated merchandising page. Could there be a
