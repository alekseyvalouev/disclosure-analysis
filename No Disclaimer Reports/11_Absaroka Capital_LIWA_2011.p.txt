Executive Summary – Lihua 
International, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIWA) 


Absaroka Capital Management, LLC (“Absaroka”) is short Lihua International, Inc. (“Lihua” or 


the “Company”, a/k/a Plastron Acquisition Corp.)(NASDAQ: LIWA).  In this Initiating Coverage 


Report, Absaroka will provide compelling evidence that indicates Lihua has materially 


misrepresented its business to investors and thus is significantly overvalued.  After the 


numerous fraud-related implosions of Chinese companies listed in North America in the last 12 


months, investors should exercise extreme caution when investing in the space.  Absaroka’s 


main concerns about Lihua include the following material issues: 


1. Self-Dealing and Related Party Transactions – Overlapping Danyang Huaying Resource 


Recycling, Ltd. ownership raises significant concerns about Management motivations 


2. Illogical Financial Results – Unsustainable margins or indicative of accounting 


shenanigans and corporate malfeasance? 


3. Supplier Relationships – Difficult to reconcile public claims with business reality  


4. Illogical and Repeated Secondary Share Issuances – Is the cash balance real? 


5. Implausibly Large Asset Costs – Management appears to be misallocating CAPEX spend 


based on market comparables  


6. Scrap Import License – Limited opportunity for value creation due to increased sourcing 


competition, volatile commodity prices, and significant working capital requirements 


7. Auditors Track Record – Raises significant concerns about the validity of published 


financials and future business prospects  


8. Excessive Stock Promotion – Management appears uniquely focused on stock 


promotion as it has hosted 11 significant investor events YTD 


Any of these serious issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public 


shareholders to question the current $6.75/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” 


form of shareholder activism. 





Recommendation:  CONVICTION SELL 
Estimated Fundamental Value: $3.00
Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 4 
 


Introduction: Public Claims vs. Reality 
Lihua International runs a simple manufacturing business. The Company buys scrap copper, 


melts it down, and casts it into anodes and rods, which are basically blocks of purified copper. 


Lihua also processes CCA (copper-clad aluminum) fine and magnet wire. Both of these business 


segments are low-margin, commodity manufacturing processes with low barriers to entry, in 


which dozens of Chinese companies ruthlessly compete for market share based on being the 


lowest-cost producer.  


Since completing its reverse merger listing with Plastron Acquisition Corp in 2008, Lihua has 


purportedly achieved astronomical fiscal growth, despite highly volatile copper pricing and 


fickle demand trends. 





Absaroka sought to independently verify these purported financial results by retrieving Lihua’s 


financial statements from the local branch of the State Administration for Industry and 


Commerce (“SAIC”) in the People’s Republic of China. However, the SAIC office in Danyang, the 


small city where Lihua is headquartered, refused requests through Registered Agents to access 


the complete current financial filings, which should be part of the available public records 


documents.  Absaroka considers this SAIC office response highly unusual and as a result is 


particularly skeptical of the purported SAIC documents and reconciliation posted on the Lihua 


Investor Relations website on 07/07/11.  Since the Company is listed in the United States, if 


Lihua Management is inducing SAIC officers via bribes or other “facilitation payments” to 


ensure the current Lihua SAIC records are not available for public review as is standard in the 


PRC, this action would be an egregious violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 


and expose the Company to significant legal and regulatory risk.1 


In this report, Absaroka will provide compelling evidence that indicates Lihua has materially 


misrepresented its business to investors and thus is significantly overvalued.

1.   Self-Dealing and Related Party Transactions – Raises significant 


concerns about Management motivations 
Absaroka’s research indicates that Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd., a company that is 


registered at the same address as Lihua, also provides a portion of Lihua’s purported copper 


supply.  More importantly, Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd. is owned by Ms. WANG 


Yaying (Lihua’s Chief Operating Officer, Secretary and Director and also the wife of Mr. ZHU 


Jianhua, Lihua Chairman/CEO2), Ms. WANG Liying (sister of Ms. WANG Yaying, Lihua COO, and 


sister-in-law of Lihua Chairman/CEO, Mr. ZHU Jianhua), and one other likely related party 


(Figure 1).  This business relationship obviously raises a plethora of conflict of interest concerns 


and has not been disclosed in Lihua’s SEC filings.  Moreover, this cozy relationship would make 


it easy for Lihua to potentially mislead its auditor by massaging its purported production 


volume and COGS reporting information.

Absaroka’s in-country investigators spoke with a source familiar with the WANG family who 


confirmed 1) Ms. WANG Yaying and Ms. WANG Liying are sisters, 2) Ms. WANG Yaying and Mr. 


ZHU Jianhua are married.  In addition, the PRC ID verifications of Ms. WANG Yaying and Ms. 


WANG Liying show the same ancestral home and the ID digit sequence indicates a similar place 


of issuance at birth (Figure 2). 


According to Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd.’s 2009 SAIC filings (the most recent 


publicly available), the firm generated revenue of approximately $43.2mm on $14.4mm in total 


assets.  Also, the firm supposedly has only six employees and Ms. WANG Liying is the Legal 


Representative, Chairwoman and General Manager.  However, as per the PRC ID verifications 


included in Figure 2, Ms. WANG Liying’s actual employer is the Danyang City Tianyi Electronic 


Factory.  In addition, because of Ms. WANG Liying’s middle school level of education, it is 


extremely difficult to believe Lihua Management is not involved in the administration and 


operations of Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd.

Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 6 
 


Next, Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd. was established on 06/23/08, roughly the same 


time that Fushi Copperweld, Inc., which had been Lihua’s largest CCA-wire supplier, ended its 


supply relationship with the Company.  According to the SAIC filings, the Danyang Huaying 


Resource Recycling, Ltd. registered equity capital was increased to ¥41mm (~$5mm at 2008 FX 


rates) on 12/31/08. 


As mentioned above, the Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd. (Registration #: 


321181000080352) SAIC registered address of Danyang City Houxiangzhen Wuxing Industrial 


Zone is exactly the same SAIC registered address as Lihua’s Jiangsu Lihua Copper Industry Co., 


Ltd. (Registration #: 321181400005356).  Absaroka’s in-country investigators canvassed the 


Danyang City Houxiangzhen Wuxing Industrial Zone and surrounding area, but were only able 


to locate Lihua facilities.  In addition, local canteen employees, migrant workers and local 


government officials were all generally familiar with Lihua, but none had heard of Danyang 


Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd.  Thus, Absaroka strongly believes Lihua Management controls 


Danyang Huaying Resource Recycling, Ltd. and operates it out of the same Lihua facilities.   


From a gross margin perspective, the brokering of copper scrap is slightly more attractive than 


the low-margin, highly competitive businesses of copper manufacturing, such as smelting, 


casting, or drawing.  The copper manufacturing value chain generally has low single digit gross 


margins, while the scrap trading gross margin can be a lucrative 15%.
3
  Thus, Absaroka 


questions whether Lihua Management has retained this more profitable part of the business for 


its own family at the expense of its public shareholders.  Moreover, this conflicted business 


relationship appears to violate every basic tenant of public company governance and internal 


controls.

2.   Illogical Financial Results – Unsustainable margins or indicative of 


accounting shenanigans and corporate malfeasance? 
Lihua’s financial results make do not make sense relative to its peers, especially when comparing 


gross margins.  In FY10, Lihua reported a consolidated gross margin of 16.8% and an 8.7% gross 


margin for the Copper Anode business segment, despite the fact it was the Company’s first year of 


operation in the anode market and it was competing for customers against established producers.  


At best, Lihua’s reported financial results appear unsustainable over time due to competitive pricing 


pressures and, at worst, could be a clear indication of accounting shenanigans and corporate 


malfeasance. 


Absaroka’s in-country investigator spoke with the Chief Engineer of Baotou Copper Smelting Group, 


a large copper processing firm, about current dynamics in the Chinese copper market.  The Chief 


Engineer, who has over 10 years of experience with Baotou, stated the market is very price 


sensitive and numerous companies ruthlessly compete for business.  According to the Chief 


Engineer, copper anode manufacturing in China normally realizes a gross margin of 2%-5%, while 


copper wire processing generally realizes gross margins of 5%-8%. Below is a table of FY10 financial 


results of Chinese copper market participants.

Difficult to Believe Lihua’s Reported Gross Margins  


Relative to its Peers’ Financial Performance
Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 9 
 


3.   Supplier Relationships – Difficult to reconcile public claims with 


business reality 
Lihua claims to be currently refining 50,000 tons per annum of copper and thus would require a 


monthly input supply of approximately 4,150 tons.
4
  For reference, in FY10, Lihua’s total 


production volume was 44,712 metric tons of CCA and copper wire, copper anode, and copper 


rod.
 5


  However, after speaking with Lihua’s disclosed suppliers and channel checks with other 


potential suppliers, Absaroka finds it difficult to believe the Company is producing the total 


volume of copper claimed because the amount of inputs provided to Lihua indicates a 


significantly smaller operation.  In FY10, Lihua’s five largest suppliers reportedly represented 


51% of total purchases and the Company’s single largest supplier accounted for 12.9% of total 


purchases.
 6





Lihua’s Reported Suppliers as per FY10 10-K 


Jinhailuo Recycling Metal Co., Ltd. 


Jinhailuo appears to be Lihua’s largest named supplier.  It has one main factory, which is not 


involved in the copper trade, and two subsidiaries. Absaroka’s in-country investigators 


contacted the main subsidiary, called “Jinshun Metal Plastic Co. Ltd.,” whose employees said 


they provide approximately one and a half trucks (40-60 tons per truck) of scrap copper to 


Lihua every month. This scrap copper is imported from Japan and Taiwan, and volumes remain 


relatively consistent throughout the year.  


Yian Recycling Metal Co., Ltd. 


Yian is located in “Asia Metal Resources Recycling Industry Base” in Zhaoqing City in 


Guangdong. There are more than 20 companies in this location, and only their regular 


customers can gain access.  Thus, Absaroka’s in-country investigators were unable to get access 


to the industrial base to verify the information directly with the company, but anecdotal 


evidence indicates their scale is rather limited. 


Nanhai Huabi Metal Co., Ltd.  


According to a Huabi salesman, the company provided scrap copper to Lihua in 1H10, importing 


from overseas and reselling to Lihua in monthly volumes of approximately two 40-ton trucks. 


However, the company did not have access to imports of copper scrap in 2H10 and thus 


provided no scrap to Lihua in the second half of 2010.  


Nanhai Meiyada Metal Co., Ltd. 


The Nanhai Meiyada name did not appear on the entrance to the premises of the company’s 


registered address. Absaroka’s in-country investigators found only a few tons of scrap and few

the registered address were unable to tell Absaroka’s in-country investigators any information 


relating to Lihua. 


Nanhai Tianyuanhe Metal Co., Ltd. 


Nanhai Tianyuanhe owns three factories in the Danyang area. One factory’s sales staff stated 


Lihua generally purchases scrap copper from the company on a monthly basis, with total 


shipment volumes of approximately one to two 40-ton trucks.

At Lihua’s Investor and Analyst Day at the Danyang Facility on 05/24/11, a previously 


undisclosed supplier, Tuoli International, Ltd., was introduced to investors as a major supplier 


to the Company. Mr. ZHANG Yi, CEO of Tuoli, claimed to be a longtime supplier to Lihua, but he 


did not disclose the amount of copper he supplied to Lihua. 


Also, another peculiar speaker at Lihua’s Investor and Analyst Day at the Danyang Facility was 


Mr. ZHANG Qianshu, Trade Department Vice Director, of the Tongling Metal Group subsidiary, 


Zhangjiagang United Copper Company.  At the Investor Day, Mr. ZHANG Qianshu indicated that 


he was the chief copper anode procurement official for Zhangjiagang United Copper Company 


and the company purchases approximately 30,000 tons of copper anode per year from Lihua.  


In a follow-up discussion with Absaroka’s in-country researchers, Mr. ZHANG Qianshu appears 


to have perjured himself by stating Zhangjiagang United Copper has been purchasing copper 


anode from Lihua for “three to four years.”  Absaroka notes that in Lihua's 2010 Annual Report, 


the Company stated "in August of 2010, we began production and sales of copper anode."

4.   Illogical and Repeated Secondary Share Issuances – Is the Cash 


Balance Real? 
In general, fraudsters don’t perpetuate a fraudcap for fun; instead, a scoundrel management team 


will keep the scheme running to misappropriate cash from public shareholders.  In addition, one of 


the easiest ways to misappropriate cash from public shareholders is via unnecessary secondary 


share issuances. 


On 09/04/09, Lihua raised $8.6mm in proceeds via the secondary issuance of 2.3mm shares at a 


gross price of $4.00/share.
8
  As per the most recent 10-Q before the offering, Lihua supposedly had 


$28.1mm in cash and equivalents and only $4.4mm in bank loans outstanding.
9
 Revenue for 1H09 


was $69.4mm and net income was $10.7mm, up 180% and 83.1% from 1H08, respectively.  Lihua 


reportedly generated positive operating cash flow in both 1H08 and FY07.  The planned Use of 


Proceeds for the 2009 offering was “working capital and general corporate purposes” as per the 


offering prospectus. 


On 04/14/10, Lihua again tapped the United States capital markets for $32.5mm in proceeds from 


the sale of 4.3mm shares at a gross price of $8.05/share.
10


  As of the most recent 10-K filing before 


the offering, Lihua supposedly had $34.6mm cash and equivalents, only $2.2mm in bank loans 


outstanding, and an FY09 Operating Cash Flow of $8.4mm.
11


  The planned Use of Proceeds for the 


2010 offering was once again “general corporate purposes” as per the offering prospectus, 


although the road-show presentation indicated the funds would actually be utilized for the 


construction of a new smelting facility.

stakes, despite Lihua’s purportedly continuous operational growth and cash flow generation.

After the LFT, CHBT, CCME, and other Chinese fraudcap implosions, it should be painfully clear to 


equity investors that malicious management teams are willing to fabricate bank statements, corrupt 


local bank officials, and create fake banking websites in order to pass audit opinions.
14


  In a 


significant portion of the Chinese fraudcaps to detonate in 2011, an outsized reported cash balance 


relative to business needs has been a common theme (Figure 4).

In Absaroka’s opinion, with Lihua’s 03/31/11 reported cash balance of $90.7mm, the Company 


would have the capacity to have completed at least $60.0mm in share repurchases in FY11 based 


on the continued positive operating cash flow generation of the business and the allegedly 


depressed trading value of the Company’s stock.  Instead, Lihua has only repurchased 97,600 shares 


at a VWAP of $9.49 per share in FY11 and was forced to sign a loan agreement to borrow up to 


$4.0mm from Mr. ZHU Jianhua’s Magnify Wealth Enterprise Limited to fund the share 


repurchases.
15





In summary, Absaroka strongly believes the Lihua reported cash balance of $90.7mm relative to its 


asset base and business needs should be a significant red flag for investors.

Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 13 
 


5.   Implausibly Large Asset Costs – Management appears to be 


misallocating CAPEX spend based on market comparables 
Absaroka hypothesizes that Lihua has over-reported the costs of its CAPEX and acquisitions in 


an attempt to subsidize its cash operating costs.  For example, in FY10, Lihua commenced an 


expansion project to increase its copper anode production capacity by 50,000 tpa. While the 


Company claims that this expansion will cost up to $40.0mm, after multiple discussions with 


various industry experts, Absaroka strongly believes the actual project cost is closer to 


$20.0mm. 


$USD mm Lihua Claimed CAPEX  Absaroka Estimated Actual CAPEX 


Land $10.0 $5.0 


Factory Building $10.0-15.0 $5.9 


Factory Equipment  $15.0 $6.2 


Total $35.0-40.0 $17.1 
Net CAPEX Delta  $17.9-22.9 





Potentially Fabricated “Relocation Costs” 


During Lihua’s Investor and Analyst Day at the Danyang Facility on 05/24/11, the Company 


could not keep its story straight on the cost of its recent land acquisition for the factory 


expansion.  Originally, investors were told that the land for the factory cost $10.0mm.  


However, later in the day, the IR director stated the land acquisition cost was only $5.0mm, but 


then explained $5.0mm was also spent on the relocation of existing residents. Separately, Mr. 


Yang “Roy” Yu, Lihua’s 28-year old Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer, stated $5.0mm was 


allocated for the land and $5.0mm was required for physical site preparation, rather than 


relocation of residents.
 16





Based on recent land transaction comparables in the area, Absaroka believes a cost of 


approximately 32.4mm RMB ($5.0mm USD) for 120,000 square meters (180 mu) of land in that 


area is more reasonable. Absaroka has compared the prices of similar industrial land in 


Danyang (Figure 5), and Absaroka’s in-country investigators interviewed the Danyang 


Investment Promotion Bureau for details on the local real estate market.  According to Danyang 


officials, a relocation fee or land clearing fee of $5.0mm is without basis, especially considering 


the plot is only 180mu. According to PRC government policy, all land that is transferred must be 


cleared by the local government before the public auction and a buyer is not responsible for 


relocation costs or land clearing. Absaroka also confirmed with the Danyang Investment 


Promotion Bureau that all land sold in the region is ready for development.

More curious is Lihua’s disclosure that it has failed to make full payment for the land and 


therefore has not received title. In the 2010 10-K, Lihua states:  


“As of December 31, 2010, prepaid land-use rights included RMB32,391,910 


($4,834,893), representing payments made by Lihua Copper to a local authority 


to acquire a 50-year right to use a parcel of land which will be used for expansion 


of its manufacturing facilities. As of December 31, 2010, RMB2,391,910 


($361,168) remained unpaid, and no land use right certificate had been issued 


and the relevant formalities were not completed.”
 18





Despite not having received the land use rights, Lihua claims to have spent an additional 


$5.4mm, still without legal title: 


“Apart from the payment of $4,891,043 to the local authority, the Company also 


paid $5,359,456 in connection with the acquisition of these land use rights during 


2010.”
 19





Absaroka is puzzled about Lihua’s rational for commencing a significant factory expansion prior 


to even completing the basic legal requirement of controlling the land title; this significant risk 


exposure means the Company could potentially lose ownership of the factory and the entire 


investment in any legal dispute over the land.   


Factory Building 


According to a local Danyang construction engineering head who is currently supervising a 


3,000-square-meter factory project, the average building cost for pressed steel cladding, 


concrete pylons, roof, and a concrete factory floor is 700-800 RMB per square meter.  


Absaroka’s in-country investigators separately confirmed with the Danyang Investment

Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 15 
 


Promotion Bureau that the average cost for such a factory in the region is around 800 RMB per 


square meter. Therefore, Absaroka estimates that the expansion for the three factory buildings, 


each at 80x200 meters, would cost approximately 38.4mm RMB ($5.9mm USD).  


Lihua claims the factory building cost will be almost double that, at $10.0mm USD.   Moreover, 


during the site visit, it was the opinion of Absaroka’s in-country investigator that the 


construction materials and workmanship were generally low-quality relative to other local 


factories. 


Factory Equipment 


Absaroka’s in-country investigators interviewed an industry expert who is the Chief Engineer at 


Nanjing Yongliang Furnace Company, which produces metal smelting equipment for Chinese 


manufacturers.  Based on the Chief Engineer’s experience and knowledge, the new 


construction of a complete 25,000-ton copper smelting production line and associated tooling 


would cost approximately 15-20mm RMB. Thus, Absaroka believes the total cost of two 25,000-


ton copper smelting production lines would be at maximum 40mm RMB ($6.2mm USD), which 


accounts for less than 41% of the claimed factory equipment investment of $15.0mm USD.
Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 16 
 


6.   Scrap Import License – Limited opportunity for value creation 
Since the end of FY10, Lihua has pitched to investors that it was pursuing a “Scrap Copper Import 


License” to enable the Company to purchase and import scrap copper directly from overseas 


suppliers.  On 06/22/11, Lihua finally announced receipt of the Environmental Import License from 


the Ministry of Environmental Protection of the People's Republic of China and that the Company 


expects to ramp up its scrap copper imports to material volume by the end of 2011.  Based on 


representations of Lihua Management, investors might have considered this announcement to be 


an important milestone for the Company. 


However, based on Absaroka’s in-country investigation, this announcement would be best classified 


as “fluff,” as a Scrap Copper Import License is not difficult to obtain in the PRC.  While the approval 


process can be slow (like most governmental processes in the PRC), a majority of applicants are 


eventually approved.  For example, in 2010, approximately 950 PRC domiciled companies applied 


for a Scrap Copper Import License and nearly 500 firms were granted licenses.
20





Absaroka believes the Scrap Copper Import License will at best provide de minimis value creation 


for public shareholders because of the limited cost savings, increased working capital requirements, 


and significant scrap sourcing competition.  First, if Lihua was able to decrease its copper anode 


cost of goods sold line-item by $150/ton via sourcing its own scrap copper input, its consolidated 


net income would only increase approximately 3.5% based on FY10 figures (assuming a 25% 


marginal income tax rate).
21


  Next, because of the long lead 


time to import scrap copper (i.e. the shipping time for copper 


to sail across the Pacific to the PRC), Lihua will likely tie up a 


significant amount of working capital as it must prepay for 


the scrap on an FOB basis and structure the trade to avoid the 


significant commodity price risk between scrap purchase and 


anode sale.  Finally, the global scrap metal market has gotten 


considerably more competitive in the last few months, as 


significantly larger and more experienced companies than 


Lihua have dramatically increased their usage of scrap in the 


face of rising copper concentrate prices.
22


  This dramatic 


increase in demand has crushed the price differential 


between copper scrap and copper futures, thus making it 


even more difficult for Lihua shareholders to benefit from the 


Company’s new import license.

A history of low quality auditors has unfortunately been a hallmark of recent Chinese listing frauds.  


Moreover, it appears some auditors have belatedly begun to perform enhanced audit procedures 


on Chinese listings with a fiscal year-end of March 31
st


 or later after a number of auditors were 


burned earlier in the year by companies with December 31
st


 fiscal year ends.   Thus, it seems 


prudent for investors to rigorously assess their belief about Lihua’s ability to successfully complete 


an enhanced fiscal year-end audit process based on the concerns Absaroka has raised earlier in this 


report.

8.   Excessive Stock Promotion – Management appears uniquely focused 


on stock promotion 
Lihua Management has devoted significant resources to the excessive promotion of the 


Company’s equity to potential investors. For example, in 2011 alone, Lihua has presented at 


over 11 significant investor events to date, including: 


Date Event 


07/19/2011 Global Hunter Securities Energy, Metals & Mining and China Conference 


06/28/2011 Brean Murray, Carret & Co Beijing China Growth Conference 


06/01/2011 Cowen and Company Technology Media & Telecom Conference 


05/24/2011 Investor and Analyst Day at Danyang Facility 


05/19/2011 Oppenheimer & Co. China Dragon Conference 


05/17/2011 Piper Jaffrey China Growth Conference

03/16/2011 Roth Capital Partners OC Growth Stock Conference 


03/09/2011 FY10 Earnings Release Conference Call 


03/07/2011 Rodman & Renshaw Annual China Investment Conference 





With an investor relations schedule this rigorous, there is little doubt that Lihua Management is 


doing all they can to “get the story out.”  Any institutional asset manager, hedge fund, or 


investor interested in this space has undoubtedly been exposed to Lihua. Yet the common 


equity still trades at less than 5.0x LTM earnings.  In Absaroka’s opinion, it is no coincidence 


that many institutional investors have decided against investing in Lihua’s stock.
Lihua International, Inc.  (NASDAQ: LIWA)  Page 19 
 


Lihua Estimated Fundamental Value 


$/Share Equity Valuation Metrics30 


Absaroka’s valuation calculations assume 30.0mm diluted shares outstanding and a current net 


cash position of $88.4mm, as per Lihua’s 03/31/11 10-Q SEC filing.  Because of the numerous 


concerns discussed earlier in this document, Absaroka has limited confidence in Lihua’s 


reported financials.  As Lihua’s British Virgin Islands domiciled intermediate holding company, 


Ally Profits Investment Holdings, restricts public investors’ recourse with Lihua’s Management 


to pursue legal damages, the best hope of recovery lies in the liquidation of the net property, 


plant, and equipment and the distribution of cash purportedly on the balance sheet.  As Lihua 


Management appears to have massively overpaid for the new smelter lines, Absaroka is 


concerned that similar malfeasance has occurred in the acquisition of other property, plant, 


and equipment, and has thus has valued the net PP&E at 0.75x-1.00x the reported figure as of 


the 03/31/11 10-Q.  Finally, to be clear, this valuation is predicated on the assumption that the 


$90.7mm cash figure as of the 03/31/11 10-Q accurately reflects the current cash balance; any 


reduction in actual cash balance would cause Absaroka to materially reassess this Estimated 


Fundamental Value calculation. 


Also, because of Lihua’s issues discussed earlier in this report, Absaroka believes there is a 


material risk of NASDAQ enacting a trading halt while these issues are resolved and more 


information is provided.  As the recent LFT/DGW/PUDA/UTA/WATG situations have shown, a 


trading halt can have a significant duration while these critical issues are resolved. 


Triangulating all the information discussed earlier in the report, the recent trading history, and 


reasonable valuation metrics, Absaroka is initiating coverage of Lihua International, Inc. with a 


$3.00/share Estimated Fundamental Value and a CONVICTION SELL Recommendation.

Conclusion – Lihua International, Inc. 
(NASDAQ: LIWA) 


In this Initiating Coverage Report, Absaroka provided compelling evidence that indicates Lihua 


has materially misrepresented its business to investors and thus is significantly overvalued.  


After the numerous fraud-related implosions of Chinese companies listed in North America in 


the last 12 months, investors should exercise extreme caution when investing in the space.  


Absaroka’s main concerns about Lihua include the following material issues: 


1. Self-Dealing and Related Party Transactions – Overlapping Danyang Huaying Resource 


Recycling, Ltd. ownership raises significant concerns about Management motivations 


2. Illogical Financial Results – Unsustainable margins or indicative of accounting 


shenanigans and corporate malfeasance? 


3. Supplier Relationships – Difficult to reconcile public claims with business reality  


4. Illogical and Repeated Secondary Share Issuances – Is the cash balance real? 


5. Implausibly Large Asset Costs – Management appears to be misallocating CAPEX spend 


based on market comparables  


6. Scrap Import License – Limited opportunity for value creation due to increased sourcing 


competition, volatile commodity prices, and significant working capital requirements 


7. Auditors Track Record – Raises significant concerns about the validity of published 


financials and future business prospects  


8. Excessive Stock Promotion – Management appears uniquely focused on stock 


promotion as it has hosted 11 significant investor events YTD 


Any of these serious issues on a stand-alone basis should be enough to convince public 


shareholders to question the current $6.75/share valuation and pursue the “Wall Street Walk” 


form of shareholder activism. 





Recommendation:  CONVICTION SELL
