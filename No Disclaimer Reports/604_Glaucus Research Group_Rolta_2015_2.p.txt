COMPANY:  Rolta India Limited 


INVESTMENT IDEA:  Short Delaware Issued 2018 and 2019 Corporate Bonds 


On April 16, 2015, we published a detailed investment opinion (the “Report”) on the 2018 and 2019 US$ bonds (the “Junk Bonds”) 


issued by the Delaware subsidiary of Rolta India Limited (“Rolta” or the “Company”).  In our Report, we presented extensive analysis 


and evidence, which in our opinion, indicate that Rolta has fabricated its reported capital expenditures in order to mask that it has 


materially overstated its EBITDA.   


On April 20, 2015, Rolta issued a response (the “Response”) which not only materially contradicted previous statements by the Company 


(including statements in its 2013 and 2014 bond prospectuses), but was also muddled, riddled with factual errors and deliberately evasive.  


Any bondholder who critically read our Report and the Response should conclude that Rolta has only dug itself deeper into the hole.     


Rolta begins its Response with an attempt to undermine our credibility on the grounds that we are biased, because we have a short interest 


in the Junk Bonds.  We freely admit our bias.  But it is laughable for Rolta to call into question the power of our analysis on the grounds 


of self-interest when Rolta has an even greater self-interest in the success of its bond issuance and its continued access to foreign capital 


markets.  As we will see, such dishonest, logically-deficient, hyper-defensive accusations are typical of Rolta and its limp attempt to 


distract bondholders and ratings agencies from the evidence and analysis contained in our Report.   


 Authentic Capital Expenditures Should be Reasonably Foreseeable.  Rolta responded that capital expenditures routinely 


exceeded guidance because such guidance did not include acquisitions and foreign currency fluctuations.  Such excuses are 


nonsense. Every year (FYs 2011-2014), Rolta’s annual capital expenditures exceeded the Company’s guidance for spending in 


Q1 or Q2 by an annual average of 208%, even after we remove the effect of acquisitions (which are minimal).  If such capital 


investments are legitimate, they should be reasonably foreseeable.  If they are fabricated, guidance would be useless 


because such reported expenditures are simply concocted at year end to offset dubious EBITDA reported by the business.   


 Rolta’s Returns on Capital Investment are Abysmal.  On both an absolute and relative basis, Rolta does not report 


meaningful returns from its high levels of capital spending.  Its fixed asset turnover from FYs 2012-2014 was an abysmal 0.7x.  


Rolta’s returns are so poor that it creates a reasonable suspicion that its capital expenditures are not authentic.   


o The Response attempted to distract investors from such figures, by offering a ‘peer’ group which included a power 


utility, a manufacturer of ships and submarines and a maker of telecom equipment, whose businesses are nothing like 


Rolta’s.  The only peer offered by Rolta in the IT solutions space was Hexagon, but Rolta appears to have deliberately 


manipulated the calculation of Hexagon’s fixed asset turnover ratio (by including intangibles assets) to make it appear 


(falsely) that Hexagon was as bad as Rolta at capital investments.  Calculated properly, we estimate that Rolta fixed 


asset turnover ratio is actually 92% less than Hexagon’s.  Such deceptive tactics are a massive red flags to 


bondholders, and only underscore the point that compared to other IT solutions firms, Rolta receives almost nothing for 


its substantial capital expenditures.    





 INR 5.6 billion is Missing.  We questioned the authenticity of Rolta’s reported capital expenditures on buildings.  Rolta 


responded with a list of projects that supposedly accounted for the spending.  Yet in FYs 2012 and 2013, Rolta reportedly spent 


INR 6.6 billion on buildings, and according to Rolta’s Response, the only active project during those years was the demolition 


and rebuilding of Rolta Tower 1.  But on Rolta’s FY 2011 conference call, its CFO said that the Rolta Tower 1 redevelopment 


would only cost INR 1 billion, meaning INR 5.6 billion is missing and not accounted for.  Rolta’s numbers fail to add up.  


Again.

Rolta                                                             www.glaucusresearch.com 


 Questionable Authenticity of Capital Expenditures.  Rolta buys computer systems only to depreciate and dispose of them shortly 
thereafter for an almost total loss.  Rolta claims that its 2-6 year depreciation schedule is reasonable, but fails to address evidence 


that Rolta appears to have fully depreciated disposed systems on an even quicker timeline (1 year in some cases).   


o Rolta’s response to this point was disingenuous.  Shockingly, Rolta claimed that it even “made a profit” on the sale of 
computer systems in 3 out of 7 years.  This is an accounting gimmick of the highest order.  Rolta claims either a small loss 


or even a ‘profit’ because it sold the equipment at or near its carried book value.  But in reality, the cash loss (the true 


economic loss) is simply recognized not upon sale but on the income statement in the form of a non-recurring depreciation 


charge.  In reality, for almost no returns, Rolta has incurred a cash loss of INR 25 billion since 2008 from buying computer 


systems, then aggressively and quickly depreciating their value before disposing of them for next to nothing.  This suggests (in 


our opinion) that such expenditures are not authentic.     


o Most Egregious Example.  In FY 2013, Rolta appears to have fully depreciated computer systems that it purchased new in FY 
2012 for INR 5.8bn (US$ 108.1 mm) and disposed of them for INR 12.2 million (US$ 222,000).  How does US$ 108 million 


of computer systems become almost worthless in one year?  Why were they apparently depreciated ahead of schedule?   


o If such purchases were authentic, why has Rolta (again) failed to provide any additional information on these expenditures?  
From whom did Rolta purchase INR 31 billion (US$ 594 mm) on computer systems from FYs 2011-2014?  What exactly 


did Rolta buy? Why were such systems disposed of so quickly?  To whom were they disposed?  





 Questionable Utility.  Rolta spent 45 times more than other leading IT solutions companies on computer systems, suggesting that 
Rolta’s reported capital expenditures are unnecessary and unreasonable when compared to other leading IT firms.  Rolta justified 


such expenditures on the grounds that it is an IT company.  This misses the point.  The question is not why an IT firm needs to buy 


computer systems, but why Rolta spent 45times more than other leading IT companies on them.      


o Rolta’s balance of furniture and fixtures per employee is US$ 10,492 (gross), which is 7.1x greater than Google’s (also on a 
gross basis).  Rolta’s reported spending so far exceeds other technology companies and the bounds of reasonableness that in 


our opinion they appear fabricated.  Rolta falsely accused us of comparing its gross figures to net figures from Google.  Rolta 


is mistaken (again).  We included snapshots of the balance sheets in Annex I of this Rebuttal which show that our calculation 


is correct.  





 Phantom Prototypes.  In our Report, we questioned the legitimacy of Rolta’s claimed US$ 139.4 million in expenditures on 
prototypes in FY 2014, when it appears that prototypes for Rolta’s two most salient prospective contracts would cost (at a 


maximum) only US$ 23.4 million.  The response was surreal.   


o Rolta responded that in fact it did not spend US$ 139.4 million on prototypes in 2014, rather this sum represented total capital 
investments.  This materially contradicts previous statements by Rolta in both the 2014 bond prospectus and the 2014 


annual report, which unambiguously state that Rolta spent US$ 139.4 million on prototypes (we have the excerpts to prove 


it).  That Rolta asks bondholders to disregard the plain reading of its MD&A suggests that the Company is not to be trusted. 


o Rolta attempts to distract bondholders by claiming large capital expenditures on prototypes.  Yet this materially contradicts 
the Company’s previous statement, in which a Rolta executive said on the Q1 2015 conference call that Rolta’s most 


salient and (presumably) lucrative prospective contract (the BMS contract) would require “hardly any capital expenditures” 


because the Indian government pays such costs.    


o Furthermore, if capital investments went to prototypes, what prototypes has Rolta actually built? For which projects? How 
much did such prototypes cost? That Rolta failed, in its Response, to provide any measure of detail on its supposed capital 


investments should scare any investor examining the long term viability of the Junk Bonds.   





 Gurgaon Facility.  In our Report, we noted that Rolta spent INR 1.5 billion (US$ 31 million) on a facility owned privately by the 
Chairman.  The Company does not deny this, but claims that money was spent fitting out two floors leased from the Chairman.  We 


find it hard to believe that Rolta spent INR 1.5 billion fitting out two floors considering it only cost INR 1 billion to demolish and 


rebuild the seven-story Rolta Tower 1.  Just another example of cash disappearing into a black hole of capital expenditures.  





 Chairman’s Murky Compensation Structure.  Our Report questioned how the Chairman could be paid INR 61 million in FY 
2012 when Rolta lost money that year, given that his compensation structure entitles to him to 5% of net profits.  Rolta said our 


facts were wrong, that it did make a profit that year.  Rolta’s consolidated IFRS financial statements (which govern bond covenants 


and which are generally relied up by bondholders) state that Rolta recorded a net loss of INR 959.9 million in FY 2012.  Rolta’s 


response was disingenuous, and highlighted the conflict of interest inherit in a compensation structure that incentivizes paper profits 


under Indian GAAP when the IFRS financial statements clearly show that Rolta lost money.   





 Unfathomable EBITDA Margins.  In our Report, we noted that the standalone EBITDA margins for Rolta’s Indian subsidiary 
(71% in FYs 2013 and 2014) were simply not credible.  Rolta responded that only the consolidated EBITDA margins (35%) could 


be relied upon.  We disagree, but the point may be moot, because even such consolidated margins are not credible.  A group of 


leading IT solutions companies, which are put forth by Rolta in its Response as reasonable comps, show an average EBITDA 


margin of just 19.1%, and no other leading IT solutions firm in this group reported a 35% EBITDA margin in any of the last five 


years.   





We continue to firmly believe that the preponderance of the evidence suggests Rolta has fabricated its reported capital expenditures and 


that both bondholders and ratings agencies have failed to price this evidence into Rolta’s Delaware issued bonds.  We continued to value 


the Junk Bonds at the recovery value of Rolta’s offshore assets, which we estimate to be US$ 0.16 on the dollar.

Rolta                                                             www.glaucusresearch.com 


I. Capital Expenditures Significantly Exceeds Guidance 


Perhaps one of the most damming pieces of evidence in our analysis is Rolta’s pattern of annual capital 


spending which exceeds early quarter guidance.  If such capital investments are legitimate, they should be 


reasonably foreseeable.  If they are fabricated, guidance would be useless because such reported 


expenditures are simply concocted at year end to offset dubious EBITDA reported by the business.  


Evidence suggests the latter.   





For example, in Rolta’s 2013 bond prospectus, the Company stated that its budgeted capital expenditures 


for FY 2013 (ending June) were US$ 200 million, of which Rolta had already spent US$ 143 million as 


of March 2013.
1
  However, in Rolta’s subsequent filings, the Company reported that capital expenditures 


for FY 2013 were US$ 350 million.
2
  In just three months, the Company supposedly spent an additional 


US$ 207 million, more than doubling its capital investment for the year and bringing its total 


expenditures for FY 2013 to 75% over budget.  How could management, in March 2013, not have 


foreseen such large capital expenditures over the next three months?  





Capital investment should be reasonably foreseeable, especially in the near term.  Since FY 2009, Rolta 


has spent an average of 178% more on capital expenditures per year than management guided to analysts 


in Q1 or Q2.  Measured from FY 2011-2014, Rolta has spent 218% more than early guidance.  A 


predictable pattern has emerged: early in each calendar year, Company managers promise analysts and 


bondholders that capital expenditures will come down significantly, only for such expenditures to 


skyrocket in Q3 and Q4.   





In the Response, Rolta claimed that our analysis was incorrect, because acquisition costs were not 


included by management in capital expenditure guidance.  Rolta complains that it “cannot be expected to 


predict the number and value of acquisitions” it makes in a given year.
3
 





This is irrelevant.  In the following table, we compare the Company’s guidance on capital expenditures 


to Rolta’s actual capital expenditures and we remove the effect of acquisitions, which were minimal.  


The same damning pattern is clear.

Without acquisitions, Rolta’s capital expenditures exceeded early quarter guidance by an average of 


168% per year from FY 2009 – 2014.  Measured from FY 2011 – 2014, spending exceeded guidance by 


a staggering 208%! As the following bar chart shows, the damning pattern exists regardless of whether 


we include acquisitions in the calculation.    








In 2013, management guidance in Q1 was INR 3 billion for the year, even though Rolta ended up 


spending INR 16 billion for the year (without considering acquisitions), 433.8% more than management 


told analysts to expect.   





Rolta also tried to blame foreign currency fluctuations on missing guidance, but the impact is negligible.  


If foreign currency fluctuations explained Rolta’s spending pattern, we should expect the variance to go 


both ways:  some years, spending should exceed estimates, other years, vice versa.   





Rolta’s excuses are simply nonsense.  Regardless of acquisitions, the damning pattern holds.  In Rolta’s 


response, and in the commentary of sell-side analysts who function as apologists for the Company, no 


explanation is ever offered for the fact that capital expenditures so consistently and significantly 


exceed guidance.   


In our opinion, this indicates that management is either incompetent and does not remotely understand its 


business or it is simply fabricating capital expenditures in Q3 and Q4 in order to mask overstated 


EBITDA by inappropriately capitalizing costs.  We believe the latter.

II. Rolta’s Return on Capital Investments is Abysmal 


In our Report, we highlighted that from FYs 2008-2014, Rolta spent INR 70 billion (US$ 1.4 bln) on 


capital expenditures and acquisitions, an amount far in excess of the INR 43 billion (US$ 858 mm) in 


EBITDA that the Company supposedly earned over this period.   


Yet the return on such spending has been unquestionably abysmal.  Rolta’s fixed asset turnover ratio (a 


measure of the return on capital investment) is 0.7x (FYs 2012-2014), which is 93% less than an 


average of its putative peers.   





Rolta claimed in its Response that we had “cherry picked” the peer group of 18 leading IT solutions 


companies, which had an average annual fixed asset turnover ratio of 10.1x.  Instead, Rolta offered 4 


“peers” (which supposedly also boasted poor fixed asset turnover ratios), and claimed that its return on 


capital investment was therefore “reasonable.”
4
 





First of all, the Response to this point is unintentionally hilarious.  Rolta dismisses our analysis on the 


basis that the IT companies we selected for a comparison of fixed asset turnover ratios were not a 


reasonable basis of comparison.  


But on the very next page of its Response, Rolta offers a table comparing the estimates of useful lives 


of computer systems by the “leading IT companies” to argue that its own depreciation assumptions are 


reasonable.  Rolta’s depreciation schedule table (unbelievably) includes SIX companies from the peer 


group we identified in our comparison of fixed asset turnover: Infosys, Wipro, TCS, Tech Mahindra, 


Capgemini and Accenture.

Rolta Response, p. 9. 





When the comparisons are not flattering (because Rolta reported fixed asset ratio was 93% less than such 


“leading IT companies” during the period FY 2012-2014), Rolta dismisses our list of comparable 


companies as being misleading.  Yet on the very next page, when it is convenient for the Company, Rolta 


touts many of those same companies as a reasonable basis for comparison. This is just another 


example of the deficient logic (bordering on misrepresentation) employed by Rolta throughout its 


Response.  





Furthermore, Rolta’s “peer” group is ridiculous.  One of “peers” selected for comparison was Tata 


Power, Indian’s largest private utility.  A utility company’s return on assets should be low, because its 


business requires heavy investment infrastructure and power generation, which is paid back slowly over 


time as the firm sells power.  Its business is nothing like Rolta’s.   


The second and third “peers” offered by Rolta are L&T Defense, a defense contractor which builds 


warships and submarines and ITI Ltd, a state-owned manufacturer of telecommunications equipment.  


Building ships and telecommunications equipment is much different that providing IT solutions – as both 


companies invest in large infrastructure projects (ships, telecommunications).  Rolta does not.   


The only “peer” offered by Rolta which appears to have even a remotely similar business to Rolta is 


Hexagon AB (“Hexagon”), which is a global IT solutions company based out of Sweden.   


Here Rolta appears to have intentionally misrepresented Hexagon’s fixed asset turnover ratio to make 


it appear as if Hexagon is as bad at capital investment as Rolta.  In its calculation, Rolta includes 


Hexagon’s intangible assets and other current assets.  This is accounting 101 – when calculating fixed 


asset turnover, such items are inappropriate.   


If we calculate Hexagon’s ratio properly, we estimate that Hexagon’s fixed asset turnover ratio 


average for FY 2012-2014 is 9.8x!  By comparison, Rolta’s ratio is 92% less than Hexagon’s.

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 





Hexagon’s return on capital investment is almost exactly in line with the fixed asset turnover ratio 


(average of 10.3x) that we calculated for other “leading IT companies.”  Examining Hexagon, Rolta’s 


proposed IT solutions peer, only reinforces our point: Rolta’s return on capital investment is so poor (on 


both a relative and absolute basis) that such expenditures appear simply fabricated.   


The peer group originally identified in our Report includes many IT solutions firms operating in India.  


These are businesses which conduct the same or similar business as Rolta, and many of them do so in the 


same market.  Our list even includes Bharat Electronics, which is Rolta’s manufacturing partner in its 


consortium bid for the BMS contract, and which reports a significantly higher asset turnover ratio 


(8.43x) than Rolta (0.7x).
6
    


It is nonsense for Rolta to claim our chosen peer group is unfair when it includes Rolta’s bidding partner 


and other firms which are offered by Rolta as reasonable bases of comparison in the same Response.   


We highlighted Rolta’s dismal return on assets for two reasons.  The first is that Rolta’s return on capital 


expenditures is so far below other IT solutions firms that it suggests Rolta’s reported spending is 


fabricated.  The second reason is that the Company’s fixed asset ratios show that Rolta is getting 


almost nothing in return for the huge amounts of money it spends every year.   


III. INR 5.6 billion is Missing 


In our Report, we noted that Rolta’s reported capital expenditure on buildings is highly suspicious 


because between FYs 2006 and 2014, Rolta claims to have spent INR 12 billion (US$ 241 mm) on 


buildings, yet Rolta did not appear to add any owned real property during that period except for office 


suites acquired in 2009.  This begs the question of whether such capital expenditures were authentic.   


Rolta responded that its capital investment in buildings during this period was allocated to the following 


projects:
7
 


- Rolta Tower 1 which was demolished and rebuilt in FY 2012 and FY 2013 


- Rolta Tower “C” which was demolished and rebuilt in FY 2008 


- SEEPZ SEZ Unit nos. 201-204 completed in FY09; and 


- SEEPZ SEZ Unit nos. 501-504 completed in FY10 


Yet the figures do not even come close to adding up.  In FYs 2012 and FY 2013, Rolta reportedly spent a 


total of INR 6.6 billion on buildings (not fixtures or fittings).
8
  According to Rolta’s Response, the only 


building redevelopment project which took place during those two fiscal years was the demolition and 


reconstruction of Rolta Tower 1. 


But on Rolta’s FY 2011 conference call, Rolta CFO Hiranya Ashar told analysts that the redevelopment 


of Rolta Tower 1 would only cost a total of INR 1 billion.

If only INR 1 billion of building capital expenditures went towards the redevelopment of Rolta Tower 1, 


where did the other INR 5.6 billion go that Rolta supposedly spent on buildings in FYs 2012 and 


2013?  


INR 5.6 billion is missing. Rolta’s Response simply increased the suspicion that its reported capital 


expenditures on buildings were not authentic, because its touted redevelopment projects do not appear to 


come close to accounting for the massive amount of money that the Company claims to have spent.   


IV. Reported Expenditures of Questionable Authenticity and Utility 


Rolta’s reported capital expenditures are deeply suspicious, with much of the reported spending 


disappearing into phantom prototypes and computer systems of questionable authenticity and utility.  


Rolta’s Response did not even attempt to address the Report’s analysis on this topic, but instead 


intentionally misrepresented the Report’s contents to distract from the damning evidence.   


1) Computer Systems 


In our Report, we noted that from FYs 2011-2014, Rolta spent INR 31 billion (US$ 594 mm) on 


computer systems, representing 64% of the Company’s total capital expenditures during this period.  


Suspiciously, Rolta fell into a predictable pattern of acquiring computer systems, quickly depreciating 


them (in some cases faster than its depreciation assumptions should allow), and then disposing of such 


systems at a massive loss shortly after purchase.  





During this period, Rolta disposed of INR 21.1 billion (US$396 mm) of computer systems and in 


exchange received only INR 77.2 million (US$ 1.3 mm). Because Rolta quickly depreciated many 


newly purchased computer systems to zero before disposal, Rolta did not record a loss upon sale on the 


income statement and instead was able to take a non-recurring depreciation charge.   





Rolta attempts in its Response to characterize these losses as small or in certain instances even as profits.  


Rolta claims that between FY 2008 and FY 2014, the Company “made profits in 3 years out of the 7 years 


from such sales.”
9
  Rolta also claims that overall loses on dispositions were only INR 884.2 million, once 


depreciation is taken into account.

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 





This is disingenuous and an accounting gimmick of the highest order.  Rolta buys equipment, then 


aggressively and quickly depreciates its value; and then disposes of it for next to nothing.  Rolta then 


claims either a small loss or even a ‘profit’ because it sold the equipment at or near its carried book value.  


But in reality, the cash loss (the true economic loss) is recognized not upon sale but on the income 


statement in the form of a non-recurring depreciation charge.     





Rolta claims it is reasonable to depreciate computer systems on a 2-6 year schedule and that once 


depreciated, such systems retain little of their original value.  We do not disagree.  The debate is not on 


whether it is reasonable to depreciate computer systems on a 2-6 year schedule or whether they are 


valuable upon disposal, the debate is whether such purchases and subsequent dispositions were authentic.  


We think not.  


One of the reasons that we think such purchases were not authentic is because they were sold or scrapped 


so soon after Rolta purchased the equipment.  By our calculation (assuming a conservative FIFO system), 


Rolta has fully depreciated and disposed of computer equipment which it had purchased the previous 


year, seemingly sooner than its depreciation schedule should allow.

The most egregious example occurred in FY 2013, when Rolta purportedly disposed of INR 16 billion 


(US$ 294.6 mm) of computer systems including INR 4.3 billion (US$ 77.9 mm) of equipment purchased 


in FY 2011 and INR 5.9 billion (US$ 108.1 mm) of equipment that was purchased in FY 2012, the 


previous year. 





Whether such losses are recognized on the income statement or balance sheet, it does not change the fact 


that Rolta has recognized cumulative cash losses of INR 25,548.7 million by engaging in a pattern of 


purchasing, depreciating, then quickly disposing of computer equipment.

Such losses are so staggering that we question the authenticity of the capital expenditures and suspect that 


the function of such dispositions is simply to provide a black hole on paper to mask the overstatement of 


the Company’s EBITDA.  





Another reason that we believe such purchases were not authentic is because on a gross basis, as of FYE 


2014, Rolta balance sheet shows US$ 99,873 (INR 6 million) worth of computer systems per employee, 


which is as least 45 times more than its putative peers (also measured on a gross basis).   





Rolta claims that the above comparison is selective because the Company’s expenditure on computer 


systems is towards the development of R&D prototypes, “which has no connection with computer cost 


per employee.”
10


  Yet our list of peers included a broad range of IT solutions companies, including 5 


“leading IT companies” which Rolta highlighted as a reasonable basis for comparison of the 


depreciation schedule for its computer systems in its Response.
11


  If such firms were a reasonable basis of

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


comparison for the useful lives of computer systems, surely such firms are also a useful basis of 


comparison when comparing the spending on such computer systems.  


Our point was that Rolta has claimed to spend so much on computer systems (45x more than the peer 


group), that the utility of such investments is highly questionable.   


Additionally, if such purchases were authentic, why has Rolta (again) failed to provide any additional 


information on such purchases?  From whom did Rolta purchase INR 31 billion (US$ 594 mm) on 


computer systems from FYs 2011-2014?  What exactly did Rolta buy? Why were such systems 


disposed of so quickly?  To whom were such systems disposed?  


We believe that Rolta’s reported capital expenditures on computer systems are not authentic.  We believe 


this because the Company’s return on such investment is almost non-existent.  We believe this because 


such systems are depreciated and sold or scrapped soon after purchase.  In some case, such equipment is 


sold or scrapped the next year!  And if other “leading IT companies” are any guide, such purchases are 


unnecessary.  Finally, Rolta tells investors nothing about such purchases – from whom it buys, to whom it 


sells, even the nature of what exactly it is purchasing.   


The final piece is of evidence in favor of our opinion is that, conveniently for Rolta, the profits 


supposedly generated by its business are almost all swallowed up in the black hole of spending on 


computer systems – a convenient erosion of profits. 





Source: Company Annual Reports and Bond Prospectuses 


If bondholders believe Rolta’s explanation in its Response, bondholders must ask themselves the 


following question:   


Why does Rolta continue to spend money on such computer equipment, if the value of such 


equipment erodes so quickly and the returns on such equipment are so poor?  If Rolta is to be 


believed, bondholders must believe that Rolta’s management continues to make the same mistake, quarter 


over quarter, year over year.  


Is it more likely that management is so incompetent that it cannot free itself from a cycle of wasting all of 


its profits, time and again, on computer systems that generate almost no returns?  Or is it more likely that 


such expenditures are fabricated, simply invented by management as a bottomless balance sheet pit to 


provide a convenient explanation for why profits supposedly generated by an opaque business model
12 
 


Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 


never seem to find their way to investors and for why a Company that is so consistently and fabulously 


profitable is a serial capital raiser? We believe the latter.   


2) Phantom Prototypes 


In our Report, we noted that in FY 2014, Rolta reported INR 8.4 billion (US$ 139.4 mm) of capital 


expenditures on the development of prototypes for defense and homeland security.   Given that Rolta’s 


maximum future expenditure for the prototypes for its two largest prospective contracts is a combined 


US$ 23.4 million, we are highly suspicious that Rolta spent US$ 139.4 million on prototypes in FY 


2014.  





Rolta’s response was surreal.  The Company argues that the figure we quoted above (US$ 139.4 million) 


represents Rolta’s total capital expenditure for the FY 2014 and not just its expenditures on prototypes 


alone.
12





But this Reponses directly contradicts Rolta’s 2014 bond prospectus, in which the Company 


unambiguously stated how much it supposedly spent on prototypes in that year:   





Source: 2014 Bond Prospectus, p. 70. 


This statement is repeated almost verbatim in Rolta’s 2014 annual report:  








Source: FY14 Annual Report p.160-161 


Both the 2014 bond prospectus and the 2014 annual report are unambiguous.  Both documents clearly 


state that Rolta supposedly spent INR 8.4 billion (US$ 139.4 mm) on “the development of prototypes for 


defense, homeland security and other sectors…” in FY 2014.
13





Yet Rolta rejects this plain reading of its previous statements.  But we are not fooled, and bondholders 


should not be fooled either.

Rolta unambiguously disclosed to investors its reported spending on prototypes.  When we pointed out 


that such figures appeared unlikely, given the limited capital investment required for Rolta’s largest 


prospective contracts which would require prototypes, the Company has backtracked and changed its 


story to suit its current needs.  In doing so, it has essentially told bondholders not to trust its statements in 


the MD&A in the bond prospectus and in its annual report. 


Rolta also argues that we are mistaken in our assumption that the Indian government bears the majority of 


the cost (80%, reportedly) of developing prototypes.
14


  But this also directly contradicts Rolta’s previous 


statements.   


On the Q1 2015 conference call, Rolta unambiguously stated that it would not need significant capital 


expenditures on prototypes for its largest and most salient prospective contract because the 


government pays the vast majority of such costs:  





Source: Q1 2015 Conference Call 


Above, Rolta’s Atul Tayal’s statements directly contradict Rolta’s Response.  He stated unambiguously 


that Rolta would not require significant capital expenditures to develop prototypes for its most salient 


and important prospective contract (the BMS contract) because the government bears such costs.  


Yet in Rolta’s Response, presented with evidence and analysis that its reported capital investment in 


prototypes appears fabricated, the Company now states that such capital investments are indeed necessary 


and such costs are not born by the government.  


Rolta is materially contradicting its previous statements to the market, and is desperately trying to change 


its story in the face of damning evidence that (in our opinion) indicates it has simply made up reported 


capital expenditures on prototypes.  


3) Office Furniture: Ikea be Damned 


In our Report, we noted that perhaps the most absurd line item in Rolta’s capital spending is its reported 


investment in office furniture and fixtures.  As of FYE 2014 (9 months), Rolta’s balance sheet had US$ 


10,493 of furniture and fixtures per employee, which is 7.1x greater than even Google, the Silicon 


Valley giant, which boasts some of the most lavish and renowned corporate facilities of any business.

 Rolta Response, p. 17.

Rolta                                                         www.glaucusresearch.com 





In its Response, Rolta claims that we made an error because we compared Rolta’s gross balance of 


furniture and fixtures with the net figure for Google, Accenture and Wipro.  We didn’t.  Rolta is mistaken 


(again).  Any investor can do the calculation, but for ease of reference we included the snapshots of the 


balance sheet in Annex I. 





Next, Rolta claims that it uses a large number of sub-contractors in its business, which must apparently be 


accommodated on the Company’s premises.   Even though Rolta has 3,500 employees, it claims that it 


invested in furniture and fixtures to accommodate 7,000 persons (to supposedly accommodate on-site 


subcontractors).   





Rolta’s excuse fails to convince.  How many subcontractors did Rolta employ on campus in FY 2014? 


Why does the Company fail to disclose both the number of subcontractors on the premise and the 


duration of their visit?  What firm provides such sub-contractors?  





Furthermore, even if we double the size of Rolta’s workforce (3,500 employees plus 3,500 sub-


contractors), its furniture and fixtures per employee is still 3.5x greater than Google’s and even larger still 


than Accenture or Wipro’s furniture and fixtures balance - and that is assuming that those firms do not 


have similar accommodations for sub-contractors – which they probably do.  Even if Rolta’s excuse is 


taken at face value, its reported capital spending still looks so ridiculous that in our opinion, the simplest 


explanation is that the reported capital expenditures are fabricated.  


V. Gurgaon Facility 


In our Report, we questioned why Rolta incurred capital expenditures to build out a facility owned 


privately by the Chairman, only to lease the facility from Chairman after construction was finished.  


Rolta admits that the Gurgaon building is owned by its Chairman’s private company and justifies the INR 


1.5 billion (US$ 31 mm) expenditure by claiming it was not used to build the facility but was used to fit-


out the two floors that it has leased in the building. 


We have not been able to determine whether this is true, however, but we find it hard to believe that the 


Company managed to spend INR 1.5 billion (US$ 31 million) fitting out just two floors of a building. As 


demonstrated earlier, the redevelopment of Rolta Tower 1, which has seven floors, only cost INR 1 


billion.  


Again, Rolta’s response raises more questions than it answers and provides another worrying example of 


more cash disappearing into a black hole of capital expenditures.

VI. Past is Prologue: 2004 Accounting and Tax Scandals 


In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) concluded that Rolta had inappropriately 


inflated its reported revenues by 12-34% each year from 1996 through 2001, by including the cost of 


capital equipment in its top-line revenue figures.   
 


Rolta claims that it was merely following generally accepted accounting practices in India prior to 2005, 


and that there were a number of mitigating factors identified by SEBI.  In essence, Rolta’s excuse seems 


to be that everyone was doing it and that it was not severely punished, so it is not a big deal.   
 


This misses the point.  In our opinion, the practice of inflating revenue by including capitalized costs does 


not seem like an honest accounting error or a misinterpretation of an accounting standard, regardless of 


whether other companies were following the same practice.  Such a practice seems a deliberate 


manipulative action to artificially inflate a Company’s stock price by overstating reported financial 


performance.   
 


In addition, Rolta may have escaped serious consequences for a host of reasons (including political 


connections), many of which have nothing to do with the severity of its offense.   





We pointed out in our Report that normally, such a scandal in the past may not be noteworthy.  But the 


key difference in this case is that neither the audit committee members nor the auditors who presided over 


the tax and accounting scandals were fired or replaced – they continued to serve the Company in the same 


functions until 2013!  In addition, to our knowledge, neither was any top level executive fired or 


replaced.
15








Consider the following: if an American bond issuer was found to have systemically and inappropriately 


inflated revenues over six-seven years by including the cost of equipment in its top line, would 


bondholders be comfortable without any change of auditor, audit committee members, CFO, or top 


executives?  We think not.   
  


VII. Undisclosed Procurement Scandal. 


In January 2014, a television spot by Headlines Today reported that the Indian Army had begun 


investigation into secret surveillance equipment worth ~300 crore which the army had purchased from 


Rolta.  Headlines Today reported that Col. Sujit Banerjee, an Indian army officer was a key witness in the 
case, was found dead in his hotel room before he was supposed to appear in a special deposition before the 


Army’s court of inquiry regarding the matter.
16








In Rolta’s Response, the Company denies that any investigation was initiated with respect to the January 


2011 allegations of corruption but does not deny that it is (or was) under investigation in the Col. 


Banerjee case.  We have no way of confirming whether the Company is telling the truth, as almost all 


such proceedings are surely classified.   





Ultimately, we highlighted the case because we believe it should have been disclosed to bondholders in 


the 2014 prospectus (and perhaps the 2013 bond prospectus) because if news reports are to be believed, 


this scandal could result in a fine or financial penalty and it could undermine or negatively impact Rolta’s 


eligibility to qualify for or obtain future contracts from the Ministry of Defense or the Indian Army.   





                                                           
15


 CFO V.L. Ganesh resigned in 2006, but there is no indication that he resigned in connection with either the findings of 


accounting misconduct by SEBI nor the allegations of the ITD that Rolta claimed depreciation on fictitious assets to avoid taxes.

Because the Indian government is Rolta’s primary source of revenue, the scandal could have a material impact 
on the Company’s future performance.


17
  Our logic holds. 





VIII. Chairman’s Murky Compensation Structure 
 


In our Report, we noted that the Chairman’s murky compensation structure (he is entitled to 5% of net 


profits of the Company) clearly incentivizes the use of accounting gimmicks to artificially inflate profits 


when the Company’s underlying performance is middling or poor.  We also highlighted that this structure 


seems arbitrarily applied, because in FY 2012, Rolta paid Chairman Singh INR 61 million (US$ 1.2 


mm) even though Rolta reported a net loss for the year. 


Rolta huffed and puffed in its Response that this was a “demonstrative distortion of facts” and a “lack of 


thorough research.”
18


  We think not.  Rolta reported a profit in 2012 under Indian GAAP of INR 2.4 


billion.  But foreign bondholders use the IFRS financial statements, and Rolta’s covenants in the bond 


indentures are measured according to the IFRS financials and not Indian GAAP.   


The Company’s 2012 IFRS consolidated financial statement state that Rolta recorded a net loss from 


operations of INR 959.9 million.   





Source: Rolta 2012 Annual Report, p. 96. 


This dispute about whether Rolta was profitable in 2012 underscores our point. If a Company’s 


consolidated income statement shows INR 2.4 billion of profits under Indian GAAP and a INR 959.9 


million loss under IFRS, then the problem with tying the Chairman’s compensation to net profits is that it

incentivizes the use of accounting gimmicks to boost net profits under Indian GAAP even if the 


underlying performance of the Company is poor when measured by International Financial Reporting 


Standards.   


IX. Reported EBITDA Margins Not Credible 
 


Although Rolta reports consolidated EBITDA margins of ~35%, we noted in our Report that (at least 


according to Rolta’s public filings) Rolta’s North American business operates at a loss, meaning that such 


reported profitability is driven by EBITDA margins from Indian operations which we estimate have 


topped 70% in FYs 2013 and 2014.   





In its Response, Rolta claimed that even though the Company has time and again reported that its offshore 


subsidiaries are not profitable, the distinction between offshore and onshore profitability is not easily 


parsed.   





Rolta urges investors not to consider the EBITDA margins of the standalone Indian business because it 


claims that offshore subsidiaries serve as a loss leader for the Indian parent.  Rolta states that offshore 


entities typically incur SG&A to win a contract, but then enter into a back-to-back contract with the 


Indian entity.  The India entity receives the revenue for the contract and provides the services.  The 


offshore entity supposedly pays the India entity for the work and bears the cost of additional SG&A 


required to win and service the contract.  Thus, the Indian entity is far more profitable than the offshore 


entities, but its standalone 71% EBITDA margin should not be considered in a vacuum.  








 
Rolta Response, p. 29. 





If this were true, and the Indian entity entered into a back-to-back contract with offshore subsidiaries to 


perform services under the contract between the offshore subsidiary and the customer, then significant 


sales should appear between Rolta’s Indian parent and offshore subsidiaries.  They do not.   





The related party sales in the table below are from the related party transaction disclosures of the 


standalone Indian entity taken from Rolta’s annual report – they are a measure of the transactions between 


the Indian parent and its offshore subsidiaries.

Take FY 2014, for which we estimated that the standalone EBITDA margin for Rolta’s Indian business 


was 71%.  Rolta says that our assumption is incorrect, because of the significant transactions from back-


to-back contracts between offshore entities and the Indian parent.  But in 2014, related party sales 


between the offshore subsidiaries (presumably) and the Indian parent accounted for only 2% of the total 


sales reported by such offshore entities.   





If Rolta’s Response was accurate, and the Indian operating entity entered into back-to-back contracts with 


its offshore entities, then we would expect related party sales to be a significant portion of the reported 


sales of offshore entities.  But according to Rolta’s annual reports, this does not appear to be the case.

There is further supporting evidence for our contention.  Rolta’s bond prospectus contains consolidated 


financials of Rolta International Inc., the primary U.S. subsidiary, and its direct American, Canadian and 


Australia operating subsidiaries.  These financial statements break out the transactions between this group 


of offshore entities and Rolta’s Indian parent.  Again, transactions appear minimal.

This supports our original point.  Such minimal related party sales, transactions and services between 


offshore entities and Rolta’s Indian parent suggest little profit sharing between two.  If that is the case, 


then it reinforces our original estimate that such offshore entities were money-losing operations and that 


EBITDA margins of 71% from the Indian business (in FY 2014) are driving Rolta’s consolidated 35% 


EBITDA margins.  71% EBITDA margins from the Indian business are obviously not credible, which is 


probably why Rolta tried so hard in its Response to deny them.  But the dearth of intercompany sales in 


FY 2014 suggest that indeed, Rolta’s reported EBITDA margin for the Indian business is 71% or close 


thereto. 





This may all be a moot point because regardless of how profitability is parsed over international borders, 


Rolta’s consolidated EBITDA margins are, by themselves, so high that they hardly seem credible.   





Comparing Rolta’s EBITDA margins to the companies that Rolta itself proposes as comps on page 9 of 


its Response, any bondholder can see that Rolta’s consolidated EBITDA margins of 35% are 


significantly ahead of its putative peers (average of 19.1%).

Rolta reported an EBITDA margin above 35.0% in three of the last five years.  How is Rolta so 


consistently profitable, when no other leading IT solutions firm in the comparative set selected by 


Rolta reported a 35% EBITDA margin in any of the last five years?   


Do bondholders truly believe that Rolta is a better IT solutions firm than such global standouts such as 


Tata Consulting? Wipro? Accenture? Capgemini?  Is it just a coincidence that such staggering profits are 


“spent” on capital expenditures of dubious authenticity, ensuring that despite supposedly world-class 


EBITDA margins, Rolta is a serial capital raiser?   


Ultimately, we believe that the simplest explanation is usually the truth.  In this case, we continue to 


firmly believe that the preponderance of the evidence suggests Rolta has fabricated its reported capital 


expenditures to mask overstated EBITDA margins, and that both bondholders and ratings agencies have 


failed to price this into Rolta’s Delaware issued bonds.
