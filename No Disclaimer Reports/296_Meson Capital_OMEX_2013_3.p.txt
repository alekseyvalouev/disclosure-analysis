This report is a follow up to our first 66-page report published October 31, 2013 which can
be found at www.omextruth.com.


"Odyssey's cynically deploying a few random nodes of truth to the end of evading
the acknowledgement of an over-arching and regnant truth." -Judge Steven D.
Merryday in the Sept 25, 2013 'Black Swan' ruling against Odyssey


In response to our initial report, OMEX held a conference call November 5th, not
open to general Q&A, where they refuted exactly ZERO of our factual statements


Here, we will expose the public relations techniques used by Greg Stemm to try to
discredit our research by taking our factual statements out of context.


OMEX failed to address our serious questions and management explanations do not hold
up. For example, we include 3 sources indicating that Panamanian locals are not required
to "satisfy regulatory framework" as OMEX has claimed.


OMEX's most recent 10-Q filed November 12th has numerous revisions that we
highlight including that Neptune Minerals, Inc. -- claimed as a source of $108mm of
"off balance sheet value" -- now appears to be insolvent.

Neptune appears to have lost $25mm over the last fiscal year ended June 30, far
greater than "a few million" that OMEX anticipated in their August 10-Q.
As of June 30, 2013, Neptune's total accumulated deficit appears to be $49mm. This
exceeds Neptune's total equity raises, indicating insolvency: we believe NMI is worth
zero.
Despite Neptune still being unable to pay its bills to OMEX, OMEX lent an additional
$500,000 to Neptune during the 3 month period ending Sept 30, 2013.
Further research into the Oceanica mining project also indicates to us this project is
worthless: other claimed "world class" assets have a high failure rate, do not be
deceived by this empty term.


OMEX has delayed its Commodity Shipwreck business to 2H 2014 and we believe
this business is extremely risky


A new 5 word disclosure was added to this 10-Q related to the Mantola recovery effort:
"but no silver was found"


Despite OMEX's record find it the Gairsoppa, even if OMEX books a $20mm profit in Q4
2013, the average net loss per year for 2012-2013 will still exceed $10mm per year.


We believe the "four separate 20th-century shipwrecks" that OMEX touts are likely Nazi
cargo ships and if so, we question how they could possibly have a valid cargo "rights
secured under contract."


We believe these four ships were found in 1997 by a British Company and are in
extremely deep waters that present new technical hurdles.


If you own the stock, you deserve answers more than anyone, so demand them from your
company. As shareholders, management reports to YOU.


Key Questions for OMEX that Shareholders Deserve Answers to:


1. Please explain why one of OMEX's Bahamian subsidiaries appears to have been
created in 1983 with Greg Stemm's name listed? Why are any Bahamian subsidiaries
necessary for OMEX?


2. If the directors listed on DNA are not involved in that entities daily operations, why are
Panamanian directors listed on DNA paperwork and not the true directors?
