Valeant, Salix, sales force and asset sales
Valeant put out a press release today about expansion of sales force for their Salix business: 


Valeant Announces The Initiation Of A Primary Care Sales Force For Xifaxan®
And Relistor®


LAVAL, Quebec, Nov. 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Valeant Pharmaceuticals International,
Inc. (NYSE: VRX and TSX: VRX) ("Valeant") today announced that it has initiated a
significant sales force expansion to focus on potential primary care physician (PCP)
prescribers of Xifaxan for irritable bowel syndrome with diarrhea (IBS-D) and Relistor for
opioid induced constipation (OIC.)  With the launch of the expanded sales force effort
over the coming weeks, the company expects to reach a significant majority of likely
Xifaxan and Oral Relistor primary care prescribers.  The costs of this program were
considered in previously announced guidance for the full year 2016.


"Our goal in building a primary care sales force is to maximize opportunities for Xifaxan
and Relistor to help our products reach full potential. Xifaxan and Relistor are integral to
our gastrointestinal franchise which remains a core asset for future growth potential in
the hands of Valeant," said Joseph C. Papa, chairman and chief executive officer. "With
approximately 70% of IBS-D patients initially presenting with symptoms to a primary
care physician, our dedicated PCP sales force will be better able to reach the patients in
need of IBS-D treatment and in doing so will further advance our mission to improve
people's lives with our healthcare products."


There are several implications. 
 
First the stories that say Valeant is selling Salix are almost certainly false. These stories are
responsible for the stock rising 30 percent recently. 
 
Secondly it puts the acid to the idea that Mike Pearson (Valeant's former CEO) was good at cutting
costs. As this story makes clear Salix had a Primary Care Sales Force when Valeant acquired it.
However they were debating whether to keep it. (Obviously they gutted it and are now being forced to
reinstate it.) 
 
This happened all over Valeant. Lots of businesses are melting ice cubes where the sales force has
been neutered or where drugs have had prices pushed up to levels that create umbrellas under which
competitors will flourish. 
 
Finally they can't sell Salix for anything like what they paid for it (and that was the single most obvious
sale candidate). Other sale candidates will have bigger separation problems. 
 
Debt outstanding is roughly cumulative acquisition cost. This won't wind down nicely. 
 
Indeed bankruptcy looms. Late next year probably. 
 
Long shareholders, by now you ought to be feeling sick. But let me offer a solution: opiates. Just drug
yourself out so you don't feel the pain. 
 
And if you get opiate-induced constipation Salix/Valeant can help you out. That is what Relistor is for. 
 
And now a Primary Care Salesman will visit your doctor and explain the benefits. Mr Papa (Valeant's
CEO) is making sure that happens. 
 
Sure Valeant will charge your insurance company plenty for the drug. But it is for a good cause.
