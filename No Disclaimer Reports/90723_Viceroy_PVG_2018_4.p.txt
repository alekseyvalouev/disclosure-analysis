Pretium’s predictable predicament 
Pretium stock down >10% prior to post-market announcement of material  grade miss.  


JANUARY 10, 2019 – Pretium released the Brucejack Mine’s Q4 2018 production update yesterday after-market, 


and market reaction shows it fell short of expectations. Pretium’s ore grade has predictably fallen since Q2 2018 


by >22%, leading to a miss of Pretium’s H2 low-end gold production guidance of 200,000 ounces. At 11.5g/t, 


Pretium’s head grade is now 30% below feasibility study sampling. 


 
Figure 1 Viceroy Analysis – Pretium 2018 Production 


Per our previous reports, Viceroy believe Pretium’s grades will continue to fall as Pretium appear to be at the 


tail end of extracting high-grade deposits found along the Cleopatra Vein. As a reminder to our readers, we have 


appended this section of our thesis to this note. 


Pretium have attributed their production and grade shortfall on their grade control system, which they state will 


be refined. We believe this is an unnerving excuse, and have provided substantial evidence to support our thesis 


that Pretium is overmining or selectively minng its deposits. 


Production capacity increases of Pretium’s mill will not fix this problem. 


Viceroy was astonished at the >10% PVG stock decline on massive volume on January 8, 2019, prior to any 


annoucement by Pretium. This is likely related to earlier bullish sentiment disseminated by The Globe and Mail, 


who reported Barrick was ‘eyeing’ Pretium: 


 
Figure 2 Extract from ‘Barrick Gold eyeing Canada for acquisition opportunities’ – Globe and Mail – Jan 7, 20191 


We find it highly unlikely that Barrick would consider Pretium as an acquisition given it’s performance and grades 


have fallen well below expectation, and would likely not meet internal IRR criteria. 


Pretium has failed to address in any depth the issues raised in our report including:  


▪ The involvement of SEC-sanctioned fraudster Sima Muroff in the bulk sample program’s milling operations 


▪ The narrowing of drill core spacings as part of the grade control program, the results of which show no 


continuity within the VOK deposit 


▪ Accelerated mine development 


▪ Resignation of key consultants  


▪ Blown-out costs 


We maintain that Pretium is fundamentally overvalued, and see limited value in its current form.

Annexure: Excerpt from Pretium’s Catch-22 Report – Sep 11, 2018 


Mine development acceleration 
Pretium’s appears to be accelerating its mine plan in the face of what we believe to be a failure to find suitable 


high-grade ore to mill. As previously discussed, Pretium’s significant upcoming financing needs provide a strong 


incentive for management to release news of high grades, even if this means accelerating the development of 


Brucejack.   


Pretium’s 2014 Feasibility study outlines the grouping of stopes based on elevation above sea level, the order in 


which they were forecasted to be mined and anticipated output from each zone. 


 
Figure 3 16.4.2 Pre-production development 


 
Figure 4 Life of Mine Production Schedule by Mining Block 


As can be seen from the above figures, the majority of year 1 to 5 ore was projected to come from the VOK 


middle level defined as the sill elevation at the 1200 level. This was not the case.  


Following poor grades, Pretium’s Q4 2017 production update already mentioned moving up from the 1200 level, 


with it accounting for only 25% of mill feed. The rest, presumably, came from the VOK upper level. 


 
Figures 5 & 6 Pretivm Reports Fourth Quarter and Year End 2017 Results
Viceroy Research Group 4 viceroyresearch.org 


This is strange as the VOK middle level contained the largest deposit and was expected to buttress ore 


production for the first 5 years of mine life with a supposed grade of 14.9g/t 


 
Figure 7 Brucejack Mineral Reserves by Mining Block 


Instead, the focus at Brucejack became the development of the VOK upper level. Pretium CEO Joe Ovsenek at 


the Rodman & Renshaw Conference on September 5, 2018: 


“We’re currently mining at between the 1200-meter level and the 1410-meter level, and we’re 


continuing with our ramp development up to the 1500-meter level…and we’re ramping down to the 


900-meter level” 


 
Figure 8 Extract from Pretium Slide Deck – Rodman Conference 2018
Viceroy Research Group 5 viceroyresearch.org 


Of note is the Cleopatra Vein’s presence at 1345 level as clearly mapped in the bulk sample program. We believe 


this is responsible for the company’s sudden grade improvement in Q2 2018 and sudden rush to reach the VOK 


upper level. The VOK middle level obviously yielded poor results and had to be compensated for with a source 


whose mineralization was better understood.  


 
Figure 9 Plan view (1345 level) of bulk sample area 


We put it to investors that: 


1. The company is selectively mining stopes to provide the street with the grades required to continue the 


Brucejack illusion. 


2. Pretium has a poor understanding of the mineral resource at Brucejack, with recent improvements in 


grade due to the company mining the only portion of the VOK zone it appears to understand. 


Importantly, the rapid development of Pretium’s mine corroborates evidence of overmining. The catch 22 here 


is that, if investors choose to accept overmining does not exist, we believe it is evident that the company has 


been selectively mining for high-grade ore by accelerating region development by 18-24 months. This thesis 


would be supported by excess dore being produced at Pretium’s mill – discussed below. 


Dore/Concentrate mismatch 
Brucejack is producing far more dore relative to concentrate than originally planned. We do not believe this is a 


happy surprise but a product of selective stoping which would throw out the balance of dore-to-concentrate 


produced. Dore is a semi-pure alloy of gold and silver, produced from nuggety veins.  


The 2014 feasibility study outlines the expected ratio of dore-to-concentrate produced for the lifetime of the 


Brucejack mine. These assumptions already assume a forward loading of the mine’s output as laid out earlier in 


the 2014 feasibility study.
Viceroy Research Group 6 viceroyresearch.org 


While year 1 and 2 were projected to have higher dore percentages, this was only 1 percentage point above the 


LOM average: 


 
Figure 10 Projected Gold and Silver Production 


Pretium has actually been producing is 50% more dore relative to forecasts: 


 
Figure 11 Viceroy Analysis 


This anomaly was corroborated by Pretium CEO Joe Ovsenek at the Rodman & Renshaw 20th Annual Global 


Investment Conference on September 5, 2018. 


“…we get about two-thirds of our gold out in dore, and one third out in flotation concentrate” 


As far as we have been able to ascertain, management has not attempted to explain these differences between 


its forecast and actual dore output. We believe this deviation is due to the excessive mining of the Cleopatra 


vein which appears to have been occurring since at least Q3 2017.

Note that this does not debunk the evidence that volume extracted from the mine far exceeds managements’ 


disclosures. Excess mining will allow for selective milling of high grade stock. This is corroborated by evidence 


above and newly presented evidence showing excess stockpiling at the Pretium site: 


Increase in PAG waste time-on surface. 
Since 2015, Brucejack mine has requested several extensions for the amount of time it can keep potentially acid-


generating (PAG) rock stockpiled. For clarity all ore and waste rock from the Brucejack mine is classified as PAG. 


 
Figure 12 20.1.4 Acid Rock Drainage/Metal Leaching 


The period PAG waste was allowed to spend at surface increased from 6 months to 24 months from July 2015 


to March 2017, partially due to a failure of the waste rock dump slope in October 2015. 


 
Figure 13 Brucejack Mine Permit dated July 22, 20152 


 
Figure 14 Operation, Maintenance and Surveillance Manual: Brucejack Gold Mine dated March 20173 


We believe this increase in time is due to the increased excavation at Brucejack mine which is outpacing the 


company’s ability to dispose it into Brucejack lake. Development at the mine shows no signs of slowing from the 


700m/month pace set by management and as such we believe Pretium requested this increased allowance to 


facilitate its overmining and development needs. 


Management attributes this excess waste issue to excess fine material present in the rock. Every consultant we 


have spoken to has advised that this is a non-issue – addition of a further telescopic conveyer if this was the sole 


issue. We opine that the issue is likely excess volume. 


This is further evidence that the rate of mining and development at Brucejack mine far exceeds the design of 


the mine site, given that as far back as 2015 it was clear that Pretium lacked the correct equipment to dispose 


of waste ore. 


Simply put, should be mine be operating at expected capacity/volume, there should not 


have been any excess waste, and no need to seek permission to hold this excess waste for 


an extended period of time.
