CHINA BIOTICS
(NASDAQ:CHBT) — WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED LAST
WEEK


C’mon, not anther story on the Chinese RTO
market!  Sheesh!


These stories have been �ogged to death by the
media and anyone who buys these stocks now
knows it is a caveat emptor market.  Yet last week
the tables turned.  For the �rst time, mainstream
Chinese media started to pick up on the world of
fraud that exists in many of the Chinese based
companies with US listings….and the �rst poster
child was China Biotics.


On January 16th, an independent Chinese blogger
Xia Cao (pen name), produced a post calling into
question various aspects of the company’s
accounting and tax reporting.


But Xai Cao is no ordinary blogger.  What
distinguishes his work is that he teaches at
Shanghai National Accounting Institute and has
developed quite a reputation for exposing �nancial
fraud in China.  In fact, of the 125 companies the
Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission has
pressed charges against; Xia Cao was the �rst to
challenge 25 of them – an astonishing 20% of the
total number….a number that makes Citron jealous.

Then, on January 21st, the story was picked up by
the mainstream press, who took the story to
another level.  The China Biotics saga was written
about by Yicai First Financial Newspaper in China
with the headline


“China Biotics suspected of in�ating �nancial
performance: the number of branded stores
became a myth”


This writer became the �rst entity to speak to
customers, employees, and the company itself on
an independent basis.  This is something that no
blogger, analyst, or journalist had ever done in the
past.  But more importantly, it wasn’t just any
newspaper, either.  Yicai’s First Financial is the
equivalent of the Wall Street Journal and China’s
oldest �nancial paper. More importantly, it carries
the imprimatur of the Chinese Government:

It is Citron’s opinion that if an article comparable to
this had been published by the Wall Street Journal
on a US publicly-traded company, it would be
halted for trading.


So What Did the Company Do?
They couldn’t possibly refute the writer’s story,
because in China, he is of a very strong reputation. 
And to refute the newspaper is to refute a state
controlled entity, so they did what they’ve always
done – turned in another quarter of “perfect”
numbers and raised guidance.


They’ve now constructed a large manufacturing
plant….and that is it.  This is the Field of Dreams. 
Their stores don’t check out, their “distribution
chain” doesn’t check out, and their “major
customers” don’t check out.


Investors are left to believe either the company’s
statements or to conclude that the company has
produced a �ctional narrative of its last �ve years,
of an order of magnitude larger than reality.


This peculiar situation forces the auditor to actually
perform an audit.


Past, Present, and Future
Anyone with a rational thought can agree that the
past of CHBT is murky at best.  Now the Chinese
media has given us a fair glimpse of the present of
CHBT…your only hope is the future.  Unfortunately,
in the publically traded markets you cannot escape
your past and if fraudulent, all �lings will have to be
amended.  Now that is has become mainstream
Chinese news, you can be guaranteed that that
Chinese based auditors cannot turn a blind eye,
especially when Xai Cao questions the cash in the
bank, past earnings, and more importantly the
taxes owed.


“If you tell the truth, you don’t have to remember
anything.” — Mark Twain


It appears to Citron that the company has spun so
many lies in the past that it will become impossible

to cover them up in the future to an audit or the
scrutiny of local media.  One that we �nd the
funniest comes from their last 10Q when they state,


“As of September 30, 2010, we had a total of 447
employees, compared with 415 as of September 30,
2009.”


Yet, this is after they closed the majority of their
stores, which employed over 200 people.  This is
just one of MANY inconsistencies that riddle their
�lings.


What is the SEC doing about this?
With no jurisdiction to enforce anything inside
China, the SEC’s new Chinese Reverse Merger task
force has taken the strategy of looking to US parties
playing supporting roles in propping up fraudulent
companies trading in the US and operating in
China.  Thus, auditors, underwriters, and of course
promoters are going to be held accountable for
fraudulent misrepresentations made in the US
markets.


Conclusion 
We are pleased that the mainstream Chinese press
has started to cover the RTO market.  The fact that
CHBT was the �rst of the exposes will put additional
pressure on the auditor not to turn a blind eye to
the blatant misstatements in the reported �nancials
of China Biotics.
