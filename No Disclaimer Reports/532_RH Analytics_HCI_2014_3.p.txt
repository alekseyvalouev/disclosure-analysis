HCI Group: The Wizards Of Tampa, Part II

by: RH Analytics


Summary


In the second piece in a multi-part series on the HCI group we focus on financial
analysis.


State subsidies embedded in takeouts can be substantial. However, the impact is
temporary and eventually the economics of the underlying policies emerge.


Our analysis shows that HIC's business model is only marginally profitable absent
assumptions, even in the current 'best of times' business environment for DFIs.


Expense analysis indicates that a large portion of the subsidies go out the door in
the form of management compensation, rather than being retained to build the
surplus.


Without a transaction to fortify financial results, going forward we expect policy
erosion, price declines and negative operating leverage to drive the ROE down to
single digits.


Introduction


This is the second of a multi-part series of RH Analytics' short thesis on the HCI Group
(NYSE:HCI). In it, we outline why we believe the company's business model is deeply
flawed and the stock significantly overvalued.


In our first piece on HCI, we provided an overview of the Florida homeowners insurance
market and the context that gave rise to takeout companies such as HCI. We then
compared HCI's business model to peers to illustrate how terms surrounding assumptions
from Citizens combined with several company specific policies make HCI appear more
profitable than the group. At the same time, the underlying economics of Citizens policies
suggest that the takeout model is only marginally profitable under the best of business
conditions.


In this piece, we focus on financial analysis of HCI's business model. We start by
illustrating how assumptions impact the P&L. The transfer of policies and cash without
associated cost structures or liabilities serve as de facto subsidies. Consequently, HCI

appears very profitable for a short period following the assumption. However, the benefits
of the assumption are temporary and the underlying economics of the policies surface in
the absence of a transaction.


To illustrate the underlying economics of HCI's book, we examine company performance
in the largely assumption free period from 4Q2010 to 3Q2011. Financial results at that
time were characterized by churn, escalating costs and collapsing operating margins.
During the same period, the statutory insurance company experienced deepening
underwriting losses as HCI's unsubsidized book 'matured', causing rapid surplus erosion.
Without subsidies, HCI's business model proved grim. The company's downward spiral
was halted with the acquisition of the failed Homewise Insurance in 3Q11. HCI was
effectively recapitalized with a massive transfer of $43.5M from Citizens in connection with
the acquisition.


We generate pro-forma results for 2013 by normalizing reinsurance costs and applying a
more appropriate loss ratio. The pro-forma results show that the business model is much
less profitable than commonly supposed; they also suggest that a significant portion of the
state subsidy is being redirected from the company toward HCI management in the form
of compensation.


HCI's business model is becoming more problematic as time passes. Efforts to make the
company appear more profitable have come at the cost of cash flow. HCI is an earnings
rich, but cash flow poor company - yet another troubling sign lurking below the sheen of
an impressive P&L.


The Florida homeowner's insurance market is not providing HCI and other takeout
companies with a 'free lunch' of easy profits. Citizens subsidizes assumptions because the
policies are mispriced relative to the risk of claims, something the industry has widely
acknowledged. When the highly profitable subsidized period following assumptions end
the underlying economics of the policies emerges. As we illustrate, excluding subsidies,
HCI's underwriting model does not generate 29% pre-tax margins as it did in 2013; rather,
as our pro-forma estimates indicate, we believe the natural pre-tax margin is closer to 2%
even without a major catastropic event.


HCI's 40% ROE has been a key attraction for investors and a driver of the lofty 2.4x book
valuation. However, ROE is set to decline dramatically. We believe that the company will
not make an assumption in 2014. Consequently, policy churn, price declines and negative
sticky operating expenses will cause returns to erode. We estimate that by 1Q15, ROE will

wither from currently industry leading levels of to 7%-15%. Return erosion should continue
as HCI's book ages and negative operating leverage begins to take a bigger bite of
income.


The Real Oz


1. The Financial Impact of a Takeout


Examining HCI's financial statements at the time of an assumption illuminates how the
takeout reshapes the company's operating metrics. The table below shows summary
financial around the 4Q12 policy assumption from Citizens.


HCI 4Q12 Assumption Analysis


Source: Company filings and estimates.


As indicated, both the number of policies and the total value of exposure grew
approximately 50% on a quarter-over-quarter basis with the assumption. Gross premiums
earned increased by 36% over the same period. Reinsurance costs were virtually
5/22/2018 HCI Group: The Wizards Of Tampa, Part II - HCI Group, Inc. (NYSE:HCI) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/2504335-hci-group-the-wizards-of-tampa-part-ii 4/15


unchanged despite the increase in exposure. As a result of flat reinsurance costs, the
entire $18.9M increase in gross premiums flowed down to the net premium line, which
grew 62% quarter-over-quarter. Losses expenses were up marginally quarter-over-
quarter. However, operating expenses grew at a 24%, even though policy acquisition
costs declined. This likely reflects higher compensation; for the full year 2012, increases in
compensation accounted for 82% of the total increase in other expenses. Underwriting
income grew $15.4M or 360% sequentially as $15.3M of the $19M increase in gross
premiums flowed down to the pre-tax operating line.


Examining the expense lines as a percentage of gross premiums illustrates how the
subsidies drove expense ratios down. Reinsurance ceded as a percentage of gross
premiums declined from 42% in 3Q12 to 31% in 4Q12, reflecting the ability to carry the
assumed exposure reinsurance free. Losses and LAE declined from 28% in 3Q12 to 22%
and 19%, in 4Q12 and 1Q13, respectively as the assumption of liability-free premiums
diluted the flat loss expense. Policy acquisition costs also decreased, as expected. The
lower costs conveyed with the assumption allowed the total expense ratio to decline from
92% in 3Q12 to 73% and 61% in 4Q12 and 1Q13, respectively.


The result of the radically reduced cost structure is that operating income skyrocketed
from 8% of gross premiums in 3Q12 to 27% in the following quarter. Similarly, cash flow
from operations increased over 400% to $68.9M from $13.3M with the cash transfer of
unearned premiums from Citizens.


The cash infusion is a key element of the state subsidy, in our view, and represents a
substantial transfer of wealth from the state to HCI.


2. Performance without Assumptions - On the Road to Bankruptcy 2010/2011


HCI's yearly assumptions from 2011-2013 have allowed the company to maintain the
inflated P&L of a subsidized takeout company. The realities of the underlying book are
illuminated when a period without a significant assumption is reviewed.


In 2010 HCI assumed only 8,000 policies from Citizens in the fourth quarter. That
represented fewer than 10% of the total policy count at the end of the year and did not
impact the financial statements significantly. The high churn rate of the takeout business
becomes very visible under the no assumption scenario.


High Churn Policy Base

Source: FlOIR and estimates.


Between 3Q10 and 3Q11, HCI lost 1,623 policies for a net decline of -2.8% despite the
8,031 policy assumption in 4Q10. Removing the assumption policies reveals the natural
dynamics of the book. Total policies would have declined approximately 9,654, -16.4%
during the period. HCI's financial performance began to erode along with the policy base.


The table below details HCI's GAAP financial performance with and without an
assumption. The 2009 financial results reflect the profitability associated with a large
takeout. The four quarter period from 4Q10 to 3Q11 reflects the longer-term, underlying
economics of HCI's book of business and illustrates how the cost structure increases as
the benefits of the assumption pass.

Premiums ceded for reinsurance increased from 41% in 2009 to 49% in 1Q10 and an
average of 46% over the entire period amid falling reinsurance prices. Reinsurance
expenses from 4Q10-2Q11 reflect prices negotiated in 2Q10. The lower cost in 3Q11
reflects the prices of the 2011-2012 program, which was negotiated in 2Q11 and came into
effect in 3Q11.


Losses and LAE expenses increased to 33%-34% in 1Q11-3Q11, but were stable at 32%
of gross premiums earned over the 4Q10-3Q11 period. However, as a percentage of net
premiums earned, the loss ratio increased to 59% from 54% reflecting the higher
reinsurance costs.


We suspect the results at the time were also hampered by wind mitigation credits, which
reduced premiums for some policyholders. In 2011, Governor Rick Scott signed legislation
that limited the credits.


Policy acquisition and underwriting expenses increased from 9% in 2009 to 12% in the
4Q10-3Q11 period. The total expense ratio increased substantially from 86.6% for 2009 to
97.4% in 4Q10-3Q11.


The lack of assumption subsidies and the subsequent increase in cost structure caused
underwriting income margins to collapse from 13.4% in 2009 to 2.6% for the 4Q10-3Q11
period.

The 2009 cash flow is not suitable for comparative purposes with the assumption free
period. The 4Q09 assumption increased receivables that flowed into the company in the
next several quarters, which we do not show on our exhibit. To illustrate the difference in
cash flow in assumption and assumption-free periods, it is more appropriate to compare
the first 9-months of 2010 with the first 9-months of 2011.


For 9-months of 2010, cash flow from operations was $26.3M, but it declined -29.7% to a
meager $18.5M in the same period in 2011. In HCI's 3Q11 10-Q, the company provides a
simple explanation for the deterioration stating:


"Net cash provided by operating activities for the nine months ended September 30, 2010
was approximately $26.3 million, which resulted primarily from the collection of $19.5
million from Citizens in connection with our December 2009 assumption transaction".


In other words, 74% of cash flow YTD through September 2010 came directly from
Citizens in conjunction with the 4Q09 assumption. In the same period in 2011, without the
subsidy from Citizens, cash flow withered.


As far as we can tell, HCI no longer reports cash flow received from Citizens.


The flagging financial results at the holding company level were even more acute at the
statutory company. To illustrate the financial erosion, we examined year-to-date statutory
results as of 3Q11 and 3Q10 filed with National Association of Insurance Commissioners
(NAIC).


The table below shows summary financial results for the statutory company for the periods
in question. We provide both actual and pro-forma figures adjusting for the cash infusions.


Summary Statutory Financial Results

Underwriting losses in both periods shown reflect heavy MGA fees that shift cash to the
holding company. This is evident by contrasting the losses at the statutory company with
the (rapidly dwindling) gains at the holding company. However, the fee burden is just one
aspect. Increased costs and negative operating leverage, as illustrated at the holding
company level, are the more critical drivers.


The Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (OIR) described the phenomenon of increasing
costs in its 2010 Financial Examination Report on HCI, which was published in 2012. The
report noted that the increase in underwriting losses in 2010 stemmed from "the
Company's book of business maturing and additional losses incurred from the acquisition
of policies related to the depopulation".


Underwriting losses driven by the "maturing book" necessitated capital infusions in both
periods to maintain surplus levels. For the 9-months 2011, HCI injected $4M in capital to
the surplus in the form of notes. This augments the $9.1M the company was required to
inject in 2010. The adjusted surplus illustrates the underlying dynamics of the business.


As reported, the surplus increased 21% in 9-months of 2010 and declined -1.5% in 9-
months 2011. On a pro-forma basis without capital infusions, the surplus would have
declined -15% in the first 9-months of 2010 and -8.8% for the full year due to the 4Q profit.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2504335-hci-group-the-wizards-of-tampa-part-ii 9/15


For the first 9-months of 2011 on a pro-forma basis, the surplus would have declined
-20.3% from the full-year 2010 figure. Without capital infusions, the surplus would have
declined from $24.1M to $17.5M, or -27% over the period in question.


The organic erosion in the surplus is further evident in HCI's deteriorating net position
(adjusted for $4M capital infusion), which shows liabilities growing at almost twice the rate
of assets.


Absent an assumption, HCI's maturing book of business was characterized by high churn,
persistent underwriting losses and collapsing cash flow, which drove surplus erosion - all
during a hurricane-free period.


3. Homewise Acquisition - Saving the Day


Both 2010 and 2011 were politically charged years for the Florida insurance industry. By
2011, 6 of the 18 takeout companies had failed without a single hurricane landing. and the
press was becoming highly critical as many believed that homeowner's policies and
taxpayers' funds were being transferred to financially shaky companies.


In early 2011, the troubled takeout company First Home insurance was taken over by
Homewise insurance. Only 3-months after the merger, the combined entity was ordered
into liquidation. Homwise's rapid post-acquisition failure gives the appearance that the
deal was an attempt to prevent the failure of two troubled companies in a state-engineered
"bail out".


In 3Q11, HCI acquired the failed Homewise out of liquidation. As we noted, in the first 9-
months of 2011, HCI was experiencing rapidly eroding financial results with material
underwriting losses. In our view, HCI's financial performance indicates it may not have
been far behind Homewise in the downward spiral toward insolvency prior to the
acquisition. When viewed in this context, the HCI/Homewise acquisition looks like a
marriage of convenience meant to bail out the troubled HCI along with the other failed
companies.


The acquisition prevented the political fallout that would likely have occurred had the
70,000 Homewise/First Home policies reverted to Citizens and it certainly helped HCI. The
massive transfer of $43.5M in unearned premiums to HCI effectively recapitalized the
company, perhaps even saving it from the fate of the three previous companies that held
the Homewise policies.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2504335-hci-group-the-wizards-of-tampa-part-ii 10/15


The Homewise acquisition was structured as an assumption. Its predictable benefits
provided HCI with a much needed subsidy to stem the erosion and make the business
appear profitable. The table below shows the 3Q11-4Q12 results to illustrate the impact of
the deal.


Homewise Acquisition

As expected, reinsurance costs declined markedly as a percentage of gross premiums.
Although the value of exposure increased 140%, reinsurance costs increased only 6% on
an absolute basis and declined from 42% of gross premiums in 3Q11 to 28% of gross
premiums in 4Q11 and 26% in 1Q12.


The lack of reinsurance costs flowed through the P&L from 4Q11 to 2Q12. The total
expense ratio declined from 97% in 3Q11 to a low of 82% in 2Q12. Underwriting profit
margins increased proportionately from 3% in 3Q11 to 14% in 4Q11 and 18% for both
1Q12 and 2Q12.


As part of the acquisition, Citizens transferred $43.5M in unearned premiums to HCI.
Similar to the 2009 period, the cash infusion accounted for the majority of cash generated
following the assumption. The transfer accounted for 58% of the total $74.5M generated in
the four quarters including the assumption.

The Homewise assumption and the associated subsidies turned around HCI's financial
results, restored margins, and recapitalized the company. The resurrected business model
was maintained with the 4Q12 and 4Q13 assumptions as well.


4. The Real 2013 Numbers - Adjusting for the Distortions


HCI's assumption-dependant business model masks the underlying economics of its
business. Reinsurance costs are understated, losses are uncommonly low, and policy
acquisition costs on high-churn assumed policies are nil until renewal.


In the exhibit below, we stripped HCI's 2013 underwriting model of assumption benefits to
generate pro-forma figures. We believe our pro-forma estimates accurately reflect what
HCI's 2013 results would have looked like in the absence of an assumption.


2013 Adjusted and Pro Forma Income Statement


Source: Statutory statements and estimates.


We adjusted reinsurance costs to 47.5% of gross written, which is consistent with our
previous calculation discussed in Part I. We adjusted HCI's loss ratio from the stunningly
low 19.3% to 30%, inline with HCI's historical averages and those of peers.


Changing the two key cost centers drives the total expense ratio to increase from 70.1%
to 98.1%, indicating that with normalized reinsurance and loss expenses, HCI's model is
only marginally profitable.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2504335-hci-group-the-wizards-of-tampa-part-ii 12/15


HCI's adjusted total expense ratio of 98.1% is inline with those of Federated National
(NASDAQ:FNHC) and United Insurance (NASDAQ:UIHC), which are 98.9% and 92.5%,
respectively. The model is inline despite having policy acquisition expenses we estimate to
be approximately $20M below normalized costs. Given the lack of policy acquisition costs,
HCI should be more profitable than its competitors, even after adjusting for reinsurance
and loss expenses. We believe that HCI is not more profitable despite the cost
advantages because the company's compensation expenses are significantly higher than
other DFIs. We estimate that HCI's compensation cost is approximately $24M compared
to $10.1M and $14M for FNHC and UIHC, respectively. It would appear that a good
portion of the subsidy HCI receives for taking Citizens policies go out the door as
management compensation. Were policy acquisition costs to be normalized, the total
expense ratio would increase to approximately 104% from the current estimate of 98.1%.


5. Earnings Rich, Cash Poor - Further Evidence of Trouble


The table below shows that while HCI's net income grew by 117% in 2013 the cash flow
from operations collapsed by -48%.


The collapse was in part a function of HCI's reinsurance program, which required the
company to pre-fund a large portion of its reinsurance, and the bookings of contingent
profit commissions. These are non-cash, accrued profits and are booked in "other assets".
Lastly, the company's unearned premium account cash cushion declined materially. We
assume that is due to the assumption of shorter duration policies from Citizens, thus
limiting the cash portion of the subsidy to HCI.

The structural elements combined with the decline in unearned premiums caused cash
flow to tumble from $106M to $55.5M. from 2012 to 2013. Likewise, cash flow of $55.5M
is roughly even with 2011's $56M despite net income increasing over 500% and net
premiums earned increasing from $88.1M to $234M over the same period. We find the
cash flow comparisons deeply troubling.


HCI's debt financing also raises significant questions. The company raised $143M in debt
during the period, in part to fund the $30M stock buyback at roughly 3x book value. We
think that large assumptions from Citizens will become increasingly difficult; as such, we
believe the company will need to take some action to perpetuate the illusion of growth and
high margins. We suspect that HCI will try to fund an acquisition with the debt financing in
effort to stem the organic erosion in their book.


Lastly, it is worth noting that between the $30.9M buyback and $10.9M in dividends, HCI
spent $41.8M or 75% of their declining cash flow from operations "giving back" to
shareholders. We view the fact that the buyback was contingent on the company's ability
to raise the debt as indication the HCI could ill-afford the buyback and may be concerned
with low cash generation, as they should be.
