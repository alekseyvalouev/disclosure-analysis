This Time Isn't Different - Miller Energy Is A Short

by: Forensic Accounter


Miller Energy Resources (NYSE:MILL) is an oil and gas exploration and production
company primarily focused on the Cook Inlet area of Alaska. On 12/10/2009, MILL
acquired Cook Inlet Energy, consisting of the former Alaskan assets of Pacific Energy
Resources, in a competitive bankruptcy auction, paying less than $5 million. Immediately
after, MILL wrote the value of the assets up to $480 million, booking a pre-tax gain on the
acquisition of $460 million.


This unusual transaction and the dubious background of Miller's management and
financial partners has been covered in articles from The Street Sweeper, and I would
recommend you read them for additional background information, however I believe a
brief history of these assets is useful. The Cook Inlet assets that Miller currently owns
were originally acquired and developed by Forcenergy in the late 90s. Forcenergy went
bankrupt and eventually merged with Forrest Oil Corp in 2000. Forest then sold the
Alaskan assets of Forcenergy to Pacific Energy in 2007, and Pacific Energy went bankrupt
in early 2009, finally selling a group of their Alaska assets to Miller Energy.


This article will take a closer look at the flawed assumptions MILL and their investors are
using to derive the company's reserve value, as well as the shaky financial footing the
company is currently on, both of which should concern current and potential investors in
MILL, especially if history repeats itself.


Reserve Report Assumptions


Since MILL is currently generating large losses, and low production relative to its current
market capitalization, it's clear that investors are valuing the company based primarily on
their undeveloped reserves, and those reserves' prospects for future, profitable
production. This could prove incredibly risky should current assumptions about the value
of these undeveloped reserves prove to be faulty.


MILL attached a reserve report by Ralph E. Davis Associates to their most recent 10-K
filing breaking out the reserves of their Alaskan properties (containing the vast majority of
the company's total reserves) in more detail.

The report breaks out reserves, and assumed future revenues, expense and cash flows
by developed-producing, developed non-producing, and undeveloped reserve categories.
This table is reproduced below:


The present value of the expected net income from Miller's proved reserves using a
discount rate of 10% is $446.726 million, which is likely what attracts investors to the
stock, even though 80% of this value is tied to the company's undeveloped reserves. As
an aside, it would likely be imprudent for investors to use a 10% discount rate when
valuing Miller's reserves since the company's cost of capital is much higher (their senior
debt has an interest rate of 18%).


From here, dividing the revenue and expense data points by the barrels of reserves can
highlight the per barrel operating assumptions utilized in the company's reserve report, the
result of which is displayed below. For example, the "Operating Costs / Boe" under the
"Producing" column is calculated by dividing the total operating costs under the producing
column and dividing it by the number of total barrels in the producing column.


Oddly, currently producing reserves have an assumed operating cost of $49.58 per barrel,
which is around what Miller has reported in their recent results, however proved
developed but non-producing reserves are expected to have far lower operating costs of
$13.31 per barrel, and undeveloped reserves are assumed to cost only $5.57 per barrel.
This seems absurdly low since operating costs of $5.57 per barrel would be amongst the
lowest in the country, especially when Forest Oil Corp noted that the Cook Inlet had higher
operating costs than other properties in the US.

Finally, the estimated development costs seem equally illogical. Capital costs for reserves
that are already developed but not currently producing are $19.32 per barrel, yet capital
costs for completely undeveloped reserves are assumed to somehow be less than a 1/2
the cost for developed non-producing costs. It is likely that both the capital costs and
operating costs for the company's undeveloped reserves will be far higher than is currently
assumed making the true present value of these assets a fraction of that assumed in the
report.


Miller's reserve assumptions have also received scrutiny from the SEC as demonstrated
by several CORRESP files over the last two years, ultimately requiring MILL to restate
their 2011 and 2010 reserves.


The best response from MILL bulls would be that as production increases, the company
will lower costs with scale. However, this ignores the fact Pacific Energy's Alaska division
(the predecessor assets that are now Miller's Alaskan assets) had operating costs of
$44.33 per barrel in 2009 (equivalent to Miller's operating costs per year in 2011) despite
producing more than 4,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (approximately 4 times larger
than Miller's current production rate).


Relative Valuation


Even if one ignores the company's long history of operating losses, and take Miller's
reserve assumptions at face value, assuming they are able to successfully raise the
massive amounts of capital required to fully convert their undeveloped reserves to
producing status without severely diluting shareholders, the company would still be
dramatically overvalued at today's price.


For example, Miller's proved reserves totaled 9.294 million barrels of oil equivalent
(NYSE:BOE) as of their most recent fiscal year end. Comparing this to the company's
current enterprise value (the sum of a company's market cap and their net debt) of $255
million, yields an EV / BOE of $27.43, meaning investors are valuing each barrel of
reserve (developed and undeveloped) at $27.43 for MILL. This is very expensive,
especially when compared to much larger, more diversified, and lower cost peers who
have already spent the capital to develop a much higher percentage of their reserves. The
following table compares MILL to Apache Corp (NYSE:APA), Devon Energy (NYSE:DVN),
Chesapeake Energy (NYSE:CHK) and Buccaneer Energy (NYSE:BCC).

Buccaneer Energy (trading on the Australian stock change under the ticker symbol BCC)
is the most directly comparable company. Buccaneer Energy is focused on the Cook Inlet
area of Alaska (the same area as MILL), and even uses the same company as MILL to
complete their reserve reports (Ralph E. Davis). Buccaneer actually has a greater amount
of proved reserves than MILL, and in the second quarter, had nearly equal production
levels, yet they trade for nearly 1/3 the valuation MILL does. If Miller's enterprise value fell
to the same level as Buccaneer's, MILL's stock price would fall by over 75% to $1.21 per
share.


Debt Troubles


MILL entered into a new debt facility with Apollo Investment Corporation on 6/29/2012.
The facility allows for an initial borrowing base of $55 million and initial availability of $40
million, with the remaining $15 million only available when MILL demonstrates that it can
raise $15 million in additional equity. MILL immediately borrowed the $40 million initially
available, and is seeking to unlock the remaining $15 million under the credit facility by
selling $15 million in preferred stock. The facility has an interest rate of 18%, which would
imply an interest expense of nearly $10 million annually (assuming $55 million is
eventually borrowed). This is far in excess of any historic operating earnings MILL has
generated thus far, calling into question their ability to service this debt. These fears were
confirmed in Miller's most recent quarterly report for the three months ending 7/31/2012, in
which the company said they expected to not be in compliance with the credit facility's
covenants on the first measurement date.


MILL claimed in their most recent earnings call that the upcoming covenant miss was due
to a simple delay in construction of their rig, but the company has been a serial offender in
over-promising and under-delivering on production growth. For example, looking at one of

the company's presentations from 2 years ago, they projected increasing production to
over 5,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day by the end of 2011. For the quarter ending
July 31, 2012 production averaged less than 1,000 boe / day.


On the earnings call, MILL disclosed their estimated capital spending levels once they
started the full drilling program would be $8 million a month, or $24 million a quarter. This
means that even with the additional $30 million in capital the company is seeking, it would
not provide for more than 4 months of drilling.


Preferred Stock


Investors buying into the company's recent preferred stock offerings should also be
concerned. MILL recently sold 25,750 shares of Series B Preferred Stock, and issued
warrants to purchase 128,750 shares of common stock, exercisable at $5.28 per share, to
the purchasers of the preferred stock for gross proceeds of $2.575 million. The company
is currently in the process of offering series C preferred stock which will have a 10.75%
yield and will be convertible into shares of MILL at $10 / share. The issues listed above
should concern investors in each preferred class since they have a derivative exposure to
the stock (either through warrants or conversion features), and the company's ability to
service their credit facility directly impacts whether MILL can make cash payments on the
preferred stock.


As noted in the preferred stock prospectus, MILL is only allowed to make cash dividend
payments to holders of the preferred stock if they are in compliance with the Capital
Covenants of their credit facility, which as discussed earlier, MILL does not expect to meet
at the first measurement date. On 9/26/2012 MILL filed an amendment to their credit
facility that moves back the first covenant measurement date, and allows the company to
create a cash reserve from which the company can make preferred dividend payments for
one year, regardless of covenant violations. This piggy bank that has been set aside to
make one year of preferred dividend payments, might initially give the illusion that MILL
can service their debt and dividend payments, but ultimately this should not fill investors
with confidence.


Finally, potential preferred stock investors should ask themselves whether an at-risk 10-
12% in a subordinated, preferred stock is adequate compensation when Apollo is
receiving an 18% interest rate for a secured debt position.


Disclosure: I am short MILL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own
opinions. I am not receiving compensation for it. I have no business relationship with any
company whose stock is mentioned in this article.
