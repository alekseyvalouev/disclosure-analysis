Citron Research Presents Peloton – Investors Pedaling 
Themselves into Frenzy  


2020 Target Price – $5 


 
Before we even start with the narrative, we are obligated to show the only chart 
that matters.

Unless Peloton invents a piece of equipment that works out for you – 
this is going to $5 (which is still a $1BN-$2BN market cap). 
 
Looking back over the past 5 years, one of biggest trading regrets held by Citron 
was not being more aggressive and staying short GoPro from the article we 
published in late 2014. 
https://citronresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/gpro-final.pdf 


 
While Wall St was giddy over the new “must have product”, Citron maintained 
that GoPro sold a consumer electronics device that would eventually show 
decelerating growth as competition came into the marketplace.  At the end of the 
day no matter how much lipstick Wall St put on this company, it was just a camera 
– the rest is history.  
 
Disclosure:  Yes, we own a Peloton bike just like we owned a GoPro, Fitbit, 
Blackberry, and even an ab roller… but who cares.  
 
In this report, we won't restate the obvious points that have been made by 
numerous short sellers regarding Peloton’s future.  These include (but are by no 
means limited to):  


• Obvious comparisons to GoPro and Fitbit 
• History of fitness products in the public marketplace 
• Dependence on the spin class trend and fitness fads 
• A marketing plan that shows a niche audience 
• The disingenuous rhetoric of management on the value proposition of 


Peloton ownership vs. a gym membership  
 
Instead, we will focus on clear flaws in the Peloton business model and a 
management team that has been overly promotional while trying to justify an 
unrealistic valuation that is disconnected from all reality in the post WeWork 
economy.  Combine this with a share structure that is designed to make long term 
shareholders sweat and we have all the makings of a compelling short. 
 


Once you get past management’s grandiose talks, you have a company that sells 
hardware and software.

Hardware 
 


Citron gives credit to Peloton for creating a product that incorporates interactive 
classes into its hardware and combines it with an aspirational marketing campaign 
that has found its way into the homes of those who can afford it.   





Note:  the hardware aspect of this company has not changed in a meaningful way 
since the bike’s introduction in 2014 when the valuation of the company was 
$100MN.  Citron need not dwell on the failure of Peloton’s recently launched 
treadmill.   





While Peloton has enjoyed a first mover advantage, the lack of differentiation of 
its bike has finally caught up to it as the competition is not only making virtually 
identical exercise bikes but ones that are both more affordable and functional.   





 
https://www.zdnet.com/article/best-peloton-alternatives-top-smart-exercise-bikes/ 





It can be argued that competitors in the hardware space have used their second 
mover advantage to create better spin bikes that have swivel screens (e.g., 
allowing mat exercises), open platforms (e.g., allowing users to watch TV or Netflix 
while they are riding the bikes), and iPad attachments.  None of these features are 
offered by Peloton.   





In addition, competitors have done what Peloton was not able to do by expanding 
their digitally integrated at home fitness hardware offerings to new segments like 
Mirror, Tonal, boxing, rowing, etc.   





The lack of differentiation between Peloton and its lower priced competitors is 
best highlighted by Peloton’s lawsuits against Echelon Fitness and Flywheel Sports.

Note:  legal experts don’t believe Peloton has a real case as noted in Bloomberg 
Law: 


“Peloton didn’t invent computerized exercise equipment that could let users 
compete remotely with other users.  Nor did it invent the touchscreen, the exercise 
bike, spin classes or on-demand programming.”   
https://news.bloomberglaw.com/ip-law/pelotons-moat-depends-on-patent-challenges-it-may-not-win 





Consider this fact regarding Peloton's hardware – Peloton has spent almost 
$600MN over the last 3 years in marketing to capture the high-income low 
hanging fruit while competition was low.  Going forward, competition is so 
intense that some competitors are even offering to give the exercise bike for free 
with a digital subscription.  Citron believes Peloton’s glory days of hardware sales 
are in the rear-view mirror.

limited?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIsKKm4fOj5gIVCdVkCh0ZowrIEAEYASAAEgLVYPD_BwE 
 
Rather than taking Citron’s word, spend 15 minutes researching exercise bikes on 
Google and you will see the aggressive marketing of Peloton’s competitors.   
 
By looking at just the hardware, as Peloton moves down market and away from 
the low hanging fruit, the company will inevitably compete with Amazon and the 
numerous lower priced alternatives if they intend to be anywhere close to 
consensus expectations.  
 
No one owns this stock for the equipment multiple.  If Peloton were to be 
considered an equipment company, it would be trading at $5 today as the leading 
gym equipment manufacturers (e.g., Nautilus and Life Fitness) trade/have sold at 
an EV/Sales multiple of 0.3x-0.5x.

Digital 
 
If you don’t own Peloton stock for hardware you own it for digital.  Let’s now look 
at its digital strategy.  First, Peloton is charging $39 a month for a connected 
experience to those who have purchased a Peloton bike for $2,245. 
 
Yet, with the Peloton digital app a customer can pay $12.99 for the same 
connected experience without having to pay $2,245 for the bike.  Peloton justifies 
this by saying the app is a lead gen source yet the company admits that less than 
10% of digital subscribers end up purchasing a connected fitness product.  
 
To put it in terms of digital content… Imagine if Netflix decided to increase its 
subscriber base by giving away its content to DirecTV subscribers for $3 a month 
rather than $12.99 and justified it by claiming they hoped to build enough brand 
loyalty that customers would eventually become Netflix subscribers.  Would 
anybody buy that strategy? 
 
Peloton's strategy has allowed its competitors to quickly exploit this flaw as they 
now advertise that their bikes can be used with the Peloton app.

As we move down market, the flaw in Peloton's digital strategy can be exploited 
by makers of any of the hundreds of bikes sold on Amazon for under $500. 
 
Defenders of Peloton might say the $500 bikes are not "connected"' – but 
welcome to 2020.  You want to see how you take an inexpensive bike and give it 
better connectivity and multimedia experience than a Peloton.   





 
 
For a one-time cost of $12, you can convert your existing bike into a Peloton.  
 
Maybe we are wrong -- there is a difference between the $39 a month vs. $12.99 
a month plan.

While heart rate and workout metrics are native to even inexpensive bikes, the 
only IP that Peloton appears to bring to the table is its leaderboard technology, 
which allows participants to compete against one another.  For years, Peloton 
touted this as an advantage as it turned exercise into entertainment.  While 
Citron believes this is used by a limited number of riders, it has been touted by 
Peloton management as a key differentiator.    
 
For those of you who don’t know the rest of the story, read about Foley’s folly.  
While designing the bike, one night at a bar CEO John Foley told a collaborator 
that Peloton may be infringing on a Microsoft patent that covers “computerized 
fitness equipment that is designed to simulate race conditions with other users”.  
Without holding this collaborator to a confidentiality clause, Peloton’s 
collaborator acquired the patent, sued Peloton for infringing on their patent, and 
then partnered with SoulCycle and Echelon Fitness to introduce competing

products eliminating the only benefit of the $39 a month subscription over the 
$12.99 a month plan.

Management 
 
While Peloton stock may move in the short-term on promotional commentary 
from management, the reality is that CEO John Foley has had a hard time with the 
truth.  He has a reputation for “loose lips” and “shooting from the hip”.  While 
these might be attributes of an aggressive entrepreneur, as a corporate CEO they 
can result in SEC violations and claims of outright fraud.  Take for example his 
repeated claims about Peloton’s profitability.  Needless to say, we all know that 
Peloton has never had a profitable year since inception.  


• In 2018, Foley tells CNBC that Peloton is profitable  
• In 2017, Peloton SVP of brand marketing says Peloton is “effectively” 


profitable 
• In 2016, Foley tells Inc. that Peloton is profitable  
• In 2015, Foley tells Bloomberg that Peloton is profitable

https://www.cbsnews.com/news/why-would-the-ceo-of-hot-ipo-peloton-say-it-was-profitable-when-it-was-not/ 


 
Foley’s loose language makes us question the integrity of his guidance and key 
performance metrics, most notably churn.  As noted by Emory professor Dan 
McCarthy, Peloton’s churn disclosure just “doesn’t pass the smell test” as 
Peloton’s 0.65% churn rate implies that the average customer keeps the digital 
subscription for 13 years!  Can we take the under? 
https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/peloton-hiding-retention-smoking-gun-its-churn-maybe-daniel-mccarthy/ 


  
Lastly, Foley’s willingness to play fast and loose with the rules have resulted in the 
company being the subject of a $300MN lawsuit from music publishers.  Knowing 
that music is beyond essential to their business, this issue should have been 
resolved before the IPO but instead Foley has launched a countersuit against the 
National Music Publishers Association.  Citron would love to dismiss this as sloppy 
management but we believe this was deliberate to deceive investors and 
manipulate the financials pre-IPO.

While Foley was busy getting Peloton to IPO as soon as possible, the Peloton 
management team completely failed to innovate new products.  The only product 
other than the bike that Peloton has launched, the treadmill, has not lived up to 
anyone’s expectations and the company has missed the mass movement to 
mirrored interactive home gyms and digital weights as Peloton, a $10BN 
company, is still a one trick pony.   
 
Instead of innovating, Peloton has positioned itself as a media company.  Where 
have we seen this before?

Worse than the Commercial  
 


Nothing better illustrates the incompetency of management and the future of this 
company than the CEO’s comments yesterday at the UBS conference.  Foley’s 
remarks are filled with hubris and lack any clear path for Peloton to ever grow into 
its current market cap.  In response to his backwards digital strategy that penalizes 
its best customers and how to extend his customer base beyond fitness 
enthusiasts, he describes his future customer as: 


 
Are these the new users who are worth almost $16K a piece to the company’s EV? 


There are more things wrong with the above statement than the now infamous 
commercial.  


The assumptions made in the above statement are ludicrous:

• The Peloton app has taken someone with a dusty old treadmill to a fitness 
enthusiast overnight who runs and does yoga 


• This person’s dusty old treadmill happens to be in front of a 60-inch smart 
TV 


• Whether it be Netflix, YouTube, CNN, or CNBC, this person has never used 
this treadmill until they could download the Peloton app  


• Although the person is not a fitness enthusiast, they choose to pay $12.99 a 
month instead of the plethora of free content on YouTube 


• Most importantly, this person will eventually buy a $3K-$4K treadmill and 
pay $39 a month for the exact same offering for which they had been 
paying $12.99  


 
Lock-up and Share Structure 
 
Peloton management is clearly eager to cash out.  In 2017 and 2018, Peloton 
repurchased almost $200MN of stock from insiders including CEO John Foley, 
President William Lynch, COO Thomas Cortese, and Chief Legal Officer Hisao Kushi 
at as low as $5 per share. 





Peloton currently has a float of ~40MN shares.  With Peloton’s upcoming lockup 
expiry in March, an additional ~240MN shares will become available for sale.  
While we believe Foley will say or do anything to keep the stock up until the lock-
up expires, that is OK…. we are patient.  
 
Valuation 
 
Post WeWork and a new market reality that more heavily scrutinizes money 
losing companies, why is Peloton trading at a market cap of $10BN?   
 
To put Peloton’s ridiculous valuation into perspective, we compared the 
company’s valuation on a per user basis versus other leading fitness, streaming, 
and popular apps.  The takeaway is clear.  Peloton at $10BN or even $5BN makes 
zero sense.

We have already established that you don’t own Peloton for the hardware or the 
software.  So, the only thing you own Peloton for is the subscribers.  Let’s compare 
Peloton vs. a range of peers.  





On an EV per user basis, Peloton is 2,286% more expensive than the average of 
this peer group.  If Peloton had the same value per user as the average of this 
peer group, the stock would be valued at $5.   





This is all you need to see
December 10, 2019

Note to reader:  by no means is Citron saying that Peloton’s revenue will decline 
by 70% or 80% but even a small decrease in growth will result in a large decrease 
in share price.  If Peloton ends up being a $3 stock that would make this a $1BN 
spin bike company.  Nothing short of a huge success.   





We promise that we will look back in 3 years and remember Peloton as a $10BN 
company and our only regret will be that we were not short more.
