The Sell-Side's
Half-Baked
Research On
AFSI's Expense
Ratio
Nov. 7, 2014 12:30 PM ET | Includes: AmTrust Financial Ser…


As usual when anyone criticizes a public company, the sell-side analysts
rushed to defend AmTrust (NASDAQ:AFSI) after our initial report.


One of them was posted to seeking alpha by "User 448075" and can be found
here.


I will address each of his counter-arguments in time, but I wanted to address
what he is missing on the expense ratio and DAC.


First, he acknowledges the logic behind others' criticisms of AFSI:


“ Deferred Amortization Costs: In theory, it makes sense that a company's"deferred expense ratio" (i.e., DAC/[unearned premium less prepaid
reinsurance]) shouldn't exceed its current period expense ratio, reflecting
non-deferrable expenses that must be expensed immediately through the
income statement.


Then, he dismisses them by pointing out that other insurance companies have
high DAC ratios because of the long durations of policies.


“ In general, life and warranty products have longer time spans and incertain cases have higher commission rates reflecting the greater
required sales effort. In the case of the latter, following the approach laid
out in the short report, pure-play P&C companies carry lower "deferred
expense ratios" while warranty and life related companies carry higher
metrics.

While true that companies with long-duration policies can have a higher DAC,
this analyst does not provide any substantiation for his later comment that
with these adjustments, AFSI looks fine:


“ Making these adjustments leaves the delta to P&C peers easily explainedby the higher ratio for companies with warranty exposure (AIZ, AIG, AFG,
ORI), or companies where longer duration life products are sold (AFG,
UFCS, HIG, AIG, CINF), which we highlight to show how DAC ratios
change with policy duration, fully understanding it's a poor business
comparison given AmTrust's lack of life exposure and we therefore limit
comparison to mostly P&C companies with tangential life exposure.


In fact, one can compare AFSI against it's own history, as I did in "AmTrust
Financial Services Excessive Cost Capitalization Masks De Minimis Tangible
Book Value".


One more flaw in his logic...consider this comment:


“ Additionally, in AmTrust's case, we believe the previous short reportshave failed to account for the entirety of AmTrust's deferred revenues
outside of unearned premiums, which include at YE13 $84.2 million of
Deferred Warranty revenue, and a portion of $147.1 million in accrued
expenses and liabilities.


There are two flaws with this comment. First, including deferred revenues from
non-insurance businesses in a comparison of capitalized/deferred
costs/revenues of the insurance business mixes apples and oranges, which is
something the company likes to do and he almost surely got the idea from
management.


Second, if one includes non-insurance deferred revenues, one also needs to
consider the capitalized costs of non-insurance businesses. AFSI is tight-lipped
about the "prepaid expenses" line, but I suspect it is almost entirely comprised
of phantom assets that were created so that the company didn't have to
recognize the expense when cash went out the door...


I look forward to this and other analysts' attempts to explain away what I
believe is plain as day -- AFSI's expense ratio advantage is a mirage and a
function of bad accounting rather than "technology" -- and I intend to expose
