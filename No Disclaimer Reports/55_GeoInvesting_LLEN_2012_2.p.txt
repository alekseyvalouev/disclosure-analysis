Recordings and Transcripts
Provide Conclusive Proof
that L & L Int (LLEN) Never
Purchased the Ping Yi Mine
January 19, 2012 By GeoTeam


Over the past few days, we have presented indisputable
evidence that L&L Energy (LLEN: NASDAQ) has materially
misled its investors and the SEC. For two years now, LLEN
has unambiguously claimed to be a 100% owner of the
Ping Yi mine, which allegedly provides almost 40% of its
claimed capacity. As we explained in


our original full report


LLEN does not own the Ping Yi Mine.


After the report, some investors have stated that the SAIC
file we pulled on Jan 13, 2012 showing that LLEN does not
own the Ping Yi Mine is not the most up to date SAIC filing.
They have also disputed what the sales agent of the mine,
Mr. Wu, said.


We will now present the most compelling piece of evidence
that we have, the recordings and transcripts. The
conversations that you are about to read will make it
crystal clear what actually happened in this story and that
LLEN does not own the Ping Yi Mine.


The first conversation is a new conversation with Mr. Zhao
Weijun (赵维君), the vice director of Company Registry of Guizhou SAIC Office on Jan 19.


2012 (Beijing Time). Mr. Zhao Weijun clearly explained what

Jan 19, 2012 Conversation with Mr. Zhao Weijun, Vice
Director of the Guizhou SAIC office, proving we have
the most current SAIC filing – Full Recording and
Transcript


On multiple occasions in December, 2011 and January
2012, we contacted the sales representative for the Ping Yi
Mine, Mr. Wu. Mr. Wu confirmed that the mine was up for
sale by an investment group (four individuals) with no
discernible ties to LLEN. When we asked him whether LLEN
owned the mine, he answered an insistent no, and doubted
that LLEN was even financially strong enough to make such
an acquisition. He also told us that LLEN had discussed an
acquisition in 2009, but no deal had happened.


We recorded two conversations with Mr. Wu, sales
representative of the Ping Yi Mine on Jan 11, 2012 and Jan
16, 2012: The first one is a conversation prior to our first
alert on Jan 13, 2012 and the second one is after our alert.

There is a confusion regarding the date on the SAIC file

There is a date of Aug. 20, 2008 as the examination date
(核准日期) on the file we pulled on Jan 13, 2012. Some
people regard that the file we pulled only explain the legal
status of Ping Yi Mine up to Aug. 20, 2008. We already
explained this issue as follows:


“The second date, “2008-08-20ʺ highlighted above, is the date that the business license


reflec�ng the last change in corpora�on informa�on was issued or examined. On that


date, the Ping Yi Mine changed its official informa�on from Yidong Village, Pingguan Town,


Pan County to Yiche Village, Pingguan Town, Pan County and obtained its most recent


business license. The SAIC filing is telling us that since that date, no material aspect of the


business structure has changed.”

Key Points of conversa�ons are below:


To clarify this issue, we called Mr. Zhao Weijun (赵维君), the vice director of Company


Registry of Guizhou SAIC Office, which is in charge of the company registra�on of Guizhou


province, picked up our call and confirmed our explana�on. The key points of the


conversa�on between our inves�gator and Mr. Zhao Weijun (赵维君) is as follows:


Geo: Here it is. This company is established on Aug. 2, 2000. There is an examina�on date


(核准日期) which is Aug. 20, 2008. At the bo�om of the file, there is a date, which is Jan


13, 2012. I want to know, what does the examina�on date (核准日期) mean? (是这样的，


这个企业的成立日期是2000年8月2日。上面有一个核准日期是2008年8月20日。然后


这个文件最底下是2012年1月13日。我想问你一下，那个核准日期是什么意思？)


Mr. Zhao: Examina�on date (核准日期), for example, if the company comes to our office


to do the corporate change, such as business scope, and we exanimate the corporate


change, that day shall be the examina�on date. There is only one establishment date,


which shall not change at all. (核准日期，比方说，它今年来变更，我们核准以后，比


方说它变更经营范围，我们核准以后，这就是核准日期。如果说成立日期，它只有


一个，它不会变的。)


Geo: Yes.


Mr. Zhao: To the examina�on date, if the company changes one item, such as company


name, registered capital, there shall be an examina�on date for each change. (核准日


期，如果说它有变更事项，比如说变更名称，变更注册资本，每变更一次，就有核


准日期。)


Geo: ok. For example, the date on the bo�om is Jan 13. On Jan 13, we obtained its


partner informa�on, as this is a partnership. Can we say that the partner informa�on we


obtained is as of today, right? (哦。那比如说，它最底下日期是1月13日，然后我在1


月13日查到了它的，因为这个是合伙企业，查到了它的合伙人的情况。那等于就是


说今天它合伙人是哪些就是哪些，对吧？)


Mr. Zhao: Yes. You are right. (对。对。)


Geo: Can I also understand in this way that, a�er the examina�on date (核准日期) up


today, there is no change of shareholder and/or partner? (那我是不是还可以这么理

解，也就是说，在核准日期一直到今天为止，它没有更换或股东或者合伙人什么之


类的？)


Mr. Zhao: Yes. Yes. There is no change. (对，对。那就没有。)


Geo: There is no change. OK. I understand. Addi�onally, annual inspec�on date and


examina�on date are different, right?


Mr. Zhao: Yes.


Geo: ok. If so, when is the annual examination date?


Mr. Zhao: It is a date varying from March 1 to June 30.


Geo: Now, the examina�on date (核准日期) of the company is Aug. 20, 2008. We can say


there is no any corporate change from Aug. 20, 2008 to now, right? (那现在就是说，这


个公司的核准日期是2008年8月20日，那就是说2008年8月20日到今天，它没有做任


何变更，对吧？)


Mr. Zhao: Yes. You are right. (对。对。对)


Geo: thank you very much. How can I call you? (谢谢。那您怎么称呼？)


Mr. Zhao: My last name is Zhao. (免贵姓赵)


Geo: Are you vice director, Mr. Zhao? (赵副局长，对吧？)


Mr. Zhao: Yes. (是的。)


Geo: thank you so much. Vice Director Zhao. (谢谢你，赵副局长。)


Two conversations with Mr. Wu, the sales agent of
Ping Yi Mine


After the GeoTeam found the sales post of Ping Yi Mine at
the beginning of Dec. 2011, we contacted Mr. Wu on Dec

12, 2011 to talk about the possible acquisition of the Ping
Yi Mine. Our GEO investigator pretended to be from an
investment company from Beijing China. In our first talk,
Mr. Wu confirmed that Ping Yi Mine was still for sale.


After that, we periodically contacted Mr. Wu regarding the
acquisition of Ping Yi Mine and confirmed with him several
times that the Ping Yi Mine was not acquired by Fuyuan
County Baoxing Economic & Trade Co. Step by Step, GEO
told Mr. Wu that it was LLEN that told us that Ping Yi Mine
was acquired by Fuyuan County Baoxing Economic & Trade
Co. for the consideration of around USD 4 million at the
end of 2009. Mr. Wu denied this claim by LLEN. To build
trust, the Geoteam told Mr. Wu that a group of people led
by Mr. Zheng (郑总) from Beijing may visit Ping Yi Mine
before the Chinese New Year.


On Jan 11, 2012 (Wed.) (Beijing Time), GEO called Mr. Wu
again and made an excuse that the group of people cannot
visit Ping Yi Mine as there are not available air tickets
before the Chinese New Year. We recorded this call and
confirmed relevant issues surrounding the ownership of
Ping Yi Mine again with Mr. Wu. The key part of the
conversation is as follows:


[…]


Geo: then. We will try to visit you before the Lantern
Festival (Feb. 5, 2012). Is it ok?


Mr. Wu: OK. OK.


GEO: Additionally, we contacted Longteng Mining (龙
腾矿业，LLEN’s Chinese name) again. They told us that
Baoxing Economic & Trade CO., Ltd. paid you tens of
millions in RMB, or USD 4 million to purchase the
mine at the end of 2009 or beginning of 2010. Did
you have this deal or not?

https://geoinvesting.com/3443/ 7/11


Mr. Wu: No. No.


GEO: No? No for this deal?


Mr. Wu: the deal failed at last （最后没成啊）.


GEO: this deal failed at last, right?


Mr. Wu: Yes.


GEO: Oh. They said that, at that time, Baoxing did pay
around USD 4 million, or RMB more than 20 million
amount. It is to say that that deal failed at last?


Mr. Wu: Yes.


GEO: Oh. They said that, at that time, Baoxing did pay
around USD 4 milion, or RMB more than 20 million. It is to
say that that deal failed at last?


Mr. Wu: Yes.


GEO: OK. We are not clear about their stance. Whatever,
we just disregard this [LLEN’s stance].


Mr. Wu: Yes.


[…]


After we released our initial alert on Jan 13, 2012, we
knew that some investors may call Mr. Wu during the long
holiday weekend and that LLEN may also contact Mr. Wu
regarding this issue. On Jan 16, 2012 (Monday) GEO’s
investigator called Mr. Wu to once again confirm the
relevant issues surrounding the ownership of Ping Yi Mine.
Mr. Wu confirmed again that Ping Yi Mine is still owned by

four individuals and LLEN did not acquire the mine. He also
said that LLEN did contact them to acquire Ping Yi Mine but
that deal never went through. Mr. Wu also told us that
several guys called him during the weekend with “private
numbers” or “oversea numbers”. Furthermore, Mr. Wu did
not mention whether LLEN contacted him or not after we
release this press release. The key part of this conversation
is as follows:


[…]


Mr. Wu: Now, our biggest boss is Mr. Zhang, Zhang
Baoguo. The mine is owned by individuals. (我们最大的老
板姓张，张保国。我们现在是私有的。)


GEO: What? （现在是什么？）


Mr. Wu: owned by individuals. At the beginning, LLEN
(龙腾矿业) did discuss this deal with us. At last we did
not reach a final deal. （私有的。最初，龙腾矿业谈是谈过，但是最终
没成交易。）


GEO: Oh.


Mr. Wu: LLEN did not pay money to us at all. （他们也没有
付钱。）


GEO: signed a contract but not pay any money? So the
claimed agreement is a void contract?


Mr. Wu: Yes.


GEO: Oh. The agreement on the hand of my boss is a void
contract?


Mr. Wu: Yes. Even mentioned something called like Baoxing
Group. （还说那个什么宝兴集团）

GEO: Yes. Baoxing Economic & Trade Company. Therefore,
my boss complained about Mr. Zhang a lot and said he did
not do a good job. As this is a big issue, we also pulled the
SAIC file of Ping Yi Mine. Based on the SAIC file, we
realized that Ping Yi Mine is owned by four individuals as a
partnership. (the voice is disturbed) Hello?


Mr. Wu: I am listening.


GEO: This is owned by four individuals as a partnership,
not owned by LLEN, right?


Mr. Wu: Yes.


Mr. Wu: Yes. Now, it is owned by four individuals and
it is not sold to any other. （是的。现在是四个自然人所有的，没有
卖给任何人。）


GEO: Yes. I read the SAIC file and it says that it is
owned by four individuals.（是的，我知道，我看了工商档案，是说
四个自然人。）


Mr. Wu: No such a thing (acquisition by LLEN) at all.

right? （根本没有这个事情，对不对？）


Mr. Wu: There was this thing. But, there is no reached
deal. （有是有过，但是最后没有成交。）

can do. Then, I can report to Mr. Zheng, my boss, to
arrange the following things and possible trip. After our
arrangement, I will give you a call. Is that ok?

Mr. Wu: You already know the information of the mine,
right?


GEO: Yes. This is the only thing in doubt. Even though I am
already on my vacation, my boss still asked me to call you
to confirm this.


Mr. Wu: There are several guys that called me in these
days to enquire about this issue. There was no phone
number reflected on my cell phone. Sometime, it reflects
“private phone number” or “oversea phone number”. （这两
天有好几个人打电话给我，来问这个事情。他那个号码没有来电显示，还有就是显示


为私人号码或者海外号码。）

were from your company. （他们打电话都是问这个事情，我还以为是你
