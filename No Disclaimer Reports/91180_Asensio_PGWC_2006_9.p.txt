USAI was to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of PGWC,


according to the Form 8-K �led by USAI on February 8, 2005.


According to a Form 8-K/A �led by USAI, the deal was


rescinded on March 31, 2005. Curiously, Mr. Durland signed


the March 31, 2005 agreement as a representative of both


parties – as the CFO of USAI and as the CFO of PGWC.


PGWC acquired Channel on April 4, 2005. According to the


agreement, PGWC issued 3,000,000 shares of common stock


for Channel’s outstanding debt. Channel’s stockholders were


represented by Mintmire & Associates in that acquisition.


Mr. Durland’s CPA �rm was also Channel’s auditor at the


same time as Mintmire & Associates served as counsel to


Channel, when it operated under the name of CEO-


Channel.net, Inc. in 2000.


In 2005 Mr. Mintmire was found guilty of obstruction of


justice in a federal grand jury investigation and also of


conspiracy to obstruct justice in an SEC probe, for concealing


documents from the SEC regarding one of his shell


companies.


The investigation of Mr. Mintmire began after Mr. Mintmire


organized a reverse merger of a shell company, Lucid


Concepts, Inc., with Clements Citrus Sales of Florida, to form


Clements Golden Phoenix (“Phoenix”). Subsequent to the


investigation, the government alleged that Phoenix was


controlled by Mr. Mintmire and was formed as part of a


stock pump-and-dump scheme in which Mr. Mintmire made


at least $705,000 selling stock in a company with phony


shareholders.


Mr. Mintmire was sentenced to 21 months in federal prison


and an-$80,000 �ne, and was prohibited from engaging in


any business that o�ers securities, investments or business


opportunities. He was also disbarred from The Florida Bar.


Mr. Mintmire was to report to prison on May 30, 2006, but is


currently out on bond, pending appeal.
