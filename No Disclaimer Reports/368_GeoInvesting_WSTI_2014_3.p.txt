Windstream (WSTI) – WSTI
Rebuttal to GeoInvesting
Report Unimpressive
July 9, 2014 By GeoTeam


Windstream’s (WSTI) CEO,CFO and COO filed form D
indicating they intend to sell shares and that they
have already sold shares.
More clarity provided on the fact that Vanguard
Financial Trust shares are not disclosed in WSTI’s
2013 10K.
Per 2013 10K, WSTI had a large outstanding liability
with its product manufacturer that was inhibiting it
from receiving additional units.


On July 7, 2014 Dan Bates, CEO of Windstream
Technologies (WSTI), issued a rebuttal press release to our
short thesis article that we published on Seeking Alpha on
July 1, 2014. The CEO challenged some of our evidence
even went as far as to state that:


“Either the author(s) does not know how to read
public filings or has elected to ignore the public
filings containing the correct information.”


The following article addresses the CEO’s rebuttal
comments and in our opinion shows management’s
inability to understand its own filings.


But before we discuss the specifics, investors may want to
know that despite all the great news issued by WSTI, the
CFO, CEO and COO have sold some stock as disclosed in a

Form D filed on June 6, 2014. It appears that they have
already sold $406,800 worth of stock.


1. The claim of 7.8M shares missing from Vanguard
Financial Trust (“VFT”)


Dan Bates attempted to address our inquiry into
share transaction activity by VFT:


Company Statement:


“An article alleges that 7.8 million shares have
“mysteriously disappeared.”


In fact, Vanguard Financial Trust (“VFT”), our
single largest investor, is an insider and cannot
sell its position. VFT currently holds every
share purchased, which is 9.9 million shares with
warrants totaling 2.8 million shares. Those
disclosures have been made by VFT and the
Company.


In fact, the article is incorrect in its
representations of share amounts, history of
purchases and assertions of a divestiture. Either
the author(s) does not know how to read public
filings or has elected to ignore the public filings
containing the correct information.”


We will take this opportunity to issue a timeline of
events relating to WSTI’s filing disclosure of VFT
equity ownership in WSTI. We originally questioned
why WSTI’ s 2014 10K filing did not show VFT’s
ownership stake in WSTI when it clearly should have
been obvious.

https://geoinvesting.com/windstream-rebuttal-to-geoinvesting-report-unimpressive/ 3/14


Note that an 8K/A filed on December 6, 2013, and covering
the period ended September 27, 2013, did not show VFT
as a shareholder.


Later, Vanguard Financial Trust’s (“VFT”) ownership stake
of 7.8 million shares was disclosed in a proxy of WSTI on
February 13, 2014.


A Form 3 pertaining to VFT (covering 9.9 million shares)
was filed on March 27, 2014 prompted by a transaction
that allegedly took place in August of 2013. This form 3
showed that VFT owned 9.9 million shares:


The 2013 10K was filed on April 11, 2014 and covered the
period ended March 31, 2014. VFT was omitted from the
10K.


As the 10K was filed well after the Form 3 and the
transaction date, we are correct to pose questions related
to VFT shares. Why did WSTI omit VFT ownership stake
from its 2013 10K? We have a hard time believing that not
including the ownership stake of its largest investor just
slipped management’s mind. Recall in our April 17, 2014
article about the AHII P&D that we discussed a
questionable ownership stake by an individual that was
once mentioned in a filing and then “magically”
disappeared in an amended filing.

December 6, 2013 8K/A omits VFT
February 13, 2014 proxy then mentions VFT (7.8M
shares)
The Form 3 pertaining to VFT was filed on March 27,
2014 prompted by a transaction that took place in
August of 2013 (9.9M shares).
The 2013 10K was filed on April 11, 2014 and covered
the period ended March 31, 2014. (Form 3 was
already filed well before the preparation of the 10k
and before March 31, 2014, so why was VFT not in the
10K).


Our question to management: If you are keenly aware
of who your largest investor is why was its share stake
information not in your 10K? Is it too far-fetched to
conclude that maybe the company does not want to
telegraph that Adrian James has invested in the company?


More importantly, we are curious why Dan Bates did
not address our findings that Adrian James, the
individual signing off on VFT form 3 filings disclosing
VFT’s ownership in WSTI, has been involved in prior
paid promotions on other penny stock companies.
Why is the company dealing with an investor (its largest)
who has been accused of running promotions in the past?
It appears hypocritical that in one breath, per an 8K filed
on June 27, 2014, management seems to condemn the
current promotion on their company by the Wall Street
Revelator, yet it appears they may have sold stock to a
promoter as part of a financing transaction. In fact, Adrian
James was allegedly involved in pumping another stock
through the Wall Street Revelator:

both a shareholder and promoter. I noticed you
linked an old article of ours:


http://bit.ly/1s6e4Vx


You’ll notice that Adrian James also used Andrew
Carpenter (WallStreet Revelator) to help promote
a past ticker for which he was involved in a
similar manner (OTCQB:PGLC).”


Furthermore, we provided evidence that Adrian has run
promotions in the past, but there is more evidence from an
I-Hub post.


Stock Professor Inc. has a location in West Lake Hills,
TX. Adrian James is included as an active officer.
Stock Professor Inc. filed as a Domestic For-Profit
Corporation on Wednesday, October 22, 2008 in the state
of Texas and is currently active. Adrian James serves as
the registered agent for this organization.

2. Contracts


The CEO stated:


“An article contends that contracts, distribution
agreements and past pilot successes with ACC
Limited, Meytek Group, Key City Trading, Suka
Wind & Solar, Senan Liberia, Inc., Africa Energy
Limited and Viza Networks, Limited are not real
and states “as is often the case with P&D’s, most
of these customers are located in emerging
markets.”


We never said that these agreements were not “real”. But
we are questioning the company’s ability to execute its
contracts if it can’t raise a substantial amount of capital.
Additionally, many of these “contracts” are just purchase
orders that appear to have not been filled. A Seeking Alpha
article published by Auspex Research on July 8, 2014
discusses a past $10M purchase order (in 2012) from a
Brazilian company that appears to have not been
meaningfully executed. The author states the company
also projected sales for 2012 and 2013 to come in at $5.6
million and $55.8 million respectively. Well, 2013 sales
were under a million. The author poses a scenario where
the company could have been using this purchase order
plus lofty sales projections “to possibly lure new investors”.


The following passages, not included in our original article,
from WSTI’s Q1 2014 filing show the company may
desperately be in the need of capital, one even showing
that the company had defaulted on a $1.4 million loan in
2012, of which it has not made any payments on as
disclosed in it’s Q1 2014 filing. Furthermore, per the
2013 10K, the company had a large outstanding
liability with its product manufacturer that was
inhibiting it from receiving additional units.

“We estimate that within the next 12 months we
will need substantial cash and liquidity for
operations, and we do not have sufficient
cash on hand to meet this requirement.” 2013
10K


“WindStream has a history of recurring losses
from operations and has an accumulated deficit
of $10,480,672 as of December 31, 2013.
Management is unable to predict if and when we
will be to generate positive cash flow. As a result,
there is substantial doubt about our ability to
continue as a going concern. Our plan regarding
these matters is to raise additional debt and/or
equity financing to allow us the ability to cover
our current cash flow requirements and meet our
obligations as they become due.” 2013 10K


“Our ability to pay key suppliers on time will
allow us to effectively manage our business.
Currently we have a large outstanding
liability with our product manufacturer that
is inhibiting us from receiving additional
units at this time. In addition, we have
other large outstanding accounts payable
with key suppliers that may inhibit the
Company from receiving system product in
the future.” 2013 10K


“In July 2011, the Company entered into a
$1,400,000 note agreement with the City of
North Vernon, Indiana. Interest accrues at 5.5%
and the note matures on August 1, 2016. As of
March 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the
note had an outstanding balance of $1,400,000.
The Company was unable to pay the interest and
principal payments due on August 1, 2012 and
was in default of such payment. The Company

was able to negotiate payment terms with the
City of North Vernon, Indiana, which allowed the
Company to delay scheduled repayments of the
loan. During the three months ended March 31,
2014 and March 31, 2013, the Company made
$0 and $0, respectively, in payments to the City
of North Vernon for accrued interest.” Q1 2014


Also, here is a quote from an article from the Jamaica
Observer clearly mentioning that Windstream needs
funding to fulfill its Jamaican contract:


“If we are successful in executing this contract
and are able to secure the needed capital to fulfill
this large order, at current rates, this could
potentially result in greater than US$120 million
of revenue to WindStream,” stated the company
in a notice to shareholders obtained by the
BusinessObserver.”


“This contract calls for US$14.5 million of
products to begin delivery in first quarter of
2014,” stated Windstream about its Jamaica
contract.”


To our knowledge, the company had not filled meaningful
parts of this order during Q1 2014.


3. Working Capital


The CEO stated:


“The Company received a $2 million working
capital line of credit through GBC International
Bank of California.”

https://geoinvesting.com/windstream-rebuttal-to-geoinvesting-report-unimpressive/ 10/14


We are not impressed with this development given that:


The company still has a $1.4 million note that they
have made no payments on
We calculate that the company has raised nearly $3
million (not including warrant or convertible debt
proceeds) since mid-2013, but annual revenue is still
tracking at under $1 million and below 2013 full year
sales based on Q1 2014 results


4. Other Matters


Reverse Merger shares


As we stated in our original WSTI article, 39.6 million
shares were issued to Windstream Technologies to
complete the reverse merger transaction that closed on
May 22, 2013. We were able to identify the whereabouts of
21.5 million shares.


Dan Bates, Founder and current CEO of WSTI, 17.3
million shares.
John Owen, co-founder of WSTI that is no longer with
the company, 4.2 million shares.


That leaves 18 million shares that we think management
should inform investors of their origin to help build
credibility. And this should be easy enough given this
statement from WSTI’s Q1 2014 filing:


“For accounting purposes, this transaction is
being accounted for as a reverse merger and has
been treated as a recapitalization of Windaus
Global Energy, Inc., with WindStream
Technologies, Inc. considered the accounting
acquirer, and the financial statements of the
accounting acquirer became the financial

statements of the registrant. The Company did
not recognize goodwill or any intangible assets in
connection with the transaction. The
39,665,899 shares issued to the
shareholder of WindStream Technologies,
Inc., and its designees in conjunction with the
share exchange transaction have been presented
as outstanding for all periods. The historical
consolidated financial statements include the
operations of the accounting acquirer for all
periods presented.”


We believe that this becomes a very relevant point once a
paid promotional campaign commences on a penny stock.
Maintaining less than 5% ownership is a postulated way to
allow for the sale of stock across multiple brokerage
accounts in P&Ds, without disclosure. We would suggest
that the company disclose who these designees are. We
assume the above quoted passage to mean that “the
shareholder” is Dan Bates:


that Dan received 39.6 million shares and then
transferred some of these shares to other individuals.
that Dan received 17.3 million shares and instructed
how the remaining shares would be dispersed to other
individuals.


Warrants and Options:


We didn’t even talk about the shares directors have/may
receive in the form of options and warrants with ridiculous
exercises prices. It appears that these securities were part
of the reverse merger consideration and could telegraph
investors what these insiders really may think WSTI is
worth and how potentially wealthy they have become. Here
are some Form 3’s that were filed at the end of March
2014:

The Windstream reverse merger was completed on May 22,
2013. The form 3’s indicate that the “date of the event
requiring statement” occurred on May 10, 2013 which begs
us to ask why were the form 3’s filed almost a year later.
Furthermore, the company indicated that there had been
no relationship between it and Windstream (pre-merger).
Refer to the following statement in a Form 8K/A on May 22,
2013:


“WindStream was originally established in 2008
as a California “C” corporation by Daniel Bates
and there was no prior relationship between Mr.
Bates or WindStream or any of its officers or
directors, on one hand, and the Company or any
of its officers or directors, on the other hand.”

5/23/2018 Windstream (WSTI) - WSTI Rebuttal to GeoInvesting Report Unimpressive | GeoInvesting


https://geoinvesting.com/windstream-rebuttal-to-geoinvesting-report-unimpressive/ 13/14


If WSTI is going to respond to our article they should
address all of our findings, as well as the findings
mentioned in the Auspex Research article published
on Seeking Alpha.


What happened to $10 million purchase order from
Brazilian customer?
Who owns 18 million of the 39.6 million shares issued
to complete the WSTI reverse merger?
Did WSTI shareholders sponsor the near $1 million
promotional campaign?
Are the facts in the promotional mailer true or
exaggerated?
Does WSTI need to raise money to fully execute
purchase orders?
VFT Related questions:


Does Adrian James operate Vanguard Financial
Trust?
Has James run promotions on companies in the
past?
When and how did VFT come into possession of
WSTI shares?
Why are VFT shares present in a proxy filing
dated February 13, 2014, but omitted just two
months later in the 10K filed on April 11, 2014?
The VFT form 3 was filed on March 27, yet the
“date of event requiring statement” contained in
the form 3 was August 22, 2013. Why did it take
so long to disclose this event?
The April 2014 proxy indicates that VFT owned
7.8 million shares. Where are the 2.1 million
additional shares coming from to get to the 9.9
million shares disclosed in the form 3 ?
The Company states that VFT is an insider and
thus can’t sell stock.  Please elaborate why VFT
can’t sell its stock.  As we pointed out, it appears
other insiders, CEO, CFO and COO have sold
stock.
