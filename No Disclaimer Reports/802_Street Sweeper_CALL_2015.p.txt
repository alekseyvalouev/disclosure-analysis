MagicJack VocalTec: The Disappearing Business Trick

Summary


CALL suffers from perilous declines in users, activations and app users.


Core consumer market is disrupted by free alternatives, unlimited talk phone plans.


CALL endures a disconnect between consensus, compared against declining
Google Trend searches and revenue trend.


Latest “enterprise initiative” features inexperienced businessman, limited overall
potential.


Terrible consumer reviews persist, focusing on poor customer service.


Any smidgen of magic left in magicJack VocalTec (NASDAQ:CALL) is vanishing quicker
than street magician David Blaine can make a new quarter disappear.


Now the former star of annoying, late-night TV commercials only wishes it could make its
melting core business model reappear.


MagicJack offers a device that is plugged into the computer to allow consumers to make
local or international phone calls for about $40 per year. Its secondary offering is VoIP or
voice over Internet protocol for small or medium enterprises, an area dominated by the
AT&Ts and Verizons of the world.


Though magicJack enjoyed an early out advantage in 2007, the benefits have fallen apart
like a busted magic trick.


After an early, reasonably-upbeat article, PC Magazine revisited magicJack in 2011 and
rated it "fair," adding: "(NYSE:W)hen magicJack debuted, nothing else like it existed. That
isn't the case anymore. In the face of competition, magicJack's poor interface, pushy
attempts to up-sell you, on-screen advertisements for its own product, and general lack of
support make it hard to recommend now."


MagicJack faces numerous issues that make the stock impossible to recommend now,
including:


*Perilous declines in users, activations and app users

*Perilous Declines: Users, Activations


Indeed, magicJack's fraying business model is generating a determined, unrelenting
downturn in active device users and activations. Our charts below uncloak the trend:

Active device users have plummeted 23% in two years, as shown above.

Meanwhile, as shown above, device activations bent in half and then some over two
years.


Let's look at why magicJack's core product is declining so drastically…


*Crowded Consumer Market Gets Disrupted By Free Alternatives, Unlimited Talk
Phone Plans

In the consumer market, magicJack competes with rivals such as Ooma (NYSE:OOMA)
(seven times magicJack's revenue) and Vonage (NYSE:VG) (lower cost, lower churn).


There's an elephant in the room - and it's one big beast: The consumer space is dead.
There is virtually no money to be made there.


Consumers don't want to plunk down a big wad of cash for phone service. They've got
free alternatives, such as:


*WhatsApp


*Facebook


*Viber


*Google Voice


*Skype


So why pay for VoIP when you can get free phone service?


As if that's not enough, monster companies such as AT&T and Verizon have changed their
phone plans. Rather than consumers buying so many minutes, they now get unlimited talk
and text. There's no need to pay magicJack or Ooma.


*Small Businesses, Big Targets, Tiny R&D


So now, all the companies like magicJack are talking up their enterprise initiatives.


But it's hard for magicJack to woo small and medium sized businesses because it just
doesn't have much of a research and development budget. Look how small it is, compared
to three rivals.

*HoteliJack: Limited Prospects


Indeed, in the recent earnings call, company leaders talk up their enterprise initiative
called "HoteliJack."


MagicJack partnered with a hotel-related group in an attempt to encourage low cost hotels
to switch phone systems to magicJack-type systems.


"Let me turn to the enterprise initiative we discussed on our last call," said CEO Gerald
Vento during the last earnings call. "In September, we signed a 10-year exclusive
agreement with Hoteligent and the Patel family."


But the online presence of HoteliJack is modest:

And the site seems to focus on promoting the young entrepreneur who may be just cutting
his teeth and hoping for a halo effect from magicJack, according to an audio interview:


Host: "I want to know a defining moment of your career …"


Kunal Patel: "It's been a relatively new career… Thus far it's got to be this partnership with
magicJack. They have 2.7 million consumers on their side and they are a publicly traded
company. Just to get a deal done with magicJack that both is solvent for us, the hotels and
magicJack is an extraordinary time for us."


*More Declines: Key App Users Fall


Surprisingly, along with core deterioration, harsh reviews, declining active device users
and apparently limited prospects of HoteliJack (who wants to use a hotel room phone,
anyway?), the company is also experiencing problems with what should be a promising
category: Unique mobile app users.


And nobody wants to talk about it.


Referring to the unique app users number noted by an analyst during the second quarter
conference call, CFO Jose Gordo said, "I think going forward we'll probably continue to
disclose it, but we see it as less relevant."

But magicJack apparently then decided to take the head-in-the-sand approach. In the third
quarter conference call, the CFO had this to say when an analyst asked about the app
user numbers:


"We made the point a while ago that the growth initiatives as far as the app goes, or even
enterprise or international, were not going to be material in 2015. We think it's too early to
disclose metrics."


Investors may take a look at the user numbers, shown below.

So the chart reveals why company leaders don't want to discuss unique app users.


*Declining Revenue Mirrors "Google Trend" Search Decline


Finally, the chart below shows the disconnect between Google Trend lines, year-over-year
quarterly revenue declines and analysts' unrealistic consensus (shown by the bars) for
magicJack revenue. For comparison, Ooma is shown in brown.
