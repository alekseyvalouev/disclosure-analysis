levels near $10. In our full report, we touch on the
following red flags about the embattled cosmetics and
fragrance company:


RDEN’s dependence on celebrity fragrances comes at
a terrible time, when the over-saturated fragrance
industry is shifting to designer brands and quality over
celebrity names.
We believe that many of the licenses that RDEN owns
for fragrances are for celebrities and designers whose
peak fame is years behind them.

much closer to an insolvency scenario than the
numbers make it look.

company’s debt could be forecasting more tumultuous
results when RDEN reports in mid-August.
Based on the average of numerous valuation
scenarios, we believe RDEN shares could have 52%
downside, alongside risk of a bankruptcy/insolvency
