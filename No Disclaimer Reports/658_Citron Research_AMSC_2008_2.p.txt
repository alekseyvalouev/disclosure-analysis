News Flash — Update — June
13, 2008
In behavior normally reserved for penny stock
promotions, the CEO of AMSC sold $11 million in
stock — around 250,000 shares — most of which
was on the day of AMSC’s questionable press
release. Selling into this volume, yet before release
of the 8-K with the contract details, is deceptive
business practice at its worst. 
The questions about this deal have been best
pointed out in numerous analyst reports, who raise
the obvious doubts about the viability of this
contract.


Sinovel’s (AMSC’s Chinese
counterparty) willingness to commit
to a multi-year forward-year, �xed
price deal — completely inconsistent
with how Chinese companies are
doing business with foreign suppliers.
Citron notes that at least three large-
scale industrial Chinese competitors
will be mass-producing electrical
subsystems for wind turbines by
2009. AMSC has historically won no

more than a “right of refusal” to
supply components on a competitive
basis when it licensed a design. This
design is sourced from competitor
Furhlander.


How Sinovel can absorb 7500 units of
electrical components (which exceeds
by a factor of 3 Sinove’ls projected
capacity to produce turbines) when it
doesn’t have supply agreements on
the other turbine components, such
as blades, towers, bearings, and hubs
all of which are seriously supply
constrained.


There’s nothing in this agreement
that compels Sinovel’s speci�c
performance, or stipulates
cancellation penalties, yet explicitly
grants Sinovel the right to change
which sizes of units they are buying.
This appears to transfer all the
execution risk to AMSC, leaving us to
wonder whether it is in fact a
purchase order by FASB rules, or in
reality just a MOU.


Sinovel’s inability to �nance the $10
billion project pricetag of this massive
number of turbines. (Citron
understands that Sinovel’s parent
Dalian may have �nancial issues of its
own, and may be preening for an IPO
to raise capital.)


No mention of the fact that 17% of
the blockbuster purchase order is a
VAT tax – a fact conveniently left out
of the PR – and overlooked by
analysts — that will surely put their
pricing model on a diet.


All of which makes us wonder: How long will
AMSC bene�t by the street’s misperception that it

is even in the “wind turbine” manufacturing
business, much less a “pure play”? In fact, AMSC
manufactures commodity electrical components for
wind systems, which comprise no more than about
5% of completed wind farm projects, are not in
short supply. It also licenses turbine designs, which
numerous Chinese competitors are moving with
remarkable speed to design independently of
foreign licensors.


Cautious investing to all.

“If You Add to The Truth, You Subtract
From It”… The Talmud


It is no secret that Citron Research is skeptical of
American Superconductor. The company has now
crossed the line to ridiculous. They have taken a
small customer in Sinovel and added so much
nonsense that they have subtracted any corporate
credibility that is still left from a company that has
done nothing but burn through investors money. It
is our opinion that anyone on Wall Street would
have to be deaf, dumb and blind not to realize the
complete lunacy of American Superconductor’s
most recent press release.


As management continues to sell stock at a furious
pace, American Superconductor announced a $450
million order from Sinovel that is supposed to be
used to support more than 10 Gigawatts of power
by the end of 2011. This is on top of their current
$100+ million “backlog” to the same customer.


To explain how crazy this press release was, Citron
refers to the largest wind power purchase order in
the world, which was just publicly announced by T.
Boone Pickens. Pickens, with General Electric, plans
to build a farm for 4,000 megawatts (4 Gw) that is
planned in 4 phases for ultimate completion in
2014. This project has been publicized all around
the world in every language imaginable.

Now we are supposed to believe that American
Superconductor just received an order for 10 Gw to
be delivered by 2011. That is 2 ½ times the size of
the Pickens project in a time span that is half the
time. Yet, nowhere in any language do we see an
order awarded to Sinovel that would support
anything close to this.


This order cannot live in a vacuum. Nowhere can
we read of the: funding, the customers, or suppliers
of other components that are essential to wind
turbines, such as gearboxes, generators, blades,
bearings, cast hubs or towers, which comprise
80%-90% of the cost of a wind unit. We are to
believe that every other customer involved in this
deal has decided not to put out any press.


AN ORDER OF THIS SIZE WOULD BE THE LARGEST
ORDER FOR WINDPOWER IN THE HISTORY OF THE
WORLD …. BUT WE CAN READ ABOUT IT ONLY IN
ONE PLACE: AN AMSC PRESS RELEASE.


Not to carry on but let’s look at how ridiculous this
really is. General Electric is one of the top 5 largest
companies in the world. When they received an
order for 1,000 MW of wind power they put out a
PR.

Sinovel is a small company that did not even put
out a pr when they got an order more than 10x that
size…guess they didn’t want anyone to get “wind of
it”.

The Pickens project is supposed to cost up to $12
billion for all 4 Gw, therefore using the same math
this Sinovel project would cost up to $30 billion in
the next 3 years. Where is the �nancing for $30
billion in wind projects? Is it contingent on
anything? What a great job Sinovel has done at
keeping this secret.


Let’s Get One Thing Straight.


American Superconductor DOES NOT manufacture
wind turbines. They make a power controller and
electrical components that are commodities in the
wind power business. They are low margin items in
a highly competitive industry, and among the only
components in wind turbines not facing signi�cant
logistics and supply constraints. So any order for
electrical components from AMSC should be
matched with orders for essential components
necessary to complete wind turbine projects.


ANALYZING THE PR


Let us look at the headline of this tremendous pr,
“AMSC receives $450 million follow on order from
China’s Sinovel Wind.”


http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080610/20080610005242.html?.v=
[https://biz.yahoo.com/bw/080610/20080610005242.html?.


First thing we notice is the company refers to their
customer as Sinovel Wind. That is funny because
the real name of the customer is Sinovel Windtec.
http://www.sinovel.com/ [http://www.sinovel.com/]


The PR mentions no delivery schedule, no
minimums, no cancellation fees. What happens if
AMSC makes all of these power controllers and
then Sinovel decides in two years they can buy
them cheaper in China? Considering the prices of
these systems is not going up and soon they will be
manufactured by local Chinese companies,
shouldn’t that be a concern for AMSC?


*notice on the bottom of the Sinovel website they
admit themselves that they have a maximum
capacity of 1000 units…strange considering today’s
PR announced orders to “support” 9,0000 units.
Better yet, on the bottom left of the website written

http://citronresearch.com/american-superconductor-you-have-to-read-it-to-believe-it/ 6/9


in Chinese (the blue writing) it says “website under
construction”. If you are going to build the biggest
wind system in the world how about �rst making a
website.


Yes, the customer shares the same name as the
AMSC subsidiary Windtec. As suggested by Citron in
the past, this is somehow a related party
transaction as these companies are joint ventured.
That has not only been mentioned by Citron, but
their joint venture has also been commented on in
industry press. In an article in Modern Power
Systems only two weeks ago referred to the Sinovel
Windtec as a joint venture 3x in the same article.
Something just isn’t right.


So if they are selling 9,000 systems to Sinovel, who
is their next largest customer? This is a tie — there
are two customers who have each bought 20
systems each.

It’s in the numbers … NOT.


A critical glance at AMSC’s 10-K leaves more
questions than answers, as every accounting reg
�ag jumps out.

$15.5 million in “unbilled receivables”


Zero allowance for doubtful accounts


And our favorite is the recording of revenue on a
cost of completion basis.


Between the unusual gross margins and issues with
the warranty accrual, the 10-K deserves its own
report.

A Closer look at Sinovel


An examination of Sinovel’s �nances and the
AMSC’s acquisition of Windtec make it very clear
how unlikely it is that a multi-billion dollar wind
turbine deal (an arms-length one at that) has grown
out of the ground in less than 18 months.


As of Dec 31, 2006, these numbers appear in
Sinovel’s D&B:

Pro�t net of Taxes 48.9 thousand


In early 2007, AMSC acquired Windtec, and by
September 2007, Sinovel had placed orders worth
$90 million with AMSC. Assuming that the electrical
subsystem components supplied by AMSC
comprise 5% of completed wind turbine
installations, this would have represented $1.8
billion in deliverable wind turbine commitments.


Investors are due an explanation as to how this
bonanza comes into being.


Is there an undisclosed �nancial
relationship between Sinovel and
Windtec, which requires restating all
these transactions?
Are these fungible orders according
to US GAAP – where are the funds
necessary to pay for this magnitude
of purchase?
What about announcement of the
projects – which would clearly be the
world’s largest wind projects,
including location and funding
disclosures and timeframes?
Are �rm commitments in place for
the blades, bearings, gearboxes,
castings/hubs, and towers, all supply
constrained components, which are
necessary to ful�ll these contracts?


Insider sales


A relentless drumbeat of insider share sales – over
500,000 shares in just the last 60 days – completes
the picture. CEO, Directors, CTO … if things are so
great, it sure makes you wonder why all the o�cers
are running to the bank.
