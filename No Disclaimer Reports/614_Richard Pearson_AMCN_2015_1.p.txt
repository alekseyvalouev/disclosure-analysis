AirMedia Doubles On Misleading Investment Transaction
Apr. 28, 2015 9:40 AM ET16 comments

Summary


AirMedia has more than doubled in the past few weeks based solely on a supposed
“investment” by A share company Shenzhen Liantronics.


AirMedia did not disclose the actual contract, but did put out a press release touting
a $500 million valuation.


The real contract reveals that there is no binding deal. In fact, Liantronics has not
even conducted due diligence. Liantronics management has verified key details.


We have seen similar "investment" ploys by NQ Mobile and Pingtan marine which
briefly spiked their stocks before they quickly crashed.


AirMedia should quickly correct back to the $2.00 level from where it started (down
by 50-60%).

Investment overview


Shares of Chinese small cap AirMedia have jumped as much as 150% in the past few
weeks based solely on an announcement that A share listed Shenzhen Liantronics is
taking a 5% stake in an AirMedia subsidiary, valuing the company at $500 million. But
Liantronics is telling a very different story, saying that it hasn't even conducted due
diligence.

Institutional ownership of AirMedia stands at just 8.6%. As we can see from various chat
rooms and Twitter feeds, the main parties boosting the stock are simply headline focused
day traders looking to ride the pop on the "news." There has been no reference to or
analysis on any terms of the supposed deal or even basic analysis of the recently
released annual report.


The stock has largely been hyped by such retail day trader sites such as:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 3/22


AirMedia never disclosed the actual contract, but I have obtained a copy and it shows that
the deal is very unlikely to go through due to unrealistic clauses which are entirely
unachievable. These clauses were deliberately included to protect Liantronics. As a result,
Liantronics has also ensured that it has retained full ability to back out of the deal by
including a "put option."


On Friday, shares of AirMedia plunged by nearly 20% on high volume in pre-market
trading. Traders were left to wonder why. In fact, this was just after the annual report was
released on Friday. Investors who bothered to read it clearly found just slight reference to
just some of the actual proposed terms being described. For investors who read and
understand them, these small references show that the deal basically will not go through
at all. Of greater concern is that the worst of these terms are not even disclosed in the 20F
at all, nor is the actual contract itself.


The point is that AirMedia has no deal.


In fact, we have seen nearly identical "investment deals" in the past for Chinese
companies such as NQ Mobile (NQ) and Pingtan Marine (NASDAQ:PME). After an initial
surge, the stocks cratered each time. The reason was the same: the reality was that there
was simply "no deal."


It is notable that AirMedia had also done a similar "investment" deal in 2013 with a
different supplier by the name of Elec-Tech. That deal (perhaps by coincidence) also
supposedly valued AirMedia at $500 million, but with no lasting effect on the share price
once investors read the actual terms.


Had AirMedia disclosed the actual contract for the supposed Liantronics deal, the
stock never would have risen in the first place. I expect the stock to quickly fall
back to around $2.00 where it began before the misleading press release.


This will become entirely clear below.


Part I: Background of AirMedia


As recently as April 7th, shares of AirMedia Group (NASDAQ:AMCN) were trading below
$2.00, valuing the company at just $100 million. Basically, it was trading at the value of its
cash on hand with no value attributed to the business itself.


As we will see, there are ample reasons for this pessimism towards AirMedia.

AirMedia is in the advertising business in China, placing ad screens on planes and trains
as well as outside of gas stations. The stock took a beating in 2011 because it was in the
same space as China Media Express (former ticker CCME). CCME was in the business of
placing ad screens on intercity buses in China, but it imploded due to fraud when it was
found that many of its screens simply did not exist. AirMedia's stock remained distressed
for the past four years and never recovered until the past few weeks.


AirMedia has lost money every year for the past 5 years and revenues continue to plunge
every year. The company recently gave partial guidance that results were set to continue
their downward slide, repeatedly citing "a soft advertising market" as the cause for
ongoing declines.


In April 2015, the company announced that it had obtained concession rights to provide
WiFi service on low speed ("ordinary") trains on the Shanghai line as well as on high and
low speed trains in Jinan. The problem is that AirMedia is not making any money off of
WiFi.


In the Shanghai press release, AirMedia had noted that it already had substantial
involvement in WiFi:

5/22/2018 AirMedia Doubles On Misleading Investment Transaction - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 5/22


Before obtaining the aforementioned concession right, AirMedia was granted
concession rights to install and operate Wi-Fi systems on the high-speed trains
operated by Beijing Railway Bureau, Shanghai Railway Bureau and Guangzhou
Railway (Group) Corporation, with which AirMedia established a leading position in
Wi-Fi services on high-speed trains in China, in terms of the number of high-speed
trains on which it has concession rights to operate on-train Wi-Fi systems. In
addition, AirMedia also holds the concession rights to install and operate Wi-Fi
systems on ordinary trains operated by Xinjiang Railway Bureau.


What you need to know: Despite already operating on some of the largest railways
in China during 2014, we can see from the annual 20F report that this WiFi business
has so far generated so little revenue that it is not even broken out for financial
reporting purposes.


For anyone who has reviewed the Q&A most recent conference call, it should be clear that
company does not yet have a coherent strategy to monetize the WiFi on trains idea, even
though they continue to bid on more and more concessions.


So the first point is that this business has generated minimal revenues so far, even
though it requires large concession payments. The second point is that around 80% of
the company's business continues to be comprised of providing advertising on screens in
airports (WiFi is still a negligible business).


Airport advertising is AirMedia's primary business and it is why AirMedia loses so much
money. This just so happens to be the money losing business in which Shenzhen
Liantronics is supposedly going to invest. (Note: these financials become very important
when viewing the contract below.)


AirMedia has also tried to divest itself of its worst money losing units, but these were so
also minor in size that they do not move the needle much in terms of achieving overall
profitability. This should also be clear to anyone who has read the recent annual 20F
report.


AirMedia has seen significant turnover in CFOs, reporting the resignation and replacement
of its CFO nearly every year for the past 5 years. In 2011 (just after the implosion of China
Media Express), the entire finance team quit at once. AirMedia had disclosed that "During
the year ended December 31, 2011, we experienced turnover in the chief financial officer,
the financial controller, and the financial reporting director and other key positions within
the accounting and financial reporting department."

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 6/22


The point of all of this is simply that there are ample reasons why the stock has
historically traded simply at cash value, with investors attributing no value to the
underlying business.


Part II: The pump on AirMedia - stock doubles within days


On April 8th, AirMedia's stock jumped by more than 40%, suddenly trading nearly $40
million in volume when it announced that Shenzhen Liantronics would invest $25 million
for a 5% stake in an AirMedia subsidiary. As pointed out by AirMedia, this would imply a
value for the entire company at RMB 3 billion (equivalent to approx. $500 million).


Liantronics (SHE:300269) is a US$2 billion market cap company listed on China's A share
market. The company manufactures LED advertising displays.


Chinese brokerage firm Sinolink Securities was quick to add fuel to the fire, speculating
that Liantronics was angling to buy the remaining 95% of the company and that the
implied price would be US$8-10. AirMedia quickly jumped by an additional 50%.


It is this speculation (that the entire company will be bought out at $8-10) that has
been the biggest cause for the spike in the share price.


As a result of the continued speculation, AirMedia have spiked even further. The shares
have now more than doubled and have hit 5-year highs.


At the current price, AirMedia is valued at nearly $300 million. This is more than double its
recent levels, but still only around half of the "implied" investment value as stated by
AirMedia and Sinolink. Retail day traders who are buying into AirMedia still clearly see it
as an implied double from here.


Key investment thesis


AirMedia will quickly fall by at least 50-60% back to its original level of around $2.00.


What is important to note here is that AirMedia only put out a simple press release touting
the headline "investment" terms by Liantronics. AirMedia did NOT actually disclose the
actual contract with Liantronics. Even in the recent 20F filing, the actual contract (which, if
real, should have certainly been deemed to be material) has not been disclosed.


There is only an "equity pledge agreement" where Liantronics is not even a signatory.
Again, Liantronics has not signed this agreement as disclosed by AirMedia.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 7/22


More importantly, the equity pledge agreement shown by AirMedia does not include the
key terms of the actual contract. It is these key terms that virtually ensure that there will be
no deal for the AirMedia subsidiary and that gives Liantronics the right to take back all of
its money.


The most important point here is that had AirMedia disseminated the full contract
allowing investors to see the real terms of the deal, the stock never would have
risen in the first place.


At best, this transaction may provide a short-term loan to AirMedia which must
quickly be repaid. At worst, the money will never be transferred in the first place


Part III: How do I know the investment by Liantronics is a sham ?


First, because I found a copy of the actual contract via Liantronics. Second,
because I actually spoke with Liantronics to get the real information.


The actual contract has not been disseminated in English so no one seems to have found
it yet. The research by Sinolink makes no reference to these actual terms and only refers
to the press release from AirMedia.


For easy reference, readers can flip to the bottom of the contract to see that it is indeed
signed by Shenzhen Liantronics and that the date is April 7th, 2015. This is the same date
as the announcement by AirMedia and is the same date as specified on AirMedia's vague
"equity pledge agreement."


Here is a copy of the Chinese version of the contract from Liantronics.


Here is a copy of the translated version of the contract.


For those who wish to double check, they can also use Google Translate to verify.


Point #1: The inclusion of nonsense conditions means that the deal will never
happen


Note: Within the contract, the parties are specified as follows:


Party A：Beijing Shengshi Lianhe Advertising Co. Ltd i.e. the transferor


甲方: 北京盛世联合广告有限公司


Party B： Shenzhen Liantronics Co. Ltd


乙方: 深圳市联建光电股份有限公司

Party C：AirMedia Advertising Group Co. Ltd


丙方: 航美传媒集团有限公司


In order for the investment to go through, the contract specifies that the AirMedia
subsidiary earn an AUDITED PROFIT in 2015 of RMB 200 million. That is equal to
approximately US$31 million. If this does not happen, then Liantronics simply gets its
"investment" back plus a 10% annual cost of funds fee.


Readers may wish to pause for a moment now and start frantically hitting the sell
button.


Because the odds of the sub earning a profit of $31 million are basically zero. It was a
"nonsense" condition that was included because it simply allows Liantronics to back out.


It is also worth noting that because the requirement is for AUDITED numbers for 2015,
any investment from Liantronics could not even be finalized until after that audit is
complete sometime in 2016.


Perhaps of greatest importance is the fact that nearly 50% of the concessions which will
be placed into the subsidiary EXPIRE by the end of 2015. This is why Liantronics
structured the deal the way they did. Again, this is of key importance. Because it shows
that once Liantronics does complete due diligence, there will simply be no way for
AirMedia to earn a profit of $31 million.


In the contract, it is noted that the "basis for pricing" was the net profit of RMB 200 million
(equivalent to US$31 million)


The Basis for pricing：is according to Party C's 100% stock right, which after the
promised audit comes up to a net profit of RMB 200,000,000 in 2015.


In Chinese:


2、定价依据:以丙方100%股权在2015年承诺的经审计的扣非后的净利润2亿元为定价依据


It is also specifically noted that in the event that the transaction is deemed null and void,
then Liantronics must be paid back the entire investment plus 10% annualized cost of
funds.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 9/22


Should the authorized decision maker of Party A or Party B regards this transaction
null and void due to non-compliance with the decision-making process or other legal
reasons, Party A must pay RMB150,000,000 to Party B within 5 working days
receiving the notice for repurchasing Party C's 5% equity, as well as pay Part B 10%
of the annual cost of the capital as the payment for the use of the funds, from the
very next day when Party A receives the full amount of the transaction under this
agreement until the repurchase of the share is completed.


In Chinese:


如本次交易被甲方或丙方有权决策机构因未履行决策程序或其他法定事由 而认定为无效的,
则甲方需在收到乙方通知后的5个工作日内以人民币1.5亿元现 金回购乙方购买的丙方5%的
股权,并按照10%的年资金成本向乙方支付资金占 用费,占用期为甲方收到本协议下全部交易
金额的次日至股权回购完成日。


AirMedia has lost money 5 years running. That much is obvious. But we can see by
looking at total revenues and concession fees that the sub business can't possibly earn
this much profit (if, in fact, there is even ANY profit at all).


AirMedia disclosed during its March conference call that


AirMedia currently expects its net revenue for the first quarter of 2015 to range from
US$53 million to US$56 million…… AirMedia currently expects its concession fees
to be approximately US$45 million in the first quarter of 2015.


There are two points here. First, revenues are declining significantly. In Q4 last year,
AirMedia did $65 million in revenues, so they will show sequential decline of around 15%.


Second, we can see that GROSS profit for the entire business, including all of the airport
advertising and including the other advertising and WiFi businesses comes to just $10
million per quarter. And this is before SG&A and all other operating expenses. In Q4,
SG&A alone ran at $15 million (more than all projected gross profit).


In 2014 (the full year), the GROSS profit of the entire company was just $16.6 million.
Selling and marketing alone amounted to $25 million while G&A expenses ran at $26
million. Again, EACH of these is well more than the gross profit for the entire company. For
the full year, operating losses amounted to $35 million. After adjustments, net losses still
came to $26 million.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 10/22


The point is that Liantronics set an unobtainable hurdle of RMB 200 million (US$31
million) in profit. It is a win-win for Liantronics. If the sub was somehow able to earn this
much money, then it would indeed be a great deal for Liantronics. If not, Liantronics simply
gets its money back.


What is important to note here is that because of the "put option" described below,
AirMedia cannot even use any of the supposed investment money because Liantronics
has the right to call all of the money back, plus interest.


To the extent that any money can in fact be received, it is nothing more than a
short-term loan (pending due diligence) that cannot be used because of the
redemption feature.


Point #2: There are two built in "put options" to make sure the deal doesn't go
through


So here is where it gets worse.


Just to be sure that no money permanently changes hands, Liantronics and AirMedia also
specified that there had to be a two built in "put options."


The first put option belongs to AirMedia and it says that in the event that AirMedia finds
any different investor within 75 days, then it can simply give Liantronics back its money
and cancel the deal.


This is important because it shows that Liantronics is clearly not determined to "buy the
remaining 95%" as stated by Sinolink. In fact, Liantronics does not seem to even be very
determined to purchase this initial 5%. No party who had any serious intention of buying
5% of a target would allow the target to simply cancel at its own discretion and sell to
someone else.


Had Liantronics actually intended to secure a full stake in the AirMedia sub, they would a)
not have allowed the investment to be called away from them and b) demanded some sort
of right of first refusal or option on an additional stake.


But because Sinolink has not seen the actual terms, they are unaware of any of this and
have therefore speculated that Liantronics will buy the entire company for $8-10.


The second (more important) put option belongs to Liantronics and it says that even after
75 days, if Liantronics wants its money back, then Liantronics can simply cancel the deal.


This language for the two put options can be found here in a "follow up arrangement":

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 11/22


The follow-up arrangement：Within 75 calendar days from the date of Party B's
cash payment, Party C shareholders can choose to sell Party C's equity to a third
party investors. However Party C must notify Party B promptly, and after 5 working
days after the issuance of the notice Party A will pay Party B RMB150,000,000 to
repurchase the 5% equity Party B bought from Party C, as well as pay Party B 10%
of the annual cost of the capital as the payment for the use of the funds, from the
very next day when Party A receives the full amount of the transaction under this
agreement until the day when the repurchase of the share is completed. 75 calendar
days after Party B completes cash payment, Party A has no right to request
redemption of Party C's 5% equity bought by Party B, unless Party B requests
Party A's repurchase. Should such circumstance occurs, Party A must pay
RMB150,000,000 to Party B within 5 working days receiving the notice for
repurchasing Party C's 5% equity, as well as pay Part B 10% of the annual cost of
the capital as the payment for the use of the funds, from the very next day when
Party A receives the full amount of the transaction under this agreement until the
repurchase of the share is completed.

This is why the stock plunged by nearly 20% on Friday
5/22/2018 AirMedia Doubles On Misleading Investment Transaction - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 12/22


The 20F which came out on Friday had a single paragraph which made reference to the
fact that the deal could be cancelled at will. Even though the 20F makes no reference to
the $31 million profit condition, this was enough to spook some investors. The stock
plunged to nearly $4.00 from $5.00 in pre market trading on hundreds of thousands of
shares.


Yet it remains the case that most investors have not figured this out and still think that the
deal is "on."


Here is that paragraph.


In April 2015, Shengshi Lianhe entered into an agreement with Liantronics to
transfer to Liantronics 5% equity interest in AM Advertising for RMB150 million.
Liantronics agrees to make payments for the transfer after the change in AM
Advertising's equity ownership is duly registered in government records. Before such
change registration, we plan to consolidate certain media business lines under AM
Advertising through internal re-organization. During the period of 75 calendar days
after Shengshi Lianhe receives full payment from Liantronics, or the Waiting Period,
we may elect to sell our equity interest in AM Advertising to third parties, and if we
so elect, Shengshi Lianhe will repurchase such 5% equity interest from
Liantronics for an amount equal to RMB150 million plus applicable fees. The
applicable fees will be calculated as 10% of RMB150 million per annum for the
period from the date on which Shengshi Lianhe receives Liantronics' full payment
through the date on which such repurchase is completed. In addition, if we elect not
to sell to third parties during the Waiting Period, Liantronics may request that
Shengshi Lianhe repurchase such 5% equity interest after the end of the
Waiting Period. Repurchase price in this situation will equal to RMB150 million
plus applicable fees, which will equal to 10% of RMB150 million per annum for the
period from the date on which Shengshi Lianhe receives Liantronics' full payment
through the date on which such repurchase is completed.


Part IV: But what does management at Liantronics have to say?!


In order to gain full clarity on this supposed "investment" and on Liantronics intentions, I
held a conference call with Liantronics's security department regarding the details of the
transaction with AirMedia.


The key points were as follows:



https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1413745/000114420415024774/v406261_20f.htm
5/22/2018 AirMedia Doubles On Misleading Investment Transaction - AirMedia Group Inc (NASDAQ:AMCN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/3109346-airmedia-doubles-on-misleading-investment-transaction 13/22


1. Liantronics has not even conducted any due diligence on AirMedia or its subs.


2. $31 million is the required profit target for the business in 2015 after AirMedia spins
off its gas station media business and airport WiFi business. This is the basis for a
hypothetical $500 million valuation.


3. Liantronics does not know undisclosed financial details of AirMedia and both parties
did not discuss further details.


4. This supposed transaction is entirely still in its initial stage. Even if the deal were to be
eventually closed, based on the agreement between Liantronics and AirMedia, within 75
days after the closing deal, AirMedia has the right to revoke the deal. And after 75 days
after the closing deal, Liantronics still has the right to revoke the deal.


5. In the event that AirMedia cannot finish its spin off and/or cannot meet the net profit
target in 2015, Liantronics may opt to not close this deal and/or revoke this deal even
after its closing.


6. Currently, to Liantronics's best knowledge, AirMedia did not start its spin off process yet
and both sides did not resume the continuing negotiation and/or discussion
regarding the implementation of the transaction yet.


So basically, there had been discussions, but there is no deal. The state of
discussions is so preliminary that Liantronics has not even conducted due
diligence. In short, the terms of the deal itself will basically preclude it from
happening.


Part V: In China, we have seen identical sham investments before


In all fairness, investors should not be surprised to see this type of sham transaction being
used to hype a Chinese small cap. We have seen the same thing repeatedly in the past
when beaten down companies are looking to prop up their stock.


The two recent examples that stick out most notably are with NQ Mobile and Pingtan
Marine.


On May 30th, 2014, NQ Mobile announced that it was selling a minority stake in its FL
Mobile unit to Bison Capital. The headline terms were nearly identical to what we see
with AirMedia.

And oh by the way, Bison Capital (the investor behind the NQ "investment") happens
to be one of the only major investors in AirMedia. Bison also sits on AirMedia's board.
Keep this in mind as you read the details below.


NQ said that it would sell a 5.8% stake for $25 million, which would value the FL unit alone
at $425 million. The news sent NQ's stock soaring by more than 50%, sending it briefly
back above $10.


But (just like the AirMedia deal), there were certain "conditions" to the deal. There was a
"redemption right" (a put effectively) which said that if FL did not complete a qualified IPO
within 12 months then Bison gets its money back.


Within weeks, the market began to understand that the investment was a sham and the
share price plunged by 50%.


That did not stop NQ from trying again in December. In its second attempt, NQ announced
that it was selling 100% of the FL mobile unit for an even greater amount, this time $630
million. But by December, the market wasn't being fooled again.


It has now been nearly 12 months and there is no IPO in sight. NQ (the entire company)
is now valued at just $329 million, with the value of FL mobile being near zero. Just last
week, Omar Khan, the Co-CEO decided to step down from his role at the company.

As shown above, shares of NQ are now down by 60-70% since that time.


With Pingtan Marine (yet another sham investment), the situation was also almost
identical. Pingtan announced in February 2015 that China Agriculture Industry
Development Co was investing $64 million to buy an 8% stake. Pingtan touted that this
valued the company at $800 million and the stock (of course) briefly soared to over
$3.00 and was valued at nearly $300 million (still a considerable discount to $800 million).


But once investors actually evaluated the actual contract and understood the profit
conditions involved, the stock quickly plunged back to lower than where it started.


Pingtan now trades at less than $2.00 and is valued at just $150 million.

In fact, AirMedia itself has done this identical dance before. How did it work out ?


In 2013, AirMedia announced that a company called Elec-Tech was acquiring a 21% stake
on AirMedia's Great View Media subsidiary for $104million. Elec-Tech is a competitor to
Liantronics in the electronic display business.


The acquirer was a supplier to AirMedia. As with the current situation, the implied
valuation was around $500 million for AirMedia.


However, it was then disclosed that 100% of the investment amount from this "investment"
had to be used to simply buy product from the supplier. By year end, 50% of the
investment amount had already been used to buy displays. It is little more than a line of
credit from a supplier.


As disclosed in the 2013 20F,

In May 2013, several entities affiliated with AirMedia, including GreatView Media, the
primary operating entity of our gas station media network, and its then-existing
shareholders, entered into an investment agreement with Elec-Tech International
Co., Ltd., or Elec-Tech. Pursuant to the investment agreement, Elec-Tech agreed to
invest RMB640 million (US$104 million) to purchase ordinary shares representing
approximately 21.27% of the equity interest of GreatView Media. After the
completion of the transaction, AirMedia controls 61.41% of the equity interest of
GreatView Media and the senior management team of GreatView Media indirectly
holds 17.32% equity interest in GreatView Media through Zhongshi Aoyou, which is
wholly owned by the management team. Pursuant to this agreement, the then-
existing shareholders of GreatView Media agreed to cause GreatView Media to
utilize Elec-Tech's contribution for the sole purpose of purchasing LED screens from
Elec-Tech or its subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2013, GreatView Media purchased
1,000 sets of LED screens in total from Elec-Tech for our gas station media business
in the amount of approximately US$57 million.


Despite the completed investment valuing AirMedia at over $500 million, the stock
continued to trade for around $2.00 until this latest "investment" was announced and
promoted in 2015.


The point is that "the devil is in the details." The "investment" by Elec-Tech was also little
more than a loan and in no way justified an increased valuation for AirMedia.


Part VI: Conclusion


The only reason why AirMedia has more than doubled is simply because of a supposed
"investment" by Shenzhen Liantronics which ostensibly values the company at around
$500 million. The supposed investment deal is not what it has been purported to be.


The supposed investment by Liantronics into AirMedia is a sham transaction. It can be
simply cancelled by either party and it is contingent upon AirMedia's subsidiary earning an
impossible profit level. The transaction was deliberately designed so that it would never
end up going into effect and that it could be easily reversed at any time.


This becomes more obvious in light of the fact that nearly 50% of the airport concessions
will expire by the end of 2015.


As a result, there will be no lasting investment. If any proceeds are received by
AirMedia, they will simply be repaid due to failure of the terms required.

Common sense should tell us that the contract is neither certain nor material. If it was,
AirMedia would have been forced to disclose the actual contract itself as an attachment to
the 8K and 20F.


But the market has clearly reacted as if the contract were very real and very material,
adding nearly $200 million in market cap to the company's value within the past 2 weeks.


We have seen identical surges before based on nearly identical sham contracts with
companies such as NQ Mobile and Pingtan Marine. These surges have always shown
violent reversals once investors figure out the real terms of the supposed deals.


So now investors should watch for a rapid reversal in AirMedia's share price, with the
stock quickly headed back to $2.00 from whence it began.


Authors note: Last week I had attempted to discuss these issues with management by
phone prior to publication without success. Shortly before publication, I did receive an
email back from management with answers to several questions. I did not tell them I had a
full copy of the contract or that I had spoken to Liantronics.


Management stated that they are confident that AM Group Co (the subsidiary) can reach
the profit goal of 200 million RMB and that there will be no consequences if they do not.
This appears to contradict both the written contract as well as the statements from
Liantronics, which are consistent with one another.


As to possible cancellation of the transaction, management stated that it has the right for
75 days to sell equity to a third party and cancel the investment from Liantronics. That is
straight out of the contract.


They also pointed out that the investment would be cancelled if it were not paid by
Liantronics within 30 days of the transfer of equity. Again, that is also straight out of the
contract.


However, in terms of Liantronics right to cancel the deal, management simply stated that


"There is no specific terms and conditions under current transaction agreement as to the
conditions when Liantronics will cancel the transaction;".


This statement is inconsistent with both the contract and with statements from Liantronics.
More importantly, it is inconsistent with statements from AirMedia's own 20F filing, which
state that after 75 days Liantronics can require repurchase of the entire investment. This
can be for any reason, (including failure to meet the profit target).
