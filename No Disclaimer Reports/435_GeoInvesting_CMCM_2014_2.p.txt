Summary


Despite being relisted on Google Ranks, GeoInvesting still thinks the company is a
bad investment with an obsolete product.


David continued that not only did Cheetah Mobile fail to make a disclosure, they did
not respond to a direct request.


US investors have been largely unaware for the same reason they were unaware
that the app had been removed until GeoInvesting published its short thesis on July
31.

Shares of Cheetah Mobile (NYSE:CMCM) rose 21.2 percent over the past two days after
the company's Clean Master app was relisted in Google Rankings.


US investors have been largely unaware for the same reason they were unaware that the
app had been removed until GeoInvesting published its short thesis on July 31.
Downloads dropped 88 percent when removed from Google Rankings.


In an exclusive interview with Benzinga, GeoInvesting's Dan David discussed updates
with the stock.


The Story


"What happened subsequently is that they are being ranked again on Google Play," David
said. "What they haven't done is disclose why they weren't ranked from July 14. I think it's
a material omission."


He continued that he is happy that the app is once again listed for Cheetah Mobile's
uniformed US investors.


"Two days ago, they were in the Chinese media letting everybody know, before the market
opened, that they are being picked up by Google Play again."


However, no announcement was made to US investors, leaving them in the dark as
Chinese investors bid the stock higher.
