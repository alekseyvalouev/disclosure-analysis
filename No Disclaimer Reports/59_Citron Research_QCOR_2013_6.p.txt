Questcor in Cover-Up Mode:  Deleting Evidence from its 
Website … BUT Citron Finds the Smoking Gun and Presents it 
Here for the Federal Trade Commission 
 
Investors please don’t read further -- you might find 
something you don’t like. 
 
Over the coming months, Citron Research will release a series of articles on Questcor (NASDAQ:QCOR) 
intended to shed light on probable issues of interest to the multi-pronged investigation underway by 
multiple regulatory agencies into numerous aspects of Questcor’s business strategy that political 
correct-speak would deem “legally challenged”.  These articles will dig deeper into topics such as: 


 The Chronic Disease Fund, and the role it plays in contributing to Questcor’s revenues 


 Medicare billing (it is very dangerous to participate in a scheme to defraud the Federal 
Government)  


 Insurance reimbursement coding for Acthar 
 
Meanwhile, today’s question is whether Questcor’s Synacthen acquisition is anti-competitive.  The 
points raised in Citron’s article last week are relevant to the FTC’s inquiry, demonstrating Questcor’s 
intent to suppress competition by acquiring Synacthen is exposed by their own sell-side analysts.  
 
We are sure that Questcor will now try to posture to the FTC that Synacthen is a completely different 
drug, arguing that while it has similarities, it cannot be regarded as a replacement for HP Acthar Gel.  
This piece of evidence presented below is for the FTC, so shareholders please cover your eyes.   
 
In 2012, when Questcor was just ramping up its nephrology sales initiative, it issued commentary on a 
scientific study it cited on www.acthar.com, which it referenced as the primary study demonstrating 
efficacy for Acthar in treating Nephrotic Syndrome.  It is important to note that sales of Achtar for 
Nephrotic Syndrome, which began in earnest only two years ago, have risen to levels now representing 
35-40% of all sales of Acthar – a sum greater than Questcor’s total revenues as recently as early 2011.  
 
The cover-up here that Questcor does not want you to know (or remember, in the case of Citron) is that 


the referenced study for Nephritic Syndrome specifically stated that Synacthen -- not Achtar was 
the drug used in the trial!  So at that time, Questcor was justifying Acthar’s use for Nephrotic conditions 
specifically because it was a correlate to Synacthen, which wasn’t available in the United States.

Questcor will have to learn the hard way: you cannot rewrite history or deceive the government simply 
by eliminating information from your website.  After this type of cover-up, we can only imagine how 
many emails have been destroyed.   
 


   So look carefully: Questcor claims Acthar lowers proteinuria in 
Nephrotic Syndrome (NS), but in the actual study, “synthetic ACTH analogue” 
e.g. Synacthen is the drug being used!

[ Our gratitude to archive.org for preserving the past in these types of cases.  Over a 13 year span it has 
become an invaluable resource for exposing corporate wrongdoing. – Editor ]  
 
Since Questcor’s bid to acquire the rights to Synacthen for the U.S. and multiple other countries in June 
2013, this page has been removed from the Acthar website.   But it was very much on display in March 
and October 2012.  With Synacthen available for less than $10 a vial, while Acthar is being sold for north 
of $28,000, what conceivable chance is there that the FTC can ignore that this acquisition is inherently 
anti-competitive?  This issue goes right to the heart of  Senator Klobuchar’s request for an FTC 
investigation of this acquisition.  See the full letter here.   
 


   And While the SEC is looking at Questcor, they should look at their online 
mouthpiece as well for REG FD Violations 
 
In late October 2013 after a Barron’s article disclosed to the markets Questcor’s involvement 
with the troubled Chronic Disease Fund, a long-standing and highly questionable relationship at 
that, a sharp Seeking Alpha writer explored this troubled partnership in greater details. 
 
 http://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-free-drug-
truly-free 
 
Nearly instantly after this article was published, online rebuttals were posted from a gentleman 
using the handle of “Pharmaman58”.  This particular poster has been a long-time online 
mouthpiece for Questcor, always claiming he is long the stock, and passionately countering 
arguments of skeptics, often with information that confers on him the authority of “the go-to 
guy” on message boards for Questcor stock on Yahoo, Seeking Alpha, and stock trading 
websites.  Turns out that “Pharmaman58” is none other than Gary Schueler, the President of 
Pharma International in Syracuse.   His company offers market research and web development 
services for … pharmaceutical companies!   http://www.pharma-ii.com/team.html  
 


However, in this particular response about the Chronic Disease Fund, which we now know to be 
a hot-button issue for Questcor, he overplayed his hand.   
 
In this response to the Chronic Disease Fund article, posted just 3 hours after the article’s 
release  ( http://seekingalpha.com/article/1760862-questcor-and-the-chronic-disease-fund-is-
free-drug-truly-free  ) Schueler posted the below comments using language that would appear 
in Questcor’s public SEC filings only eight days later.  Simply put, Gary was quoting out of 
Questcor’s 10-Q  8 days before the Q was filed.  So unless Mr. Schueler writes about Questcor 
with a Ouija board, he was provided with several paragraphs of unpublished 10-Q language -- 
direct from Questcor management -- prior to publication.  


 
Pharmaman58’s most interesting post is on seekingalpha.com is here:

In particular, look carefully at these two paragraphs below:   





Good of him to share the information from Questcor’s SEC filings, doncha think?  The only problem 
is that as of the date of that post, Questcor had never ever written any such 
language in its SEC filings, ever. 
 
This became more interesting when just eight days later, on October 30, 2013, Questcor filed its 10-Q, 
which contained the following paragraphs, disclosure language never previously used:

We provide free vials of Acthar, to support a patient assistance program administered by the National 


Organization of Rare Disorders, or NORD. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, the 


commercial value of Acthar vials provided through this program was approximately $46 million and $130 


million, respectively. This value is based on our selling price at the time vials are provided, though the vials 


are not sold, and we do not recognize any revenue or net sales from this program. 





Separately, we make charitable contributions, in dollars, to the Chronic Disease Fund, which administers 


co-pay assistance programs. For the three and nine months ended September 30, 2013, we contributed 


approximately $3.1 million and $9.0 million, respectively, to the Chronic Disease Fund in support of its co-


pay assistance programs. Amounts provided to the Chronic Disease Fund result in a deduction from our gross 


revenue in the calculation of our net sales. See Item 2. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Results of 


Operations and Financial Condition. 


Pharmaman58: 
“Here is the language from Questcor SEC filings around the CDF and NORD, two not-for-profits the 
company supports: 
 
Questcor provides free vials of Acthar, to support a patient assistance program administered by 
the National Organization of Rare Disorders, or NORD. From September 2007 through June 30, 
2013, the commercial value of Acthar vials provided through this program approximates $360 
million. This value is based on our selling price at the time, though the vials are not sold, and we 
do not recognize any revenue or net sales from this Acthar free drug program. 
 
Separately, Questcor makes charitable contributions, in dollars, to the Chronic Disease Fund, 
which administers co-pay assistance programs. In the quarter ended June 30, 2013, Questcor 
contributed approximately $3.1 million to the Chronic Disease Fund in support of its co-pay 
assistance programs. Amounts provided to the Chronic Disease Fund result in a deduction from 
Questcor¹s gross revenue in the calculation of its net sales, as disclosed in the Management's 
Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition section.”

There is simply no way Gary Schueler could have received the content of the above post without a 
direct relationship to Questcor’s management.  Therefore, he would be required, under SEC rule 10b-5 
and Rule FD, to disclose that relationship, and his position in Questcor’s stock, in each and every post 
he has made on a public forum.    
 


 
 
Enterprising Gary saw an opportunity when Questcor’s MS sales started flattening out, and they began a 
big push on Nephrotic Syndrome conditions to replace them.  As well, we found Gary Schueler posting 
on http://www.nephcure.org … here he is http://www.nephcure.org/blog-pharmaman58 suggesting 
potential patients go search out Acthar as a treatment.  So he’s advocating the drug to potential patients 
as well as the stock to potential investors.  Is he a drug marketing guy, or a stock commentator?  Or 
both?  Does Gary have a financial relationship to the company or does he just have an “inside track”???   
Inquiring minds will want to know … especially those at the SEC.   
 


Conclusion 
 It is Citron’s firm belief that a regulatory noose is tightening around Questcor, and that the company 
and its officers are soon going to find themselves in an unviable position with regard to maintaining the 
cash flow from exploiting Acthar at the questionable fringes of health insurance reimbursement policies.  
Citron thinks the time it will be able to keep Synacthen (a $10 competitor) or another generic version of 
ACTH out of the US the market will be far too short to support the lofty multiples afforded to the stock 
by its cheerleader analysts.  Meanwhile the company has gotten too deeply into bed with some really 
shady characters, and has become far too reliant on reimbursement strategies that may be running 
afoul of laws in multiple Federal jurisdictions, including Federal tax law (especially as it applies to non-
profits), the FTC’s anti-kickback law, as well as the SEC disclosure and FTC anti-monopoly jeopardies 
described above.   
 
And the worst of it may be Medicare billing fraud (to be discussed in later articles).  That one is really, 
really serious – involving criminal liability.   
 
So when the company sends its attorneys to try to intimidate investigators from inquiring into the 
operations of one “Chronic Disease Fund” – the very same entity in the disclosure language published by 
“Pharmaman58” -- before the company even filed its 10-Q …. Well, the whole thing just begins to smell. 
 
Stand by for more.  We’re sure this is not the last word on Questcor.   
 


   Cautious Investing to all.  


By revising the definition in this manner, we provide that the regulation will cover senior 
management, investor relations professionals, and others who regularly interact with securities 
market professionals or security holders.


36
 Of course, neither an issuer nor such a covered person 


could avoid the reach of the regulation merely by having a non-covered person make a selective 
disclosure. Thus, to the extent that another employee had been directed to make a selective 
disclosure by a member of senior management, that member of senior management would be 
responsible for having made the selective disclosure.
