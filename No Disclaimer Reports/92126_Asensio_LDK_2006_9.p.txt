LDK’s Latest Earnings


Announcement Betrays


Findings of Independent


Committee.


In late 2007, LDK Solar Co., Ltd. (“LDK”) announced the


�ndings of an independent audit committee formed to


evaluate criticism of a former employee in connection with


the company’s inventory reporting practices. According to


LDK’s December 17 press release, the committee uncovered


“no material errors in the Company’s stated silicon inventory


quantities.”


It appears that LDK’s most recent �nancial �ling betrays the


�ndings of the committee led by two of its own independent


directors. On February 25, 2008, LDK reported its �nancial


results for the fourth quarter of �scal 2007. On the


unaudited balance sheet released with this earnings report,


LDK now classi�es $29.98 million of its $380 million


inventory as “Inventories to be processed beyond one year.”


During the earnings call, LDK CFO Jack Lai commented on


the inclusion of the mysterious line item:


“based on the manufacturing recipe, we have a limit


percentage of polysilicon powder that can be used in the


production process. So we work on our formula, work on our

production anticipation this year, and some of the inventory


will be going beyond this year.”


According to Lai, LDK is unable to productively use nearly


$30 million worth of polysilicon powder this year. This fact is


remarkably similar to the criticism LDK received from former


employee Charlie Situ in September 2007. The company


does not include any additional disclosures or notes to


describe this inventory or any other item.


In the earnings release, LDK valued its inventories as of


December 31, 2007 at $350.00 million. Including the long


term inventory, LDK boasted an inventory worth $379.98


million. This �gure does not include $157.2 million in pre-


payments to suppliers.


Yet LDK has not released a management-certi�ed, complete


�nancial statement since July 3, 2007. In this 242B4 �ling,


LDK valued its inventories as of December 31, 2006 at $94.9


million.


In the audited �nancial statement, LDK reported total assets


of $292.72 million as of December 31, 2006. One year later,


LDK reported total assets of $1.3 billion. A shift in the


accounting policy employed to capitalize over $1 billion of


expenditures could easily turn LKD’s reported earnings into


huge losses.


Asensio.com believes the �ndings of LDK’s independent


audit committee are questionable. In fact, Asensio.com


recently contacted Simpson, Thatcher and Bartlett LLP in


connection with LDK’s long term inventory. The company


continues to �le earnings reports without including any


notes or discussion. Until LDK’s disclosures improve, it is


impossible to properly evaluate the condition of the


company’s inventories or the level of earnings it reports.
