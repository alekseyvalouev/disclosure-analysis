Energy Investments After The Fall:
Opportunity Or Slippery Slope?


Grant’s Fall 2015 Conference

Energy Complex Upended


• High oil prices and cheap credit 
fuelled ramp in energy 
exploration and production (E&P)
– Shale in the US
– Large Liquefied Natural Gas 


(LNG) projects in Asia, Australia, 
and Africa


• OPEC cracks
– Members have competing 


interests
– Politics pressuring economics


• Tensions rise as budgets are 
under pressure
– Higher breakeven costs for 


government promises
– Social stability at risk

US Shale Revolution


• Shale revolution was a game 
changer
– Crude oil production in the US rose 


by 55% between 2009 and 2014 
– Net crude imports fell by 20% 


between 2009 and 2014
– The US is the world’s largest oil and 


gas producer 


• Production of unconventional wells 
has high initial production followed by 
steep decline rates 
– Wells can see production declines by 


70% in year 1, 50% in year 2, and 
30% in year 3


– Creates need to invest continually in 
order to maintain production levels


• As global supply of oil has outgrown 
demand, oil price has plunged

A Gusher Of E&Ps


• Shale E&P in the US is an 
unconsolidated sector with little control 
over production and pricing
– Largely funded by low Fed rates


• Short term management 
compensation plans are tied to 
production growth
– Return on capital metrics are rare
– Well participation agreements are 


common 


• Public valuations are tied to production 
growth
– Investors relied on NAV and 


EV/EBITDA, both of which are heavily 
dependent on production growth


• Most E&Ps need to spend 120% of 
cash flow to grow production with 
prices between $50-60/bbl

E&Ps Reduced Costs In An Unanticipated Fashion


• High cost US oil was expected to 
cut production to balance the 
market


• Rather than cutting production, 
E&Ps optimized cost per barrel 
and lowered 2015 costs by 30-
50%
– Squeezed service providers
– Retreated to core areas
– Focused on drilling efficiency


• US production is expected to 
grow 6% in 2015 despite a 59% 
drop in the US rig count since 
September 2014


• Production expected to decline 
4% in 2016 at the current strip

US Rig Count Vs. Production
6


E&P Accounting Allows Flexibility


• Widespread use of full-cost accounting
– While drilling and completion is always capitalized, businesses vary in how 


aggressive they are in capitalizing costs
– Drilling and completion, exploration, unsuccessful drilling/exploration efforts, 


gathering and transport, G&A and interest expenses can all be capitalized
– Allows E&Ps to defer depreciation of capitalized costs associated with 


unproven reserves
– Flatters EBITDA and leverage ratios


• Due to the variation in capitalization policies across businesses, it is 
important to know how aggressive the policy is when evaluating cash 
costs and margins
– It is equally important to watch out for changes in policy


• GAAP reserve testing and PV-10 methodology in a deflationary price 
environment can lead to overstated reserves and valuations
– Assumed selling price for all reserves is based on a trailing twelve month 


average (1st day of each month) 
– Cost structure used in reserve tests reflect current cost environment
7


E&Ps Squeezed


• US oil and gas supply currently cannot tap global demand
– Despite price declines, production continues
– Federal approvals for exporting limited quantities of US oil and petroleum 


products are beginning


– E&P company executives are lobbying Congress to lift the export ban on crude
• High yield producers are challenged to fund capex in a low price oil 


environment
– Equity issuance decreased to $1.8B in 3Q15 from $7.4B in 1Q15
– Debt issuance decreased to $4.0B in 3Q15 from $12.8B in 1Q15
– Small and medium-sized E&P company liquidity is dependent on reserve-


based credit facilities and borrowing bases are expected to drop as much as 
15% in October 20151


– The weakest companies are starting to collapse under the weight of debt, as 8 
bankruptcies have been announced in YTD15 vs. 3 bankruptcies between 2012 
and 2014

E&Ps Do Not Generate Cash


• Leading E&P companies show 
fallacy of shale economics
– Cash flow from operations has not 


covered capex since 2010
– Return of capital is funded by debt, 


asset sales, and equity
– Leverage levels have increased 


across the industry
• Investors focused on production 


growth, not returns
– Economic returns are not as high as 


believed 
– Forward estimates show significant 


decline in returns
• Despite significant investment, 


proved reserves have not grown 
meaningfully for most companies


• E&Ps benefit from tax deferrals as 
long as drilling continues

Liquidity Analysis Might Come Back In Vogue


• Traditional signs of balance sheet stress 
paint a dire picture


– Current and quick ratios routinely below 1.0x
• Low cash on balance sheets matters


– Investors no longer interested in funding 
capex in excess of cash flow


• High yield energy market is stretched and 
issuers are becoming increasingly 
constrained by covenants


– Traditional source of E&P capital
– Energy spreads are 480 bps wider than 


average high yield spreads


– Unused revolver capacity key to current ratio 
covenant compliance


• Energy bulls cite revolver capacity and 
distant financing maturities as reason to 
ignore depleted balance sheets

Is Bank Liquidity A Mirage?


• Banks of all sizes are increasingly vocal 
about their concerns with the energy sector


– Significant YTD reserve building, with 
negative credit migration expected to continue


– Emphasizing active engagement with 
borrowers and increased regulatory scrutiny


• Seemingly benign revolver redeterminations 
are accompanied by less publicized 
covenant adjustments


– A major Wall Street bank modified 72 out of 
74 loans in its oil and gas book1


• Even “best-in-class” E&Ps are reluctant 
to tap revolvers
– Despite $2.3B of revolver availability, CXO 


decided to issue $794M of equity


• Return to growth cannot happen without 
cheap equity and debt, neither of which exist 
today

Big Oil Is Pumping Negative Cash Flow


• Cash flow after distributions is 
negative
– Distributions support stock price
– Growing debt funding the gap
– Buybacks starting to be curtailed


• Paying more for less
– Big 51 production has declined 12% 


to 5,502mboe in 2014 from 
6,235mboe in 2010


– Costs per barrel increased 82% to 
$29.6/bbl in 2014 from $16.2/bbl in 
2010


• Replacing less reserves at a higher 
cost
– Costs per organic barrel addition is 


up almost 4x to $35.1/bbl in 2014 
from $9.5/bbl in 2009


– Reserve replacement ratio was 76% 
in 2014, the lowest level since 2007

More LNG Projects Coming Online


• Global LNG supply/demand balance 
now unfavorable for producers
– Global capacity to increase to 400Mt 


in 2018 from 290Mt in 2013
– Bulls argue insufficient supply 


constrained demand after the past 3 
years of stagnant growth


• Major projects coming online
– Australia has $180B invested in top 6 


projects bringing 53Mtpa online over 
the next two years


– US LNG exports to begin in 4Q15
– ExxonMobil and Total ramping 


production in Papua New Guinea
• North American proposed projects

LNG Market Deteriorating 


• Japan Korea Marker benchmark 
currently below $7/mmBtu, down 
55% in the last year
– Project economics dependent on 


double-digit LNG prices
– Prices have lag effect from crude and 


are projected to drop further
– Shift towards spot pricing will be 


more favorable to buyers who once 
relied on long-term contracts


• Buyers asking for lower prices on 
long-term “fixed price” contracts


• Japanese LNG demand will decline
– Full nuclear restart may take 30Mtpa 


of demand out of Japan by 2030

Are LNG Contracts Indestructible? 


• Most contracts are not publicly disclosed
• Petronet breaks contract with Qatar


– It is cheaper purchase spot cargoes and 
pay $1.4B upfront fee than pay for the 
agreed-upon volume and price


– Contract was in year 11 out of 25
– Only willing to take 70% of agreed-upon 


volumes, when the minimum was 90%
• Shell CEO says long-term LNG contracts 


have pricing formulas reviewed every 3 to 
6 years


– 85 to 90% of Shell’s LNG contracts are 
long-term (2 or more years)


– Growing concern that Chinese regulators 
may ask for changes in LNG contracts or 
asset sales to approve BG takeover


• Japanese buyers showing unwillingness to 
take test batches of LNG from new 
projects in Australia


• Qatar, the largest supplier of LNG, no 
longer opposed to making changes to 
existing contracts

Shell’s $70B Bet On LNG And Brazil


• Shell pays 50% premium to acquire BG 
Group, a restructuring story focused on 
LNG and Brazil


– Bull oil case of $110/bbl, base case of 
$90/bbl


– Pro-forma a more levered entity with 
$68B of net debt and declining cash 
flow


• An expensive solution to aid struggling 
legacy upstream portfolio


– Shell proved reserve replacement ratio 
of 26% in 2014, the lowest of the Big 5 
since 2010


– Production rates declined 11% to 
2.7Mboe/d in 2Q15 from 3.1Mboe/d in

The Dream Of The Combined Shell And BG


• Greater production
– Total production expected to increase 


15% by 2020 to 4.3Mboe/d
– Brazil deep water production 


expected to account for nearly all 
growth in oil production


• Growing cash flows
– CFFO to increase to $53B in 2020 


from $43B once the deal closes in 
2016


– $2.5B in synergies by 2018
• Higher distributions


– Annual dividends raised to $15B from 
$12B in combined pro-forma 2014


– $25B in buybacks between 2017-
2020 driven by oil price recovery


• $30B in asset sales between 2016 
and 2018 to offset incremental debt

Shell’s Brazil: Risk Masquerading As Opportunity


• Shell production growth dependent 
on Brazil
– Shell estimates Brazil will account for 


20% of total production by 2020 up 
from less than 10% currently


– Nearly all of BG’s oil-related growth 
projects are in partnership with 
Petrobras


• The price of corruption
– Shell CEO confident Brazilian pre-


salt assets will be profitable despite 
risk of delays


– Timing of floating production, 
storage, and offloading (FPSO) 
vessel delivery uncertain


• The Eike Batista Experience
– Are all the reserves there?
– The promise of production does not 


always materialize

Cheniere Energy

Cheniere’s Dream


• Annual EBITDA of $4.1B from 9 trains
– Baseline cash flows are guaranteed on 20-year “take or pay” contracts
– Cash flows from liquefaction fees will easily cover construction costs and pay off debt
– Uncontracted volumes will find buyers who will pay liquefaction fees of $3.50/mmBtu
– Buyers are responsible for shipping to end users, so demand is locked in
– 100% utilization rate at all times


• LNG capacity from Sabine Pass and Corpus Christi will total 40Mtpa
– Equivalent to 10% of the global market by 2020


• No commodity pricing risk gives Cheniere an unique position in the LNG market
– Other producers are responsible for producing gas that feeds into LNG projects, thus 


there are minimal capex requirements once the projects are online
– Sales agreements are indexed to 115% of Henry Hub, which is cheap relative to gas 


prices elsewhere
– Liquefaction costs only $1/mmBtu but fees range between $2.25-3.50/mmBtu


• Activist involvement will manage cost base more efficiently
– Icahn raises stake to 12% from 8% and granted two seats on the board


• Cost to build LNG facilities are at a fraction of Australian projects
• First US exporter of LNG beginning in 4Q15
Source: Company filings, Goldman Sachs, Raymond James
21


Cheniere Reality


• Annual EBITDA of $1.7B from 7 trains generated by contracted volumes
– Stock is trading at 16x 2020 EV/EBITDA generated from contracted volumes
– Does not factor in possible delays to LNG train buildout, which is common across the industry
– Difficulty finding buyers willing to commit to long-term contracts 


• 87% of commissioned capacity is on “take or pay” contracts which represent less than 
half of Cheniere’s dream EBITDA


• 13% of capacity is uncontracted and will struggle to breakeven regardless of destination
– Filings do not show sensitivities to Asian LNG prices below $8/mmBtu
– Management assumes gross margins of $4-7/mmBtu on uncontracted volumes, which implies a 


premium to spot prices
– Global LNG markets will remain oversupplied when spare capacity is available for marketing


• Liquefaction terminals have an average utilization rate of 88%
• Cheniere is a complex holding company structure with multiple operating joint ventures
• Most of the LNG trains have not been completed and still need funding


– All 7 trains will cost $29B, but less than half of all construction is complete
– Construction of Corpus Christi trains 1 and 2 will cost $12B


• Operating level financing has caveats
– Class B shares of Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP) increase by 3.5% compounded each quarter


• Management unsure if first LNG cargo will meet 4Q15 target

Residential Solar Market Is Uneconomical


• Government largess, not economics, 
drive residential rooftop systems
– Net metering allows residential 


systems to sell electricity to utilities at 
retail rates


– IRS rules encourage rooftop solar via 
30% investment tax credit (ITC) and 
accelerated depreciation


– Residential rooftop systems are more 
than twice as expensive per watt as 
utility scale solar projects


• Of 6GWs total US solar photovoltaic 
installations in 2014, 1.2GWs were 
residential rooftop systems, most of 
them in California 


• SolarCity and others finance systems 
to households lacking sufficient 
income and upfront capital to take 
advantage of the arbitrage

SolarCity
24


SolarCity Is Really A Financing Scheme


• SolarCity perceived as a solar company with the Elon Musk Effect
• SolarCity does not scale as smaller competitors claim similar 


installation costs
• Competition is increasing and lease rates are declining faster than 


costs
• Solar leases becomes a liability when selling a home 


– New homeowner must take over the lease, otherwise the seller must 
prepay the remaining payments


• Recent changes undermine the business model
– Net metering under pressure in many states, with Hawaii as the first to 


eliminate the program
– 30% ITC expires in 2016
– California electricity rate reform lowers savings for homeowners, as 


existing leases could be underwater, undermining securitizations
25


SolarCity Math


• Returns on invested capital 
based on lease revenues are 
below 8%


• Claims >30% margins on its 
leasing business, but requires 
outside capital to build new 
systems


• 2Q15 LTM FCF of $(1.9B) 
including new systems


• Uses 6% discount rate to 
calculate the net present value of 
20-year residential leases
– Assumes that 90% of customers 


will renew the contract for 
another 10 years
