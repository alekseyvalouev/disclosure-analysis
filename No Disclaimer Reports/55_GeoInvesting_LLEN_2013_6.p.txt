L&L Energy: Huge Undisclosed Dilution And More Negative Chinese

Dickson Lee Hired A Collections Company to Sue LLEN


It's been 13 days since we published our "Whistle Blower" report on L&L Energy
(NASDAQ:LLEN) when we presented several pieces of evidence to support our opinion
that LLEN has been misrepresenting its operations to investors. On September 25, 2013,
The National Business Daily ("NBD"), a national financial newspaper in China, published
an article that confirmed some of our findings. This article will continue to address details
surrounding LLEN issues and summarize a followup article published on September 28,
2013 by NBD that continues to confirm our evidence. But first we think it is imperative to
expand on a topic we touched upon in our initial article regarding a highly dilutive debt for
equity exchange transaction.


On July 2, 2013, Ironridge Global IV, Ltd filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles Superior Court
against LLEN seeking to collect debts Ironridge purchased from LLEN's creditors.


On August 4, 2013, Dickson Lee sold $800,000 of debt LLEN owed him to Ironridge.
Dickson joined two other creditors who had assigned their debts to Ironridge to collect in
Court.


On August 12, 2013, Dickson signed a declaration to the Court acknowledging that LLEN
currently owed $4,983,075 plus attorney and agent fees, costs and expenses to Ironridge.
Dickson declared that LLEN had agreed to issue to Ironridge 2,588,888 shares of LLEN
common stock and promised to issue more shares for each 10-cent drop in LLEN's stock.


LLEN did not disclose the debt for equity deal to investors until an August 16, 2013 8-K
filing. Furthermore, Dickson Lee's involvement in the deal was only reported in the annual
proxy statement filed the same date, rather than included in the 8-K.


LLEN represented in the stipulation for settlement of claims that prior to the issuance to
Ironridge, the Company had 38,149,277 issued and outstanding common shares. Adding
the 2,588,888 shares initially issued to Ironridge, LLEN should have 40,738,165 shares
outstanding following the deal, subject to further issuance for every 10 cent decline in
LLEN's share price.

In an email from LLEN's transfer agent, as of September 30, 2013, there are now
45,084,191 shares outstanding. Thus LLEN's share count has increased by
6,934,914 shares since the debt for equity exchange with Ironridge. Presumably,
most of that huge dilutive issuance has been to Ironridge.


LLEN shareholders can contact the transfer agent to confirm this amount:

If LLEN was as profitable and generating the operating cash flow the company claimed,
why would Dickson Lee and other creditors engage a debt collector? Why would LLEN
then immediately agree to exchange $5 million in debt for a highly dilutive toxic equity
deal?


The National Business Daily Continues its Diligence


On September 28, 2013, The National Business Daily ("NBD"), a national financial
newspaper in China, issued a follow-up report to its September 25, 2013 article discussing
certain facets of the LLEN story and confirming some of our claims of misrepresentation
by LLEN. It also offers some new information that we are sure investors will find intriguing.


We find it incredible that LLEN has not even attempted to address our finding regarding
the Hong Xing coal washing factory. In our first report, we stated:


"Most notably, we will show that revenue of $77.6 million disclosed in LLEN's 2013 10K,
generated from its Hong Xing coal washing factory, was actually close to zero, if it is not
actually zero."


Before we get into NBD's follow-up article, it's important to bring investors up to speed on
the LLEN saga.

Refresher


On September 24, 2013, five days after GeoInvesting published its negative research
report, "Blowing the Whistle on LLEN," LLEN issued a press release, "L&L Energy
Produces Documentation to Repudiate Short-Seller Allegations," to counter our claim that
LLEN does not own two mines it claims to have bought from a PRC based mining
company, Union Energy. Through multiple data sets, specifically including the SAIC filings
of Union Energy, we showed that LLEN never purchased the LaShu and LuoZhou coal
mines from Union energy and that Union Energy still owns these mines, contrary to
LLEN's claims. To argue its case, in its release, LLEN provided statements that it claimed
it made in its 2013 10-K to describe its alleged acquisition of the LaShu and LuoZhou coal
mines:


"In the company's SEC Form 10-K report for the year ended July 31, 2013, the
company clearly states that it acquired the mines by purchasing equity
interests in Union Energy subsidiaries. The Company completed the acquisition
by obtaining a 95% equity interest in two entities, "Guizhou Union Energy Shun Da
Inventory and Transport Corporation" ("Union Shunda"), the owner of LuoZhou
Coal Mine and "Guizhou Union Energy WuZhou Energy Development
Corporation" ("Union WuZhou"), the owner of LaShu Coal mine."


As we will discuss later, our team was quick to publicly point out that the above-referenced
statements were in fact not made anywhere in LLEN's SEC filings.


Also on September 24, 2013, we published and summarized the translated content of an
article written in the NBD which supported many of our findings, including the fact that
LLEN does not own and never did own the LaShu and LuoZhou coal mines and that
Union Energy actually owns these two mines. On September 25, 2013, LLEN issued a
"clarification" of some of the statements made in its September 24th 2013 press release
and reaffirmed its ownership interest in the LaShu and LuoZhou coal mines.


NBD Part Deux


In the most recent development, on September 27th 2013, NBD published a follow-up
article that continued to address LLEN's ownership claims in the LaShu and LuoZhou coal
mines. Here are some of the major points from the article:


Based on NBD's analysis of SAIC files, LLEN does not have any ownership interest in
Union Shunda or Union Wuzhou. In fact, Union Energy owns 100% of both Union

Shunda and Union Wuzhou. Furthermore, Union Shunda owns 100% of the LuoZhou
mine, while the LaShu Mine is 90% owned directly by Union energy and 10% owned
by an individual named Yingquan Guo. Union WuZhou does not have any ownership
interest in either mine.
Through an interview with a Taiwanese investor who has had contact with Dickson
Lee, LLEN has been attempting to raise money in Taiwan and encountered some
obstacles when trying to draw in investment from Taiwanese institutions.
Yunnan Liwei Taifeng Mining Co., Ltd., LLEN's wholesale subsidiary, was cited for
failure to declare and file tax payable on time by the Shizong County Local Tax
Bureau, and was publicly criticized during Qujing City's 2012 joint annual inspection of
foreign-invested enterprises.


GeoInvesting has obtained the SAIC filings of Union Shunda and Union WuZhou and has
verified NBD's findings. We also have video of a lengthy interview of a Union Energy
manager who states that LaShu Mine is 90% owned by Union Energy and 10% owned by
an individual. We provided all of our video evidence to NASDAQ and SEC.


Investors can view the entire transcribed second NBD article here.


We will now go into more detail of the new elements of the LLEN story.


Press Release Carousel


On September 24, 2013, LLEN issued a press release, "L&L Energy Produces
Documentation to Repudiate Short-Seller Allegations."


However, LLEN has yet to produce any such documents to the public, only claiming that it
supplied the following material to its "independent" special committee:


1. The LuoZhou and LaShu equity acquisition agreement;
2. A supplement that explains the deal structure;
3. A Proof of Purchase Status document stating that L&L fulfilled its payment obligations


under the agreement;
4. A legal opinion from DaCheng Law Offices that confirms L&L's controlling interest in


the LuoZhou and LaShu mines.


Interestingly, in the press release, LLEN also stated:

5/23/2018 L&L Energy: Huge Undisclosed Dilution And More Negative Chinese Media - L&L Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:LLEN) | Seeking Alpha


https://seekingalpha.com/article/1723842-l-and-l-energy-huge-undisclosed-dilution-and-more-negative-chinese-media 5/14


"In the company's SEC Form 10-K report for the year ended July 31, 2013, the
company clearly states that it acquired the mines by purchasing equity
interests in Union Energy subsidiaries. The Company completed the acquisition
by obtaining a 95% equity interest in two entities, "Guizhou Union Energy Shun Da
Inventory and Transport Corporation" ("Union Shunda"), the owner of LuoZhou
Coal Mine and "Guizhou Union Energy WuZhou Energy Development
Corporation" ("Union WuZhou"), the owner of LaShu Coal mine."


As required, we would have expected that LLEN would have disclosed the alleged "equity
acquisition agreement" regarding LuoZhou Mine and LaShu Mine in its SEC filings, shortly
after the claimed transaction. However, 10 months after the consummation of this "deal,"
LLEN has yet to file such an agreement to the SEC, that we have seen.


We could not find the verbiage in the press release quote in any of LLEN's SEC filings
explaining that the LuoZhou and LaShu mines were acquired from Union Energy
subsidiaries. In fact, in LLEN's 2013 10K, LLEN only disclosed the following statement
regarding the acquisition of the LuoZhou and LaShu mines:


"On November 18, 2012, we acquired 95% equity interest in both LuoZhou and
LaShu Coal Mine from Union Energy, Inc., and Guizhou Union Capital
Investment Holding Co., Ltd., a Chinese corporation ("Union Capital") with a
cash outlay of approximately $1.7 million and the transfer of the Company's interests
in ZoneLin Coking Plant (98%) and the DaPing Coal Mine (60%)." (Source: LLEN
2013 10K)


In the relevant 8K on Nov. 21, 2012, LLEN further stated:


"On November 18, L & L Energy, Inc., a Nevada corporation ("L&L"), entered into
the LaShu and LuoZhou Mines Sales and Purchase Agreement (the
"Agreement") acquiring the LuoZhou and LaShu mines in the Guizhou Province,
China.


Under the Agreement, L&L acquired 95% of both LuoZhou and LaShu mines from
Union Energy for $37.1 million. This payment was satisfied by a cash outlay of
approximate $1.7 million and transfers of the Company's interests in ZoneLin Coking
Plant (98%) and the DaPing Mine (60%)." (Source: LLEN Nov. 21, 2012 8K)

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1723842-l-and-l-energy-huge-undisclosed-dilution-and-more-negative-chinese-media 6/14


LLEN's stock price reacted positively to its false and misleading September 24, 2013
release, pumping more than 40% within three trading hours after the release, reaching a
high of 1.70. However, investors likely realized that LLEN's release did not match its
statements in its 10K 2013, causing its share price to retreat. LLEN's price has since
pulled back to around $1.30.


It appears that LLEN also realized its press release folly and accordingly, at 9:22 at night
on September 25, 2013, issued another press release:


"To clarify the statement quoted above the 10-K only discloses that the Company did
complete the acquisition by purchasing 95% interest in both the LuoZhou and LaShu
mines from Union Energy through an equity ownership transfer agreement. The
additional disclosure of the names of the two Union Energy subsidiaries were
made to respond to short sellers questioning of L&L's ownership of mines that
do not bear L&L's name. Retaining the name of Union Energy, our joint venture
partner and a reputable and well-connected mining group in the region, on our
operating businesses in no way influences L&L's ownership rights." (Source: Sept.
25, 2013 Press Release)


Running Around in Circles


We believe that the "additional disclosure of the names of two Union Energy subsidiaries"
appears only to be another misrepresentation made by LLEN to cover up its claimed
ownership of the LuoZhou and LaShu mines.


Based on LLEN's claim in its September 24 and 25, 2013 press releases, the LuoZhou
and LaShu mines' ownership structure would be as follows:


In our original report, based on the SAIC files of Union Energy, LuoZhou Mine, and LaShu
mine, we already presented a corporate structure diagram (see below).



http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ll-energy-clarifies-and-reaffirms-ownership-of-mines-225278481.html

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1723842-l-and-l-energy-huge-undisclosed-dilution-and-more-negative-chinese-media 7/14


In our original corporate chart, we already displayed Union Shunda's role in Union
Energy's corporate structure. Union Shunda owns 100% of the LuoZhou Mine (officially
Guizhou Hezhang County LuoZhou Union Energy Co., Ltd. ("LuoZhou Union Energy").
However, based upon the SAIC file we pulled in September 2013, Union Shunda is 100%
owned by Union Energy, rather than 95% owned by LLEN and/or its subsidiaries, as
claimed by LLEN.


Union Wuzhou was not included in our original corporate chart. At the time of our
publication, there was no reason to discuss Union Wuzhou, since it simply does not have
any ownership interest in the LaShu Mine. Based on the SAIC file we pulled in September
2013, Guizhou Hezhang County Liuquhe Town LaShu Union Energy Co., Ltd. ("LaShu
Union Energy"), the legal entity operating the LaShu mine, is in fact 90% owned by Union
Energy and 10% owned by an individual, Guo Yingquan, just as NBD affirmed.


We also have a lengthy video interview of a Union Energy manager who stated that
LaShu Mine is 90% owned by Union Energy and 10% owned by an individual. We already
provided all of our video evidence to the NASDAQ and SEC.


Union WuZhou does not own the LaShu Mine at all, period. We are utterly baffled as to
LLEN's motivation to defend itself by claiming:


1. It acquired Union WuZhou, and
2. That Union WuZhou directly owns the LaShu Mine.


The facts to prove that these claims are false are so easy to prove!


After LLEN's press release, we pulled Union WuZhou's SAIC file. Based on the SAIC file,
Union Energy currently still owns 100% of Union WuZhou. We updated the corporate chart
of Union Energy to include the addition of Union WuZhou as follows:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1723842-l-and-l-energy-huge-undisclosed-dilution-and-more-negative-chinese-media 8/14


As you can see Union Energy owns Union WuZhou, but Union WuZhou does not have
any ownership interest in the LaShu Mine. LLEN doubly misrepresented the true
ownership.


Nation Business Daily's reporter confirmed GeoInvesting's finding regarding
LLEN's ownership issues of the LaShu and LuoZhou mines


On September 28, 2013, NBD published a follow up article regarding LLEN. The article
clearly states:


"Based on the SAIC information of Union Energy and other related companies, the
National Business Daily reporters discovered that, as of September 2013, Union
ShunDa controls 100% of the LuoZhou Mine. Neither LLEN nor its subsidiaries are
among the shareholders of Union ShunDa. Union Energy owns 100% equity interest
in Union ShunDa. Union Energy owns 90% of the equity interest of the Lashu Mine,
while an individual named Yingquan Guo owns the other 10%. The 100% sole
controlling shareholder of Union WuZhou is Union Energy itself and Union Wuzhou
does not own any equity interest in the Lashu Mine."


Simply put, the NBD reporters independently came to our same conclusion regarding the
ownership issues of the LaShu and LuoZhou mines.
