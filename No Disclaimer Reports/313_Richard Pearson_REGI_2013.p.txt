TAL Education: A Real Business With Fake Financials 
Part I 


 
 
Report Date: June 13, 2018 
 
Company:  
TAL Education Group  
 
Ticker:  
(NYSE: TAL US) 
 
Industry:  
China For Profit Education 
 
Stock Price:  
$45.65 
 
Market Cap:  
$26.0 billion 
 
Average Daily Volume (90-day): 
$171.6 million 
 


 
• Although TAL is a “real business”, it has 


been fraudulently overstating its profits since 
at least FY2016. 


• We estimate that during FY2016 through 
FY2018, TAL has overstated net income by 
at least 43.6%.  Our estimates of profit 
inflation are based only on what we are able 
to quantify – fraudulent profit inflation likely 
exceeds this estimate. 


• We estimate that TAL’s cumulative net 
income margin during this period was only 
8.8% (versus 12.4% reported); we estimate its 
FY2018 net income margin was only 10.4% 
(versus 11.6% reported). 


• We believe the fraud pervades the core 
Peiyou business and is migrating into TAL’s 
online businesses. 


• This is Part I in a series of reports.  In this 
report, we cover two sets of fraudulent 
transactions that we estimate inflated TAL’s 
FY2016-FY2018 pre-tax profits by pre-tax 
profits by up to $153.2 million, or 28.4%. 


 
 
Muddy Waters is short TAL Education.   
 
Investors might recall the dark days of 2010 and 2011, during which numerous U.S.-listed China 
companies went down as frauds.  It seemed like every new trading day brought revelations, 
resignations, or re-ratings.  Companies were revealed to be frauds, regardless of their lead 
bankers, auditors, or top shareholders.  According to the recent documentary, the China Hustle, 
there were approximately 400 frauds from China listed on U.S. exchanges.   
 
When the dust settled, there were in hindsight certain indicia that were often present in the most 
troublesome companies: 
 


• Too good to be true – often growing revenues and profits at breakneck paces in highly 
competitive industries, 
 


• Balance sheets blowing out – significant CapEx, acquisitions, or investments, which 
often turned out to be fake uses of non-existent cash to get through audits,
Page 2 of 70	


• Significant non-cash transactions – this was one of the major flags of the granddaddy of 
all China frauds – Sino-Forest.  Non-cash transactions are far too easily manufactured in 
China to be trustworthy. 
 


There followed a retrenching period where many of the problematic companies were de-listed or 
became penny stocks.  The perception was that the companies left standing were the “real” 
companies.  However, what did not happen is as important as what did happen. 
 
Out of literally hundreds of blatant frauds, almost no company chairman did any prison time.  A 
Securities and Exchange Commission judge ordered that the practice licenses of the China 
affiliates of the Big Four, who had issued unqualified audit opinions to blowup after blowup, be 
suspended for six months.  However, the suspensions never came into effect.  Instead, the U.S. 
government settled with the affiliates for $500,000 each, which is roughly equivalent to a yearly 
audit fee for one small client.  In fact, it became difficult for the SEC to act against auditors 
because auditor working papers supposedly became “state secrets” that would subject an 
individual to prison time for providing them to a U.S. regulator.  In other words, after about 400 
frauds, virtually nobody has been meaningfully punished. 
 
Charlie Munger is fond of saying “Show me the incentive, and I’ll show you the outcome”.  
Defrauding U.S. investors from China has proven to be a “heads I win, tails you lose” 
proposition.  So, it does not shock us when we see that TAL began fraudulently creating profits 
as early as FY2016.  Since the beginning of FY2016, the value of Chairman Zhang’s shares have 
skyrocketed from $900 million to close to $7.5 billion.  The prospect of becoming Bobby 
Axelrod rich is a powerful incentive, especially when you have no downside if caught.

Summary 
 
We estimate that TAL has fraudulently overstated its FY2016 – FY2018 results: 
 


• Operating Profit, overstated by at least 21.6% 
• Pre-tax Profit, overstated by at least 39.8% 
• Net Income, overstated by at least 43.6% 


 
The foregoing is only what we can quantify enough to estimate.  We believe the fraud is more 
pervasive, and includes the core Peiyou business and is migrating into its online businesses.  
What we can quantify results from various fraudulent M&A transactions and investments.  The 
below shows our estimates to historical numbers based only on what we can quantify: 
 


 
 
 
We estimate that TAL’s profit margins have been significantly overstated for the past three fiscal 
years: 
 


 
 
 
The reality is that TAL’s margins have deteriorated more than have been reported.  To cover this 
up, the company has resorted to fraud.  TAL combines the old school China fraud playbook of 
simply penciling in more favorable numbers with the more sophisticated asset parking fraud of 
Enron.  (The well-known instance of Enron’s asset parking is when it entered into sales of two 
electricity generating barges in Nigeria with secret agreements to repurchase them.)  In this Part 
I, we detail two asset parking transactions that we estimate from FY2016 through FY2018 
inflated TAL’s pre-tax profits by up to $153.2 million, or 28.4%.    
 
Nobody has performed the highly detailed research on TAL that we have.  Over several months, 
we retrieved over one thousand of pages of PRC government files on various entities belonging 
to, or associated with, TAL.  We obtained and validated third-party credit reports on many of 
these entities.  Our investigators made numerous site visits, and interviewed scores of people 
who worked in TAL, its partners, or had knowledge of its operations.  In this report, we provide 
a detailed roadmap so that investors can recreate significant portions of our work.
Page 4 of 70	


 
TAL will almost certainly deny our conclusions.  As we go back and forth with TAL, we ask 
investors to keep in mind Occam’s Razor.  Occam’s Razor holds that when faced with competing 
explanations, one should select the one that requires the fewest assumptions.  This report 
evidences numerous lies, obfuscations, and inconsistencies by TAL.  As TAL selectively tries to 
explain them away, investors applying Occam’s Razor will be faced with these numerous 
improbable explanations that collectively should be almost impossible, versus a simple 
explanation from us: TAL is committing fraud. 
 





How to Set Your Auditor Up for Failure 
 
It is evident that TAL is starving its auditor, Deloitte China, of resources for the audit.  
Despite TAL’s massively increased complexity since its IPO, its audit fee has only 
grown at a CAGR of 2.8% since FY2011.  During this time, its revenues and assets 
have grown at respective CAGRs of 45.4% and 42.6%.  Audit fees, and therefore man-
hours, have not kept pace with the expansion of the business.  The graph below shows 
the fee versus complexity – in the forms of revenue and assets.   
 
Former Crazy Eddie CFO Sam Antar discusses the importance of starving auditors of 
time when committing fraud (Crazy Eddie was a high-profile 1980s stock fraud).  “The 
less time that [the auditor] had available to audit our books and records, the easier it was 
for us to dupe them into issuing clean audit opinions on our falsified reports.”  (See 
https://whitecollarfraud.com/crazy-eddie/crazy-eddie-fraud/)  
 
We note also that Deloitte China apparently had more China audit failures than any 
other audit firm –by one point in 2012, it had apparently accounted for 43% of the Big 
Four audit failures in China.  (See https://www.tradingfloor.com/posts/china-finance-

Transaction 1 – Shunshun – Asset Parking Leading to Improper Profit Inflation of 
Approximately $66.5 Million 


 
 
The highlighted text above is an important lie.1 
 
Through a series of transactions involving the disposal of a business to an investee, and then 
acquisition of the same investee, TAL booked approximately $50 million of pre-tax profits 
through FY2018.  We believe the disposal was a fraudulent asset parking transaction, and 
therefore substantially all of the reported profits are fraudulent.  We estimate that these 
transactions additionally allowed TAL to improperly capitalize another $16.5 million in losses.  
These transactions also involved the use of an obvious straw party, which raises the likelihood 
that transaction funds were diverted for personal benefit and/or roundtripped as revenue.  TAL 
appears to have compounded the improprieties by penciling in fraudulent revenue numbers for 
the parked business. 
 
The foundation of these transactions is a lie – a lie about the timing of TAL’s initial investment 
into a company called Beijing Shunshun Bida Information Consulting Co. Ltd. (“Shunshun”).  
We believe the fictitious investment date enabled these transactions to escape auditor and 
investor scrutiny, and hid the likely fact that TAL controlled the investee prior to transferring the 
business, Beijing Dongfangrenli Science & Commerce Co., Ltd. (“DFRL”).  Regardless, it 
should be indisputable that TAL lied about timing, roundtripped a business in a way that 
generated substantial non-cash profits, and transacted with a straw counterparty.  Fraudulent 
intent and actions are, in our view, the most logical conclusions to be drawn from these facts. 
 
Background  
 
TAL owned an overseas education intermediary consulting subsidiary called Dongfangrenli 
(“DFRL”).  An overseas education intermediary is essentially a licensed broker for handling 
overseas school recruiting, applications, and placements.  TAL bought this business in 2011.2   
 
In FY 2016, TAL sold DFRL to a company for close to zero consideration.  The buyer was a 
company called Beijing Shunshun Bida Information Consulting Co. Ltd (“Shunshun”).  
Unbeknownst apparently to TAL’s auditor and investors, TAL was already a significant investor 
in Shunshun when it acquired DFRL from TAL.  Shunshun’s core business seems to have 
immediately pivoted to become DFRL.   
 


																																																								
1 TAL FY2016 20-F, p. F-63 
2 TAL FY2012 20-F, p. 53, F-32
Page 8 of 70	


TAL then incrementally increased its investment in Shunshun, ultimately valuing the company at 
$105.9 million (from an initial valuation of $35.1 million in under a year).3  This rocketing 
valuation enabled TAL to book valuation gains of $27.1 million on its earlier investments, and 
consolidate up to an estimated additional $24.8 million of pre-tax profit.4  (We believe that of 
that $24.8 million, approximately $19.7 million is simply made up – i.e., from sales that never 
happened.5)   
 
TAL not only booked fraudulent profits from the Shunshun / DFRL transactions – it improperly 
avoided consolidating $16.5 million of losses Shunshun generated.  This is important because 
following TAL’s initial investment, Shunshun appears to have built its business by selling a 
dollar for 30 cents.6,7   
 
TAL claims its first investment in Shunshun was in December 2015.  This is a lie – and an 
important one.  TAL’s actual first investment in Shunshun was five months earlier, in July 2015.  
TAL transferred DFRL to Shunshun the following month (August 2015).  Therefore, the transfer 
of DFRL was a related party transaction, which ordinarily should receive more scrutiny than an 
arms-length transfer.  We believe the apparent relative lack of scrutiny was foundational to 
improperly inflating profits.  We also see the lie as an attempt to conceal that TAL was likely 
already effectively exerting control over Shunshun, which would have nullified TAL’s ability to 
book valuation gains.   
 
If Deloitte were of the opinion that TAL and Shunshun were already under common control, then 
TAL would not have been able to apply purchase accounting.  Consequently, TAL would not 
have accrued the fair value gains of $27.1 million obtained through its multi-step investment in 
Shunshun.8 
 


																																																								
3 This figure is the fair value for purchase accounting purposes that TAL ascribed.  The implied value of TAL’s 
most recent share purchase is $116.5 million.  See table “Shunshun Implied Fair Value and Investment Value” 
4 TAL FY2016 20-F, pp. 44, F-63. TAL FY17 20-F, F-47. TAL states its first investment in December of 2015 
included the transfer of unspecified nonfinancial assets that provided a fair value gain of $1.9 million in 2015. The 
July 2016 acquisition of the 36% interest also yielded a $25.2 million fair value gain from the re-measurement of its 
original 30% interest. 
5 We believe it is reasonable to assume that the entire $24.8 million of reported deferred revenue was booked 
without matching costs, as part of the goal of the parking seems to have been to de-consolidate losses. 
6 Per SAIC financials, Shunshun’s consolidated CY2016 loss was RMB 101 million on revenue of RMB 43 million. 
7 In making these assessments, we identified the various entities under Shunshun both by checking TAL’s FY2017 
20-F Exhibit 8.1 (subsidiary list) and then checking the China SAIC files to locate additional undisclosed 
subsidiaries.  For example, Beijing Sihai Bida is another Shunshun subsidiary that was established in 2016 and 
engaged in international immigration consulting.  It is not reported in the TAL list of subsidiaries, has little to no 
revenue, and only contributed a small loss of Rmb -3.1 million in 2016.

common-control-transactions-2016.pdf , “If the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (VIE) and the VIE 
are under common control, the primary beneficiary shall initially measure the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling 
interests of the VIE at amounts at which they are carried in the accounts of the reporting entity that controls the VIE 
(or would be carried if the reporting entity issued financial statements prepared in conformity with generally 
accepted accounting principles [GAAP]).”

Shunshun Was a Much Better Choice for Asset Parking than for Business Partnership 
 
If TAL had a good faith desire to invest in DFRL, there seemingly were far better alternatives to 
injecting it into Shunshun.  When TAL acquired Shunshun, it essentially bought back a business 
it had reverse merged into a shell.  Shunshun barely existed before it received TAL’s money and 
DFRL.   
 
TAL apparently received close to zero consideration from Shunshun for DFRL.9  However, TAL 
bought back DFRL (via Shunshun) at a purported implied valuation of up to $116.5 million.10  
The notion that Shunshun could create so much value with DFRL in such a short time fails the 
laugh test. 
 
Shunshun had been formed only six months before TAL’s July 2015 investment.11  At inception, 
it was intended to be an online forum connecting Chinese interested in studying overseas with 
Chinese students who were already abroad.  The purpose was to allow the prospective overseas 
students to ask for advice from the overseas students and overseas school administrators.  To be 
clear, at inception Shunshun was intended to pursue a different business than international study 
intermediation.    


																																																								
9	While DFRL’s shareholders were paid by Shunshun, it does not appear that any funds were returned to TAL, not 
even the security deposit held by China’s Ministry of Education as a kind of licensing bond.  See footnotes 17, 18.

北京蓝橡树信息咨询有限公司 and was founded on January 7, 2015.  Blue Oak changed its name to “Beijing

TAL’s auditor, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, failed in our view to do basic work that 
would have flagged the transfer of DFRL to Shunshun as a related party disclosure.  
SAIC ownership records can be checked online literally in seconds.  We therefore 
assume that an average Deloitte auditor could have done this work within three billable 
hours.  We struggle to understand how Deloitte did not connect the dots of the DFRL 
disposal as “consideration in a purchase agreement for a long-term investment” and 
Shunshun.  Had Deloitte done this basic work, it would have spotted the lie in TAL’s 
disclosure of the Shunshun investment timing.  (It further surprises us that Deloitte 
would not note news reports from June 2015 reporting on TAL’s investment in 
Shunshun.).  Had Deloitte been aware of the relative timing of the investment and 
transfer, TAL’s 20-F would have disclosed the DFRL transfer as a related party 
transaction, which U.S. GAAP mandates (emphasis added): “Transactions between 
related parties are considered to be related party transactions even though they may not 
be given accounting recognition.  For example, an entity may receive services from a 
related party without charge and not record receipt of the service.  While not providing 
accounting or measurement guidance for such transactions, this Topic requires their 
disclosure nonetheless.”  (FASB ASC 850-10-5-5)

Shunshun’s primary founder, Du Zhang, was 19 years old when he left Washington University 
without graduating to become a tech entrepreneur.  Shunshun’s original website appears to have 
launched the next year, in March 2015 – only four months before TAL transferred DFRL to 
Shunshun.12,13  By June 2015, Zhang determined that the clearinghouse business did not work 
because the overseas students were unable to dedicate the time to answering the questions, and 
the advice was perceived as too subjective.14  (In 2014, Zhang had attempted an earlier – also 
venture-funded – version of the online overseas study clearinghouse, called Appliter.  Shunshun 
was his second attempt in a year.15,16)  
 
The below capture from the Waybackmachine.org as of June 21, 2015 (the month before TAL’s 
investment) gives the impression that Shunshun’s site had little traffic, and we would argue, 
highly questionable brand value.  Shunshun seems a poor choice of a vessel in which to expand 
an existing, only tangentially related business.  Regardless, enter TAL and DFRL.

Shunshun got into overseas education consulting by TAL essentially reverse merging that 
business into newly-formed Shunshun:   
 


• Shunshun received DFRL for de minimis consideration.17,18  DFRL had been an overseas 
education intermediary when TAL acquired it in 2011.   


• DFRL had the license that was necessary for Shunshun to operate as an overseas 
intermediary education consultant.  The license was the reason TAL had purchased 
DFRL in the first place.19 


• TAL contributed the overseas education website it had operated since 2011: 
http://liuxue.com (the URL means “study overseas”).  TAL’s overseas study website had 
been generating traffic since 2011.  Through the first six months of 2015, it had been 
generating from 61,900 to 87,800 sessions per month according to rank2traffic.com 
estimates.  In contrast, Shunshun’s site generated an estimated zero sessions per month as 
of March 1st, and according to rank2traffic.com, sessions per month had ramped to 
30,500 as of June 16th.  Liuxue.com was transferred from TAL to Shunshun in December 
2015, and for a period of time both were operating in parallel.  Shunshunliuxue.com now 
redirects traffic to liuxue.com.  


• TAL reportedly granted Shunshun access to its national customer database.20 
 
One might expect that Shunshun had to pay TAL for this new lease on corporate life.  However, 
the opposite is true.  TAL invested cash in Shunshun.  The media reported TAL invested $18 
million, although TAL’s 20-F disclosure (which contains the lie about timing) says $10.5 
million.21,22  We understand TAL’s fair value for DFRL upon disposal was zero.23 
  


																																																								
17 TAL FY2012 20-F, p. F-32, TAL FY2013 20-F, p. F-40, note 10: in FY2012 TAL acquired DFRL for its license 
and specifically ascribed to its license a value of $823,934. The next year, FY13, TAL stated it revised its business 
strategy and decided to not develop the study abroad business. It wrote off $594,162 and the balance of $229,772 
was to remain on deposit with the Education Bureau and recorded on TAL’s books as restricted cash.  
18 TAL FY2016 20-F, p.3: in the year when TAL contributed DFRL to Shunshun, it may have recognized a small 
gain of US$235,797 from disposal of investments as per its SEC 6-K filings for FY2016 Q2 and Q3.  The gain was 
not described in detail and may have come from more than one source.  Since the $235,797 corresponds closely to 
the balance of $229,772 on deposit as “restricted cash” and the rest of the investment in DFRL had been written off, 
we believe that the $235,797 might actually represent a payment for the cash at the Education Bureau. Moreover, 
since TAL itself had just stepped up as the first and only investor to fund Shunshun approximately two weeks 
earlier, to the extent any actual cash changed hands, TAL is also the most likely source for that cash. In other words, 
if there was cash consideration paid, TAL likely just paid itself.

This report details below the egregious accounting misdeeds we believe TAL committed after 
investing in Shunshun, but at this point we ask some fundamental questions: assuming that in 
mid-2015, TAL suddenly got bulled up on overseas education consulting (even though it had 
been in that business since 2011), was Shunshun, which was run by a 19-year-old and appears to 
have essentially failed at its core business within roughly three months, the obvious means for 
TAL to invest in overseas education consulting?26  Why did TAL choose to reverse merge its 
business into Shunshun, rather than committing the resources internally at DFRL?   
 
At the time TAL acquired the majority of Shunshun, it is clear that TAL was basically re-
acquiring DFRL.  Shunshun operated using DFRL’s license.27  DFRL as an entity booked 60% 
of Shunshun’s consolidated revenues, 65% of its operating costs, and 41% of its SG&A.28  As of 


																																																								
24 TAL disclosed part of the consideration paid to acquire Shunshun was a nonfinancial asset. DFRL being a 
company with share equity is a financial asset, not a nonfinancial asset.  The license could be considered a 
nonfinancial asset, but the license was owned by the entity and it was the entire entity which was transferred.

27 Until March of 2018, Shunshun prominently displayed the DFRL license on both its liuxue.com and 
dongfangrenli.cn websites.27,27  The dongfangrenli.cn website has since been taken down while the liuxue.com 
website no longer displays this certificate.  However, these websites can still be seen by accessing certain web 
archives and the waybackmachine.org.

Sloppy Audit Indicator 
 
DFRL was transferred to Shunshun for zero to little consideration.  It is our opinion that 
TAL’s transfer of DFRL as partial consideration in a long-term investment should have been 
recorded among its non-cash investing and financing activities along with other non-cash 
activities, but it was not.  Only payable items under non-cash investing and financing 
activities were shown, and other non-cash financing or investment activities are not reported.  
Because there is a non-cash investing disclosure, there should be a non-cash investment 
amount of at least $1.9 million reported.
Page 13 of 70	


December 31, 2016, DFRL apparently had 277 employees, versus Shunshun’s 49 employees.29  
In CY2016, DFRL also provided 67.5% of Shunshun’s deferred revenues as of December 31, 
2016, which as we explain below, appear to be largely fraudulent.  We conclude that TAL 
involved itself with Shunshun for the primary purpose of inflating earnings through parking 
DFRL.   
 
 
Timeline: Reality vs. TAL’s Fiction 
 
Assuming one did not question the motives of the reverse merger of DFRL into Shunshun, the 
transaction timeline proceeded in a largely logical manner: 
 


• On June 1, 2015, Shunshun brought in a new chairman and CEO, Yang Zhang.30  Yang 
Zhang became the Chairman on June 25th, 2015.31 


• As early as June 11th, Chinese media reported that TAL would be making an $18 million 
investment into Shunshun.32  (Note that TAL disclosed it had only made a $10.5 million 
investment in December of 2015.33)  


• On July 2nd, TAL chairman Zhang and two other TAL executives terminated DFRL’s 
VIE agreement.  DFRL was a “variable interest entity” or “VIE”, which means that TAL 
did not actually own the company; however, it supposedly controlled it and therefore 
consolidated it due to the VIE agreement between TAL and DFRL.  DFRL’s actual 
owners were Chairman Bangxin Zhang, Yachao Liu, and Yunfeng Bai. 


• On July 13th, Chairman Zhang, Liu, and Bai signed the shares transfer agreement 
between themselves, as individual shareholders, and Shunshun.  (See Appendix A for the 
executed signature page.)  Three days later, on July 16, 2015, the three, acting as the 
directors of DFRL, also approved the share transfer.    


• On July 23rd, TAL officially became an equity investor in Shunshun – TAL was likely 
the first Shunshun investor to have actually funded its investment in the company.  (See 
Appendix B.) 


• The SAIC filings reflect that on July 30th, the DFRL transfer to Shunshun was officially 
recorded.34  (See Appendix C.)  Shunshun then appointed its CEO, Yang Zhang, to be 
DFRL’s new Executive Director and Legal Representative on August 1, 2015. 


• The DFRL share pledges were cancelled with the SAIC on August 3rd, 2015.35

31 Shunshun’s SAIC file shows this as the date on which Yang Zhang became its Executive Director which is the 
equivalent to a Chairman of a small company with only one director.  Once more directors were added in November 
2015, his title was changed to Chairman.

If all of this were on the up and up, why would TAL lie about the timeline, and claim it invested 
in Shunshun four months after it reversed merged its overseas education consulting business into 
Shunshun?  Shunshun’s 2015 Annual Report filed with the SAIC shows that TAL invested in 
Shunshun in July of 2015, which is consistent with Chinese media reports.  However, TAL’s 20-
F disclosure is false – it states that it invested in Shunshun in December 2015, which would have 
been five months later than TAL really did invest.   
 
 
 
 
 
 
TAL seems to have deliberately obfuscated DFRL was transferred to Shunshun.  In the same 20-
F in which TAL disclosed it owned 30% of Shunshun, it separately disclosed the disposal of 
DFRL.36  Rather than admitting Shunshun bought DFRL, it obliquely refers to the buyer as a 
“long-term investment”.  In our opinion, this failure to identify DFRL / Shunshun as a related 
party transaction is to avoid scrutiny of the propriety of the transactions and the subsequent 
valuation gains.

DFRL’s Name Change – Was it Sent into TAL’s Witness Protection Program? 
 
In both FY16 and FY17, DFRL was listed among TAL’s disclosed major subsidiaries.  
However, in FY17, TAL changed the English translation slightly in what appears to be an 
attempt to imply it was not the same DFRL transferred out in FY16.   
 


FY2016 Subsidiary list:    Beijing Dongfangrenli Science & Commerce Co., Ltd.    


FY2017 Subsidiary list:    Beijing Dongfangrenli Trade Development Co., Ltd.    
 
DFRL’s Chinese name is the company’s only legal name, and has never changed.  While 
TAL may try to argue the new translations is equally valid, the change is unnecessary and 
seems to serve only one purpose: to create the false impression it is not the same DFRL.  	


Ironic Fact: TAL was likely the first Shunshun investor to actually record a cash 
contribution into the Shunshun entity.

How to Succeed in Investing Without Making Money: Purchase Accounting Games 
 
Accounting rules around investments offer a perverse incentive for bad faith actors.  If a 
company wants to inflate earnings, one option is to make a minority investment in another 
company, and then make subsequent investments at higher valuations.  As the investor buys 
shares at higher prices, it books (non-cash) gains on its earlier purchases.  Shunshun / DFRL was 
perfect for valuation manipulation because its constant thirst for new cash and its shareholders’ 
willingness to exit quickly gave TAL multiple opportunities to manufacture gains.  The most 
brazen part of this scheme was the insertion of a straw counterparty to effect a massive valuation 
bump – causing us to believe TAL’s cash has likely been diverted for personal gain and / or to be 
roundtripped as revenue.   
 
TAL states its first investment was in December of 2015 in the form of cash and certain 
unspecified nonfinancial assets.  (As we showed above, TAL lied about the timing of the 
investment.) The transfer of this nonfinancial asset provided a small fair value gain of $1.9 
million in 2015.37		Upon making this investment, TAL’s reported the fair value for its 30% stake 
in Shunshun / DFRL as $10.5 million.38  This equates to an implied enterprise value of $35.1 
million. 
 
Valuing Shunshun at $35.1 million as of the actual time of TAL’s investment in June/July 2015 
strains credulity.  At the time of the June 2015 announcement, Shunshun was a start-up with a 
small team, a simple website, and a desire to change business models.39  Shunshun had launched 
its site on March 6, 2015, and within three months, had supposedly decided to redirect the 
business into overseas education consulting.  
 
In June 2016, TAL purchased a controlling stake in Shunshun / DFRL from a straw party at an 
implied value of $90.8 million.40  TAL purportedly paid this straw party $32.7 million in cash 
and stock, broken into $19.1 million cash and common shares valued at $13.6 million.41  This 
transaction also yielded a $25.2 million fair value gain on TAL’s initial 30% investment.  It is 
hard to see how Shunshun / DFRL would rationally be valued at anything close to $90 million, 
let alone TAL’s then fair value for accounting purposes of $103.7 million.  In CY2017 Shunshun 
/ DFRL was selling a dollar of a highly labor-intensive consulting service for about 35 cents, 
which, to be fair, was up from about 30 cents the year before.  The $90.8 million valuation fails 
our laugh test...with flying colors.   
 
Shunshun’s CY2015 – CY2017 financials are in Appendix E, showing its sales of a dollar for 
roughly 30 and 35 cents, respectively.42

combined revenue in CY2016.

Stinky Transaction Leading to a Massive Valuation Gain 
 
Shunshun hired a new chairman and CEO just prior to TAL’s investment: Yang Zhang.43  The 
35-year old Mr. Zhang was a well-known figure in education in China, having written a book 
with his wife about his experience studying in the U.S. called “My Harvard Diary”. 44,45  He 
joined Shunshun in June 2015.  His tenure was ultimately short, though, as it appears he left after 
only approximately 12 to 18 months.46   
 
Oddly for such a short tenure, he was granted 50% of the equity in the Shunshun entity.  His 
shares appear to have fully vested, and he got liquidity for most of them after just one year.  
However, it was not TAL to whom he sold his shares.  Surprise!  The “buyer” was a newly-
established Fujian company controlled by wife, Beixi Wang.47      
 
Beixi Wang established Fuzhou Minqing Forest Park Business Center Limited Partnership 
(Minqing) on May 26, 2016.  Only two weeks later, on June 7th, 36% of Shunshun was 
transferred to Minqing.  The transferors were her husband Yang Zhang and co-founders Du 
Zhang and Yuxiao Liu.48  It is unclear what consideration, if any, Minqing paid to the 
transferors.  It was from Minqing that TAL acquired its next stake in Shunshun / DFRL with the 
transfer to TAL being official as of June 23rd.49,50   
 
TAL purports that it purchased this 36% block for a total of $32.7 million, at a fair value of 
$103.7 million, which generated a valuation gain of $25.2 million in FY2017.51   
 
Shockingly, Minqing did not build upon its apparent overnight business success.  It was de-
registered October 10th.  As of early 2017, though, Ms. Wang and her husband appeared to be 
traveling the world.52  On January 2, 2017, Mr. Zhang’s personal blog, which had been dormant

The valuation ascribed to this 36% of shares fails the laugh test, and the transaction structure 
fails the smell test.  We do not know what really happened to the money and shares TAL 
purports to have paid, but we strongly suspect it was diverted for personal gain to TAL 
management and / or to be funneled back into TAL’s business somewhere as revenue.  
Regardless, TAL generated accounting profit that helped to obscure margin deterioration in its 
core business.   
 
The below shows Fuzhou Minqing’s receipt of 36% of Shunshun’s shares from Yang Zhang, Du

Q: What do TAL and Janet Jackson Have in Common? 
A: They’re in Control…And They Love It 
 
Under accounting rules, TAL’s ability to use purchase accounting and book valuation 
gains was predicated on the notion that it was not the controlling shareholder.  It is 
obvious to us that TAL was effectively controlling Shunshun from the moment Shunshun 
agreed to absorb DFRL and build out the overseas intermediary consulting business.  The 
entire chain of transactions screams pre-planned, as evidenced by the lie about timing and 
attempts to obfuscate DFRL’s roundtrip; Shunshun’s apparent lack of suitability for a 
legitimate partnership; the quick flips of equity by short-term shareholders at seemingly 
significant profits; and egregious valuations that fail the laugh test.  The Occam’s razor 
explanation in our view is that all of this was orchestrated by TAL from the beginning.  
The alternative would be to believe a series of individually improbable explanations for 
each of these issues (i.e., a series of coincidences) that we believe, when the probabilities 
are combined, would amount to nearly impossible.

FreeS Fund: The New King of China VC? 
 
TAL chose to downplay the new fund’s massive initial success – it did not mention it by name 
in its disclosure, only referring to FreeS Fund as “a noncontrolling interest holder”.  We think 
FreeS Fund’s stunning success deserves more recognition.   
 
FreeS Fund reportedly has a limited partner-friendly fee structure that incentivizes FreeS to 
earn at least 3x on an investment.  At 5x, FreeS Fund earns a 30% carry.  Below is a slide 
from FreeS Fund’s marketing deck in 2015 explaining the structure. 
 





We note that Mr. Li was at IDG when TAL transferred, and then bought back, Guangzhou 1-
on-1 to / from an IDG portfolio company.  These transactions, which are the focus of the 
second part of this report, generated for TAL approximately $60 million in accounting profits.

DFRL’s Financials Appear to be Falsified, Giving TAL up to $24.8 Million of Fraudulent Profit 
in FY 2018 
 
When TAL acquired enough Shunshun / DFRL to begin consolidating the business, TAL 
reported Shunshun / DFRL purportedly had a deferred revenue balance of $24.8 million.61  The 
timing of TAL’s consolidating investment suggests that maximizing deferred revenue was an 
important goal of the re-acquisition.  We believe that most – to all – of that deferred revenue fell 
to the pretax income line.  We also believe that most – to all of it – is fraudulent.   
 
Deferred revenue is a liability that results when a student prepays a fee, and remains on the 
balance sheet until the service has been delivered, which, in the case of Shunshun / DFRL, is 
placement at an overseas school and receipt of visa.62  When the service is delivered, the deferred 
revenue is recognized as revenue on the income statement.   
 
There are generally costs to deliver the service that are matched to the deferred revenue as it is 
recognized.  By consolidating Shunshun in July, TAL likely maximized the (real) deferred 
revenue and profit because the students admitted to study overseas should have been about to 
receive their visas, allowing TAL to recognize the deferred revenue.  (Also, TAL’s costs were 
largely already incurred). Regardless, we assume that fraudulent deferred revenue would have no 
matching costs – fraudulently creating marginally profitable revenue would not seem to be worth 
the risk of exposure.   
 
At least $19.7 million of Shunshun / DFRL’s $24.5 million deferred revenue balance appears 
purely fraudulent.  PRC law requires that each corporate entity file financial statements with 
SAIC (the State Administration of Industry and Commerce) each year along with copious 
amounts of other data provided as part of the annual inspection.  SAIC financials in our 
experience are often prepared by a relatively low-level accounting or finance department 
functionary who is essentially copying the financials provided to the tax bureau.  Therefore, 
unless there is intervention by someone at the top of a company, we believe SAIC financials are 
usually going to present a pretty clear picture of the company’s financials.        
 
In the early days of exposing China frauds (2010-2011), firms such as MW often caught 
companies with their pants down by finding SAIC financials that completely contradicted their 
SEC filings.  In early 2011, the frauds became attuned to this vulnerability, and almost certainly 
at the behest of top management, began filing fraudulent SAIC financials on a go forward basis 
as well as trying to amend their historical financials.  There is no penalty in China for filing 
fraudulent financials with SAIC.  (Tax fraud on the other hand is a serious crime.)  It is therefore 
now rare to find a China fraud that is too lazy or stupid to file fraudulent financials with SAIC. 
 
As a result, we look for indicia that the SAIC accounts are fraudulent – often these take the form 
of internal inconsistencies (e.g., balance sheet to income statement), inconsistencies with other 
group entities’ financials, or significant amendments.  There are two indicia of fraud in Shunshun

business is based on they need to get an offer and they need to get a visa. So I think in general, most of them will 
come to recognize maybe in Q3 or Q4 next fiscal quarter.”

/ DFRL’s financial statements.  The first is significant post hoc changes to DFRL’s SAIC 
accounts – these changes were executed just before TAL filed its 20-F disclosing the deferred 
revenue.  Among the amendments was an improbable near three times increase in deferred 
revenue.  Further, comparing the CY2016 deferred revenue balance to CY2017 recognized 
revenue makes the changed deferred revenue balance (which matches the 20-F) implausible.63    
 
Fraud Indicator #1: 
 
The changes to DFRL’s CY2016 financials added Rmb 129 million (~US $19.7 million) to its 
assets and Rmb 131 million (~US $19.7 million) to its liabilities.  Its assets were substantially all 
composed of cash, pre-payments to suppliers (compensation to consultants), and other 
receivables from customers.  DFRL’s updated liabilities were almost entirely (97.4%) composed 
of pre-payments or advances from customers, or as listed in TAL’s books, “deferred revenue”. 
 
These changes came on May 31, 2017, five months after calendar year end, over one month after 
its April earnings release for fiscal year 2017, and just under a month before its June submission 
of its audited financials and 20-F to the SEC.64  
 
The documents below will first show where the changes were found, how they match up with the 
detailed financial information in DFRL’s credit report, and then we present a table to compare 
before and after. 
 
  


																																																								
63 We also obtained Shunshun and DFRL’s CY2017 SAIC financials and reviewed them to assess the conversion of 
CY2016 deferred revenue to CY2017 revenue.  CFO Rong Luo explained on multiple occasions that a unique aspect 
of Shunshun’s model is that revenue recognition can take up a full year, or longer.  DFRL’s CY2017 revenue totaled 
only Rmb53.4 million.  This closely ties with the expected conversion of deferred revenue from the pre-amendment 
~Rmb 74 million level as opposed to the post-amendment Rmb 199 million level. 
64 TAL FY2017 and Q4 6-K, dated April 28, 2017.  The totals for current and non-current deferred revenue in the 
earnings release matches that in TAL’s FY2017 20-F.
Page 23 of 70	


The below images are from the DFRL CY2016 SAIC annual report.  At the top of the first page a 
note states that eight items had been changed.
Page 24 of 70	


This annual report only provides the value of the numerical changes, not what line items in the 
financials were amended.65 By comparing these numbers to the SAIC financials and a third-party 
credit report, we could verify with a high degree of confidence that the post-change numbers 
matched the final 2016 figures.66  The eight changes were: 





 
 
The DFRL SAIC financial to credit report reconciliation is in Appendix D. 
 
  


																																																								
65 It is important to note that the SAIC financial are reported in units of ten-thousands or  “万元”.  This is a normal 
practice in China; however, the credit reports often display the data in thousands. 
66 The DFRL credit report was provided by a Chinese credit monitoring service that has access to more detailed 
information on the SAIC financials.  We are able to verify that the credit reports are using current information by 
comparing the numbers presented for the major categories noted above to those shown in the current SAIC 
financials.  When the credit reports’ major categories (e.g. assets, liabilities, etc.) tie to those in SAIC financials, we 
assume that the credit report is current and substantially accurate.
Page 25 of 70	


As can be seen below, the major changes were to the liabilities (substantially all of which are 
deferred revenues) and the assets (cash, pre-paid expenses, and other receivables).  We find it 
difficult to believe that the accounting team could overlook $19.7 million in cash and payments 
collected from customers, and at the same time also forget about an equal amount of assets in the 
form of pre-payments to suppliers/consultants, other receivables, or cash.  The total value of 
contracts signed by customers would have been closely monitored.  Banks would have had 
detailed records of the deposits.  Expenses paid out would likewise have run through the banks, 
and sufficient back-up would have been required for the payments to consultants.
Page 26 of 70	


 
 
Fraud Indicator #2 
 
Shunshun and DFRL’s SAIC financials show a CY2016 deferred revenue to CY2017 recognized 
revenue conversion ratio that makes the changes to deferred revenue seem implausible.67  We 
expected to see a very high percentage of year-end deferred revenues be recognized the 
following year.  CFO Rong Luo explained on multiple occasions that a unique aspect of 
Shunshun’s model is that revenue recognition can take up a full year, or longer.68  Further, our 
interviews with two former Shunshun / DFRL employees indicated that substantially all 
consulting customers earn placements (and therefore Shunshun / DFRL is recognizing revenue).   
 
If we look at DFRL on a standalone basis, we see that DFRL’s CY2017 revenue totaled only 
Rmb 53.4 million.  That is only 26.8% of the post-change deferred revenue of the Rmb 199.6 
million as at the year-end of CY2016, which is an implausibly low conversion percentage.  The 
pre-change conversion rate would have been 72.2% of the Rmb 68.9 million as at the year-end of 
CY2016, which is only a little lower than we would have expected.  This comparison solidifies 
our opinion that the bulk of the reported deferred revenue TAL acquired is fraudulent.   
 
The most reasonable explanation is a simple top-down manipulation that required corresponding 
changes at a lower-level subsidiary.   
 





																																																								
67 The CY2015-CY2017 SAIC financials for Shunshun and DFRL are presented in the section below. 
68 TAL FY17 Q1 earnings call.  As described by CFO Rong Luo, the process to complete the application, obtain an 
acceptance into the overseas school, and obtain the visa is long and therefore the revenue recognition is often 
delayed 10 to 12 months.   


Audit Question 
   
Was Deloitte aware of the May 30, 2016 changes to DFRL’s SAIC financials that added 
$19.7 million in deferred revenue? 
	


Book Cooking 101: Count Your Cash 
	
The SAIC financial changes show a sloppy book cooking mistake – messing up the 
purported amount of cash in the bank.  As shown below, the cash balance after the 
changes exceeds the pre-change total assets!  Cash balances require little skill to check, 
therefore the odds that someone made such a mistake in preparing year-end financials are 
low. 
 


Total Assets – Before Changes:  Rmb 15.1 million 
Cash Balance – After Changes: Rmb 15.3 million
Page 27 of 70	


Shunshun is a Dog 
Shunshun / DFRL lost even more money in 2017 than in 2016 and shows numerous indicia of 
being a troubled business.  At the end of the day, we do not believe that matters to TAL’s 
management because it served its purpose, and TAL can engage in more fraud in the future to 
offset any losses it consolidates from Shunshun / DFRL.  
 
Just prior to the release of this report, Shunshun and DFRL’s 2017 SAIC financials became 
available.  They are in Appendix E.  The CY2016 and CY2017 performance of the two entities 
together displays two significant trends: 
 
First, from 2016 to 2017, losses in the combined business have expanded, increasing 44% from 
Rmb (98.5) million to (141.5) million.  Second, the conversion rate of combined deferred 
revenues as at the end of CY2016 to CY2017 recognized revenue has decreased significantly.  If 
using the original (i.e., pre-change) CY2016 deferred revenue of Rmb 112.5 million, the 
covnersion rate is only 68%, which is far short of its 84% rate the year before.  (The rate would 
be 31% if using the post-change deferred revenues.)  Based on interviews with Shunshun’s 
consultants who state that virtually all students ultimately are placed in a school to attend, a 68% 
rate is much lower than we expected.69   
 
The table below shows the combined Shunshun and DFRL financials and compares the CY2015 
and CY2016 deferred revenue to the following years’ recognized revenues.  Note, this differs 
from the calculation above, which examined this same ratio for DFRL as an individual entity. 
 


 
  
We therefore conclude that either the Shunshun consultants are doing a terrbile job placing 
students oveerseas, or Shunshun’s CY2016 deferred revenue numbers contain more fraud than 
we have been able to detect to date.  We suspect it’s both. 


																																																								
69 After deducting the inflated deferred revenue suspected as fraud, the CY16 liabilities are Rmb 172.81 million 
(303.58-130.77) and CY17’s recognized revenue of Rmb 76.47 million equates to a conversation rate of just 44.2%.

The Impact of Restating TAL’s Financials to Consolidate Shunshun from July 2015 
 
Our analysis of the Shunshun transaction being in substance an investment TAL made into itself 
is based upon on the glaring evidence of deception regarding TAL’s initial investnent date into 
Shunshun and injection of the critical asset of DFRL into Shunshun, which served to build out 
this overseas intermediary consulting business outside of TAL’s own P&L and classify such 
expenses as investment capital. 
 


																																																								
70 This conclusion is based on several of Rong Luo’s statements about Shunshun in the Q2 and Q3 2018 earnings 
calls.  Q2: a.) the combined First Leap, Shunshun, and another small acquired company would account for around 7-
10% of the total revenue mix for Q2. We calculate that to be ~US$31.9~45.6m. b.) Shunshun is now reported in the 
One-on-one category.  In FY2018, the revenue contribution of one-on-one was 12.1% of total revenue, which works 
out to US$55.2m. If you take out Shunshun, the Zhikang one-on-one business growth was “very well” and 
especially if compared to one or two years ago they “recovery so much.” FY17Q2 was 10.5% of total rev, or 
US$28.5m, up 26.1% from FY16Q2. FY16Q2 was 13% of total rev, or US$22.6m. If in Q2 one-on-one’s growth 
was 40-60% then its revenue would be $40m to $46m and Shunshun’s could be $10m to $16m.  In Q3, Rong Luo 
reminds that Q2 is the “big season” for Shunshun. 


Sneak Preview of More Fraud? 
	
From our analysis of the FY2018 earnings calls, we think that CFO Rong Luo’s guidance 
for Shunshun’s revenue predicts that they may once again amend results and/or simply 
claim greatly inflated revenues.  In the Q2 earnings call, Rong Luo guided for Q3 2018 
deferred revenues, stating:  


“…we have acquired Shunshun from last year Q3. So when we consider a Q1 and 
Q2 top line growth, actually they can give us something, additional numbers over 
there which is around 5% growth rate perspective.”  


- 2018 Q2 earning’s call, CFO Rong Luo 


In these comments, Rong Luo projects Shunshun’s revenues in the first half to be based on 
a 5% growth rate year-on-year.  However, just looking at FY2017 Q2 revenue alone we 
can see that this is an exaggeration.  Five percent growth onto just FY2017 Q2’s revenue 
of $271.1 million is $13.56 million (Rmb 90.3 million), which is already 27% higher than 
Shunshun’s full year revenue reported to SAIC of Rmb 76.47 million.  Morevoer, in the 
Q3 2018 earnings call CFO Rong Luo adds that Q3 and Q4 “will be much better than that 
[in the first half]” causing us to suspect the company may again seek to inflate its revenues 
by an even greater degree.  Because TAL’s FY2018 20-F has not yet been released, and 
major amendments were made to the deferred revenues this time last year, we intend to 
continue to monitor the reporting on Shunshun’s revenues and performance, as well as 
changes to the SAIC financials.
Page 29 of 70	


 
 
We believe that TAL should restate its financials to include the costs to develop Shunshun 
consolidated as of the date of initial investment in July 2015 or the transfer of DFRL in August 
2015.  We estimate such a restatement would result in an additional decrease to operating and net 
profit of $10.17 million in FY2015, and $6.28 million in FY2016. 
 
In addition to restating to consolidate Shunshun’s combined FY2016 and FY2017 operational 
losses of ($16.5) million, we also believe that the fair value gains accrued in FY2016 of $1.9 
million and FY2017 of $25.2 million, as well as at least $19.7 million in likely fraudulent 
FY2017 deferred revenue (that would enter TAL’s books as revenue in FY2018) should be 
adjusted out of earnings.71  As of the end of FY2017, the revenue had not been recognized; 
however, based on company disclosures, we expect it to have been recognized over the course of 
FY2018.72 Moreover, we strongly suggest that investors and analysts consider the negative 
impact of the ongoing losses and low deferred revenue to revenue conversation rate at Shunshun 
and to make adjustments to FY2018 after the audited financials are released.   
 
 
																																																								
71 As TAL appears to have fraudulently inflated deferred revenue acquired from Shunshun via its subsidiary DFRL, 
we believe it was unlikely that the proper discounting of deferred revenue obtained through an acquisition per ASC 
805 was applied – had it, the revenue would have been immediately reduced, and not dramatically increased almost 
a year later as seen through the SAIC amendments.  Therefore, we believe it would be reasonable to apply a 
discount to the remaining balance of the deferred revenue based on the cost of delivering the deferred revenue - the 
remaining liability. We feel this discount would likely be substantial since the acquisition occurred in mid-summer, 
at which time applications should have been in and all or substantially all of Shunshun’s work on the applications 
for fall 2016 entrance should be complete. However, to provide a conservative estimate; we did not. 
72 TAL FY2017 1Q earnings call, CFO Rong Luo, “In July of 2017, Shunshun’s CFO explained on the 2017 Q1 
earnings call that Shunshun’s revenue recognition is delayed by ten to twelve months.”  Additional discussion and 
references throughout this report. 


Should TAL Impair Any of Shunshun’s $93 Million of Goodwill?  
 
We see justifications for a significant impairment, including:  
 
• Mounting losses: In CY 2017, Shunshun/DFRL’s combined loss increased from $14.8 


million to $21.0 million. 
• Fewer contracts: Our fieldwork indicates that the peak for new client contracts was likely 


in CY2016.  
• Staff reduction: The 2017 Annual Reports for Shunshun / DFRL show declining 


headcount.  DFRL dropped the number of official employees for whom it made social 
welfare tax payments from 277 in CY2016 to 184 in CY2017.  Shunshun slashed its staff 
in half from 49 to 24.  


• Branch closures: Shunshun’s website shows that it has cut its branch network by half, 
from 16 at peak to 8 offices in early CY2018.  A Shunshun employee told our 
investigators two more closings are likely in the offing. 


• Cash crunch: Shunshun’s credit report (not including that of DFRL) shows its year-end 
cash position dropped from $6.6 million (Rmb 42.9 million) in CY2016 to just $36 
thousand (Rmb 0.2 million) in CY2017.

Transaction 2 – Guangzhou One-on-One (GZ 1-1) – Asset Parking Leading to Estimated 
Improper Pre-Tax Profit Inflation of Approximately $60 Million 


TAL’s Guangzhou One-on-One transactions were so egregious that “asset parking” would be a 
kind description.  TAL’s bad faith went much deeper – we believe that the asset transfer, which 
purportedly generated a substantial gain, never even took place.  We conclude that this claimed 
transaction fraudulently inflated pre-tax profits by up to $59.4 million from FY2016 through 
FY2018.  In this case, TAL claimed to have transferred its Guangzhou one-on-one tutoring 
business while recognizing a $50 million pre-tax gain.  This purported gain accounted for 58.8% 
of FY2016 pre-tax income and 36.4% of net income.  The consideration TAL received was 
equity in the recipient.   
 
Only 15 months later, TAL claimed to have allowed “the buyer” to return the business in 
exchange for canceling the $50 million equity TAL received in the first place.  Not only did TAL 
not reverse the $50 million pre-tax gain it had reported, it then consolidated $9.4 million of 
deferred revenue upon reconsolidation.  We suspect substantially all of this deferred revenue fell 
to the pre-tax income line.  Moreover, we believe most – if not all – of this deferred revenue was 
fraudulent. 
 
We see it as obvious that TAL always intended to take the business back, and that this series of 
transactions was executed for the sole reason of improperly generating accounting profits.  The 
use of non-cash consideration (aka “funny money”) on both legs is a screaming red flag.  
Scratching the surface, though, reveals an extraordinary set of facts – facts that cause us to 
believe that each purported transfer of the business was a complete sham.  In other words, we 
believe TAL never transferred the substance of the business.   
 


What’s Mine is Mine, What’s Yours is Mine: DFRL Joins the List of Abusive VIE 
Transactions  
	
We and many others have been warning for years about the risks to U.S. investors of the 
VIE structures common in China companies.  (If you own China stocks and do not know 
the basics of the VIE structure and the related concerns, you have no business investing in 
these stocks.)  By roundtripping DFRL, TAL now joins the ignominious list of VIE 
abusers – the Hall of Fame of which includes Gigamedia, ChinaCast Education, and Puda 
Coal.        
 
After acquiring DFRL in 2011, TAL set the company up as one of its VIEs and began 
consolidating it.  Prior to TAL transferring DFRL to its investee Shunshun, DFRL and 
TAL had to first cancel their VIE agreement.  They completed the VIE termination on 
July 2, 2015 and the DFRL transfer to Shunshun was recorded with the SAIC on July 30, 
2015.  There are legitimate reasons why a company would cancel its VIE agreement, but 
parking the business to generate fraudulent profits is clearly not one of them.

The GZ 1-1 purported sale and buyback were engineered non-cash transactions designed to 
create the $50 million gain. 
 
 
Background 
 
In April 2015, TAL invested $6.3 million into a company called Changing Education 
(“Changing Edu”). 73  Changing Edu operates a website that helps match tutors with students.  
The company was founded in 2013.  TAL’s April 2015 investment was part of a Series B+ round 
that brought Changing Edu’s total venture funding to approximately $30 million.74  Four months 
later, in August 2015, TAL wrote a much bigger check to Changing Edu –purportedly $30 
million cash in Changing Edu’s Series C round.   
 


TAL has a national tutoring business called “One on One”.75,76  When TAL reportedly invested 
the $30 million in the C round, it also purportedly transferred its Guangzhou One on One (“GZ 
1-1”) business to Changing Edu at a valuation of $50 million.77  Changing Edu issued TAL $50 
million of redeemable preferred shares as purported consideration.78  TAL claims it transferred 
the GZ 1-1 business as part of this larger investment in Changing Edu.   


 
When TAL claimed to have disposed of the “Guangzhou after-school one-on-one tutoring 
business component”, it did not transfer a corporate entity.79  Instead, it appears to have 
transferred only a (likely small) portion of contracts related to the business – predominantly 
employment contracts for administration personnel.  On the other hand, our diligence found that 
Changing Edu established a new entity in May 2015 to supposedly own the GZ 1-1 business.  
That entity was called Guangzhou Shujia Education Technology Co., Ltd. (Shujia).80  Later, a 


																																																								
73 Changing Edu is a Chinese internet company whose niche is matching K-12 students with teachers who make 
home visits to conduct one on one tutoring.  Changing Edu is an overseas holding company with VIE operations in 
China. It was established in late 2014 by Liu Changke and received early investment from IDG, Trust Bridge, TAL, 
Sequoia Capital. As of the end of TAL’s FY2017, TAL was the largest individual outside investor.  In Chinese, 
Changing Edu’s is called Qingqing Jiaoyu (轻轻教育) or Qingqing.73  The VC investment tracking website 
Crunchbase calls this company Qingqing Jiajiao.. In this document it will primarily be referred to as Changing Edu, 
but in interviews or source documents it may be referred to as Qingqing. 
74 TAL FY2016 20-F, p. F-66, TAL notes its first investment of $6.3 million in April 2015 as being part of 
Changing Edu’s B+ round.  
75 TAL 2016 20-F, pp. 45-47 
76 TAL FY2016 20-F, p. F-66. According to TAL the “one on one” tutoring business delivers private and small, 
semi-private class tutoring to students. These “personalized premium services” are mostly offered in a one-on-one 
format, with a small portion of lower priced small-group classes, which typically consist of only two to six students. 
77 TAL FY2016 20-F, p. 44. In TAL’s financial reports, Guangzhou one on one is called “Guangzhou after-school 
one-on-one tutoring” and “Guangzhou Tutoring.” In China, it operates under the names Zhikang (智康), Aizhikang 
(爱智康). In this document it will be frequently abbreviated to “GZ 1-1”, but in referencing interviews or source 
documents we may refer to one of these other names.

TAL reported that just 15 months after the disposal, it was buying back GZ 1-1 at the same price 
because Changing Edu felt that GZ 1-1 “no longer fit with its overall business strategy”.82  The 
consideration for the supposed repurchase was non-cash: merely cancellation of shares 
previously issued to TAL.  (Sino-Forest reported billions of fraudulent sales and profits through 
non-cash transactions.)  Upon reconsolidation, TAL did not reverse its previous $50 million 
gain.83 We believe this was contrived and that these transactions lacked substance. 
 
We suspect that Changing Edu agreed to participate in this scheme because TAL had become a 
significant shareholder.  Moreover, Changing Edu appears to have attracted notice as a top-tier 
venture investment with almost $90 million of “funding” from TAL.84

of $50,000,000 as netting out against $49,999,939 (combined intangible assets: $4.6m student base, -$1.2m deferred 
tax liabilities, and $46.6m goodwill) to just $61.00, almost zero.

How did we learn about Shujia and what did we know about it? 
 
We learned about Shujia from multiple conversations our investigators had with GZ 1-
1 and Changing Edu staff.  In the course of our diligence we also obtained SAIC 
financials and credit reports for Changing Edu’s VIE, Shanghai company, and 
Guangzhou companies. Shujia was established on April 3, 2016.  In our interviews 
with Changing Edu former managers, we learned that Shujia had been planned as a 
“Special Purpose Entity” to be the counterparty in the GZ 1-1 transaction.  In our 
interviews we also learned that TAL was not interested in taking Shujia as part of the 
purported re-acquisition.  Shujia was originally 100% held by Shanghai Qingqing.  
Changing Edu’s co-founder, Guozhi Hu was the original Executive Director and Legal 
Representative.  On January 20, 2016, Guozhi Hu was replaced in these positions by 
Mr. Xiansuo Lin, who had previously acted in a similar capacity for four of TAL’s  
branch offices in Chengdu.  Mr. Lin remained the listed representative for Shujia until 
November of 2017, at which time he was replaced by Changing Edu’s Chairman, 
Changke Liu.  By this time, it appears Shujia had largely become an orphaned 
company.   In January 2018, a local tax office in Guangzhou posted Shujia as among 
its list of “irregular tax payers”, meaning that the company had not kept up with basic 
administrative reporting and tax payment compliance.  After the “re-acquisition” of 
GZ 1-1, Mr. Lin appears to have returned to rejoined TAL in Beijing with a 
promotion.

At the time TAL first invested in Changing Edu, it was already a portfolio company of IDG.85  
Feng Li, whose new venture fund exited Shunshun for 8x in one year, was still with IDG at this 
time.  He appears to have been closely involved in Changing Edu.86

TAL’s Investments into Changing Edu

We infer fraudulent intent pervades the entire chain of events.  We detail 10 reasons why we 
believe the transactions were asset parking and were without substance: 
 


• Personnel who were at GZ 1-1 during the times of purported transfers generally were 
unaware, or disagreed, that ownership had purportedly changed hands. 


• During the period of purported non-ownership, TAL appears to have remained the lessee 
for substantially all the learning centers.   


• It is improbable that TAL transferred a business without transferring cash or deferred 
revenue.  	


• TAL claims it accrued a $12.5 million tax liability in the PRC from the $50 million gain 
on purported disposal.  We were unable to find evidence of this in SAIC financials.   


• We believe that in August 2015, no rational actor would have paid $50 million for GZ 1-
1. 


• If TAL is to be believed, Changing Edu was opening new GZ 1-1 learning centers even 
after it had decided that the business did not fit its strategic direction and decided to 
dispose of it. 


• Websites and recruitment ads from the time of Changing Edu’s purported ownership 
show TAL playing a key role, supporting our view that TAL never relinquished control 
of the business. 


• Shujia’s SAIC filing shows multiple indicia that TAL had effective control of the entity 
when Changing Edu purportedly owned GZ 1-1.   


• Shujia’s CY2015 / 2016 SAIC financials do not accord with the GZ 1-1 business’s 
expected financial performance, indicating that Shujia was consolidating other Changing 
Edu businesses, and therefore likely not fully consolidating the GZ 1-1 business.   


• The amount of deferred revenue TAL purported to have acquired with GZ 1-1 in 
November 2016 is not indicative of a business that Changing Edu was struggling to run.   


 
Independent of the substance of the transaction, we believe that the $9.4 million deferred revenue 
TAL claims to have acquired when it “re-acquired” GZ 1-1 is fraudulent.  Based on the SAIC 
financials for the entity that we believe owns the business, TAL would have recognized 
approximately one-third of the deferred revenue in December, which we do not think is 
plausible. 
 
 
1. Personnel who were at GZ 1-1 during the times of purported transfers generally were 


unaware, or disagreed, that ownership had purportedly changed hands.   
 
Through our investigators’ fieldwork, we learned that the transaction had been structured in a 
highly unusual way that we believe transferred the business in name only (if that) without 
transferring the substance.  Many employees from that time were either unaware that GZ 1-1 
purportedly had a new owner, or they disagreed with the proposition.  Had TAL really intended 
to dispose of GZ 1-1, we would expect that employees would have been aware of the ownership 
change.  Changing Edu appeared to be a high-profile VC-funded company that would not shy 
away from publicity, so the observation that there was so little awareness of its purported
Page 35 of 70	


ownership further supports our view that there was no intention to actually transfer this 
business.89   
 
Our investigators had a detailed conversation with a former Changing Edu manager who was 
familiar with the transaction structure.  He provided key details on the highly unconventional 
transaction structure.  The former manager’s explanations cause us to believe that the transaction 
had been structured so as to 1) give TAL some evidence of a disposal, 2) minimize the burden 
imposed on Changing Edu, and 3) minimize the work involved in the planned re-acquisition. 
In short, those details support our view that this was a shambolic transaction.   
 
It appears that upon purported disposal, TAL assigned to Shujia a small number of the contracts 
underlying the GZ 1-1 business – our impression is that it was mostly administration personnel 
employment contracts.90  Upon purported re-acquisition, those contracts were largely reassigned 
to TAL.  The former manager stated that then-existing student contracts were not assigned to 
Shujia.  The former manager explained that no entity transferred, GZ 1-1 never completely left 
TAL, and it was never completely taken over by Shujia or Changing Edu.  Therefore, important 
problems remained unresolved: namely, prior contracts signed with students, teachers, and 
landlords were not re-signed or transferred.   
 
An excerpt from the conversation provides more color on his commentary: 
 


Q: When Qingqing [Changing Edu] bought Zhikang [GZ 1-1], it was an independent 
company, so Qingqing was the shareholder?   
 
A:  No, it was a business.  A business does not necessarily reside within a legal entity, so 
the point I just made was that the business was brought in.  So, we were bringing this 
business of like 10-plus organizations in, but it did not have a company that was the body 
that was carrying them.  So, at that time it was really complicated. 
 
Q: So about students from that time or their families, for example, were the original 
tutoring contracts changed over to Qingqing? 
 
A: Right, there were discussions of this kind, but in the end, we could not adopt this 
scheme.  If we did there would be risks. Therefore, we avoided it and dropped it. We did 
not implement it.” 
 


Further fieldwork showed this structuring left rank and file personnel largely unaware that GZ 1-
1 had purportedly changed hands twice in recent years.  Our investigators visited all 10 of the GZ 
1-1 learning centers that were in operation at the time of the purported disposal.91  Including 
offsite interviews, our investigators spoke with over fifty different people with knowledge of the 


																																																								
89 Per Crunchbase, early investors were Sequoia Capital, IDG, and Trustbridge Partners. 
90 Of all the staff our investigators interviewed, only back office staff stated that they had re-signed labor contracts 
with Changing Edu and/or Shujia.  They generally understood the story to be that Haoweilai invested in Changing 
Edu and gave GZ 1-1 (Aizhikang) to Changing Edu, but Aizhikang operated independently from Changing; and, 
later Haoweilai brought GZ 1-1 back into Xueersi and the TAL group of companies.   
91 The specific learning centers and their addresses were identified by visiting www.waybackmachine.org.
Page 36 of 70	


GZ 1-1 learning centers.  This group includes teachers, staff, parents, Peiyou learning center staff 
(often located on a different floor in the same building), and building management.   
 
When our investigators spoke to teachers present during the period of purported disposal, none 
thought that the GZ 1-1 or the “Aizhikang” business was acquired by Changing Edu.   A few 
stated that the two companies had “a kind of cooperation”.  Some described “Aizhikang” as an 
independent organization, but one that was still under the TAL group brand.92  Below is a 
sampling of comments from the interviews with the teachers and heads of learning centers: 
 


• A teacher who worked at GZ 1-1 (2014-2016) and was paid by Xueersi (TAL) 
throughout the period who was asked about Changing Edu:  
 
“In 2015 [GZ 1-1] used cards to track students, each learning center and student had a 
card, which showed Xueersi’s brand, then around September 2015 they started using a 
cell phone app from Changing Edu in place of the card.  They used it for about three 
months and then changed back to using a card again.”   


 
• A teacher who worked at GZ 1-1 (2016) whose contract was signed with Aizhikang / 


Haoweilai (TAL) who was asked about the Changing Edu acquisition: 
 
“But it was still Aizhikang and part of [TAL]…Guangzhou was independent for a while, 
unlike other cities, not a branch company.”  


 
• A learning center staff member during a site visit to the Huangsha learning center who 


was asked whether GZ 1-1 changed hands: 
 
Q: I see it seems like you’re very familiar with the operation. How long have you been 
working here? 
 
A: I’ve been here for a few years. 
 
Q: A few years? 
 
A: Yes, a few years’ time. 
 
Q: I saw online that this... your "1 on 1" was sold to Qingqing [Changing] Education? 
 
A: No, now we are Xueersi, now all of our financial receipts are "Xueersi." 
 
Q: So you were brought back, or were you bought back? 
 
A: This is a senior level matter, so I’m not clear about it. 
 
Q: I saw online, Xueersi did not change. It seemed one-on-one was sold to someone. 


																																																								
92 As was shown in a job advertisement in a prior section, this confusion appears to be because Shujia was 
specifically marketing itself as “Aizhikang” and misrepresenting itself as being a part of the TAL brand.
Page 37 of 70	


 
A: I’m not familiar with this, we and Xueersi are the same group, we are all part of the 
Haoweilai group. 
 


• A learning center staff member during a site visit to the Huayi learning center: 
 


Q: I thought I saw online that there was some cooperation with Qingqing [Changing] 
Education? 
 
A: There was before, for a brief time in the middle, but later it came back to the Group. 
 
Q: Some kind of good relationship, it seems like they bought it back? 
 
A: Seems like it could be, but I’m not clear about this, it’s all decided at the senior level. 
 
Q:  Right, doing that kind of back and forth. 
 
A:  As far as these kinds of company things go I don’t know too much. 
 


The directors of the learning centers our investigators interviewed appeared to know a bit more 
about the relationship with Changing Edu, but they were very reluctant to talk.  None affirmed 
there had been a purchase by Changing Edu, or a repurchase by TAL.  They quickly, almost 
reflexively, described the relationship between Changing Edu and GZ 1-1 as “cooperation.”  
When our investigators asked specific questions about contracts or the particulars of the 
Changing Edu cooperation or transaction, the conversations would quickly go from congenial to 
cold.  We take this as an indication that they had been instructed or even threatened not to speak 
of the matter.  Two excerpts from interviews with heads of learning centers are below.   
 


• A former Guangzhou Changing Edu teacher (2015-2016) and now head of a GZ 1-1 
school since 2016, when asked about the Changing Edu acquisition replied that:  
 
“You can’t call it ‘bought’, you can’t call it ‘bought’.  It was just kind of cooperation.” 
 


• A former GZ 1-1 Head of School (2012-2016) when asked about the Changing Edu 
acquisition replied that:  
 
“It was not purchased, there was just cooperation.” 





2. During the period of purported non-ownership, TAL appears to have remained the lessee for 
substantially all the learning centers.   


 
TAL’s CFO claims to have transferred 10 learning centers to Changing Edu, but SAIC files show 
only one lease was assumed by Shujia.  This does not appear to be a clerical issue.  The former 
Changing Edu senior manager confirmed that few learning center leases were transferred.  A 
filing in a PRC lawsuit shows that over a half year after the purported disposal, TAL renewed
Page 38 of 70	


and pre-paid another full year’s rent on a GZ 1-1 learning center.  If TAL were merely acting as 
an agent to pay the rents on Changing Edu’s behalf, then related party transaction disclosures 
with specifics would have been required.  Yet, no such disclosures exist. 
 
In the FY2016 Q3 earnings call prepared remarks, CFO Rong Luo announced that all 10 of the 
GZ 1-1 learning centers had been transferred to Changing Edu.  He stated, “We exchanged 10 
one-on-one learning centers in Guangzhou to Changing location, following the agreement signed 
in June 2015.”93  TAL’s investor presentations from FY2016 Q3 also show that all 10 of the 
Guangzhou One-on-One Centers had been removed.  The images below show the reduction from 
FY2016 Q2 to Q3, dropping from 10 to “ – “. 
 


FY2016 Q2 Investor Presentation 





FY2016 Q3 Investor Presentation 


	
 
Shujia’s SAIC files show that in December 2015, the lease for one GZ 1-1 learning center, the 
Quzhuang learning center on the 6th floor of the Guangdong Huaxin Center building, was put 
into Shujia’s name.94  The space leased was just 929 m2, at a monthly rate of Rmb 65,959 
(approximately $10,000), and required a deposit of Rmb 138,513.  This site also became Shujia’s 
new registered address.95  It is located in a space next to one of TAL’s Peiyou Quzhang Service 
Centers.96 
 
When fraud is committed through proxy interest holders in China, we have found it is common 
for the physical locations of the proxy to be in or near those of the controlling parent.  While 
moving Shujia’s official registered address into a former GZ 1-1 learning center might make 
sense from the perspective of taking over a business, it also fits the pattern of TAL keeping 
Changing Edu in close proximity (i.e., “on a short leash”).  Changing Edu had other Guangzhou 


																																																								
93 TAL FY2016, Q3 earnings call.  
94 Shujia’s SAIC files 
95 We believe that the fact this became its registered address and that it is located next to a TAL facility are both 
salient.  First, Chinese companies are required to formally lease the space that they occupy as their registered 
address and provide a lease agreement to the SAIC as proof of such.  Therefore, we see a reason for the change here.  
Second, moving Shujia’s main offices into former TAL GZ 1-1 space and adjacent to one of TAL’s Peiyou service 
centers is consistent with the view that TAL retained effective control of Shujia throughout the period of disposal.

businesses and could have consolidated its Changing Edu operations into one location 
independent of TAL. 
 
This is likely the only learning center Shujia took over.97  In the interview with the former 
Changing Edu senior manager, we learned that leases at many, if not most, of the learning 
centers were not transferred from TAL to Shujia.98  Details within a 2016 Chinese lawsuit 
independently corroborate that TAL not only continued to lease GZ 1-1 learning center space 
after the time of the purported disposal, but was also paying the rent in advance. 
 
In April 2016, when the GZ 1-1 Tianhe Huayi Learning Center supposedly belonged to 
Changing, TAL subsidiary Tianhe Xueersi prepaid rent in the amount of Rmb 6.2 million 
(almost $0.9 million) for the period from April 1, 2016 to March 31, 2017.99  Excerpts from the 
lawsuit are below in Chinese. Some of the relevant points from the lawsuit include: 
 


• The location and area: The Tianhe Trade Building on the 3rd and 4th Floors.100  
 


• This matches GZ 1-1’s learning center address for the 3rd floor.  The 4th floor is for 
TAL’s Peiyou training center (school). 


 
• The lease term:  The lease between Huayi and TAL started April 1, 2015 with a term of 


eight years.   
 


• The payment terms:  The rent should be prepaid in annual increments by March 5 each 
year. 


 
• TAL made a payment to the landlord for the period of April 1, 2016 through March 31, 


2017.  	
	





																																																								
97 As will be discussed in a subsequent section, in an interview with a former Changing Edu senior manager, we 
learned that leases at many if not most of the learning centers were not transferred from TAL to Shujia.   
98 More from this interview is discussed above. 
99 As reported in the credit report files for Guangzhou Xueersi Education Technology Co., Ltd files, Case Reference

Shujia’s SAIC financials support the view that only one learning center lease was ever 
transferred from TAL.  As established in the lawsuit, one year’s lease expense for a single 
learning center of 2,345 m2 could be over Rmb 3 million per year or Rmb 300,000 per month.  
Deposits could be equal to two or more months of rent.  The site leased in Shujia’s name was 
929 m2 .  Its monthly rent was just Rmb 65,959 and required a security deposit of Rmb 
138,513.101  From our site visits, we found that the learning centers ranged in size from 20 to 50 
classrooms, and use approximately 500 m2 to 1000 m2 of space.102   
 
Shujia’s SAIC financial statements show prepayments of only Rmb 3,000 as of December 31, 
2015.  It therefore appears that no learning center deposits were transferred to Shujia nor paid in 
the four months in CY2015 immediately after Changing Edu supposedly took over GZ 1-1.  As 
such, we believe TAL continued to pay the leases for most if not all of the other nine learning 
centers transferred.   
 
Because TAL was an investor in Changing Edu, if it acted as a rent payment agent on behalf of 
Changing Edu, it would have been a related party transaction that we understand mandated 
disclosure.103   
 
 


																																																								
101 Per the lease agreement contained in the Shujia SAIC files 
102 The larger leases covering several thousand square meters involved both the larger Peiyou learning centers and 
the smaller 1-1 learning centers. 
103 TAL FY2017 20-F, p.106; FY2016 20-F, p. 111: For FY2016 and 2017, TAL reports loans, prepayments, and 
advances to related parties, but does not provide detail or which related party was the beneficiary or whether the 
amounts due were for the loans, advances, or other transactions. As at Feb 29, 2016 the current amounts due totaled 
US$2.59 million and $1.34 million non-current. The loans were made to three different parties. As at Feb 28, 2017 
TAL had $3.4 million in current amounts due from related parties.  Additionally, the total deposits and lease 
payments for the learning centers would very likely be far in excess of these amounts. Therefore, we do not see an 
indication that prepayments made by TAL but not transferred and/or lease payments made by TAL on behalf of 
Shujia were reported fully and properly, if reported in any form at all.

Audit Failure: TAL’s Missing Related Party Disclosures  
 


TAL’s related party disclosures generally fail to provide required detail.  Opacity is the friend 
of fraud, and in this case is a failing on the part of Deloitte. In FY2016 and FY2017, TAL’s 
related party disclosures do not identify the counter parties associated with current balances 
due, the nature of the transaction, nor the dollar amounts of the transactions themselves as 
required by ASC 850 
 
ASC 850-10-50-1:  The disclosures shall include:  
 


a. the nature of the relationship(s) involved,  
b. a description of the transactions, including transactions to which no amounts or nominal 


amounts were ascribed, for each of the periods for which income statements are presented, 
and such other information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the 
transactions on the financial statements,  


c. The dollar amounts of the transactions for each of the periods for which income statements 
are presented and the effects of any change in the method of establishing the terms from that 
used in the preceding period, 


d. Amounts due from or to related parts as of the date of each balance sheet presented, and, if 
not otherwise apparent, the terms and manner of settlement...” 


 
TAL’s disclosures fall far short of meeting the requirements for the transactions involving 
learning center leases, teacher payments, and student tuition.  Given the large number of 
investees in which TAL holds an interest for which it provides little or no detail, we suspect 
these findings represent only a small portion of larger systemic problems.
Page 42 of 70	


3. It is improbable that TAL transferred a business without transferring cash or deferred 
revenue.   


 
We would have expected TAL’s accounts to reflect cash and approximately $5 million of 
deferred revenue liabilities transferred to Changing Edu along with the disposal.  However, 
TAL’s accounts show neither was transferred.  GZ 1-1’s deferred revenues arose from students’ 
pre-payment of tuition, and are a liability because GZ 1-1 still needs to deliver the service.  The 
cash would have largely resulted from pre-payments, and would have been used to fund the 
ongoing delivery of the services (e.g., teacher salaries, lease payments, and utilities).  Not 
transferring these items suggests the bank accounts, the cash collected from the students, as well 
as the student contracts remained with TAL, yet GZ 1-1 would have had cash in- and outflows on 
a daily basis.  The lack of deferred revenue and cash transfer reinforces our view that TAL was 
merely parking GZ 1-1 at Changing Edu with no intention of actually relinquishing control of the 
business.   
 
US GAAP requires the parent company to remove all of the assets and liabilities related to the 
subsidiary or the group of assets from its book when control ceases.  We checked TAL’s 
financials and could see no cash outflow or reduction in deferred revenue on TAL’s books at the 
time of the purported disposal. 
	
First, we can see that TAL transferred no cash to Changing Edu.  TAL’s statement of cash flows 
from investing activities in FY2016 shows no cash outflow specifically related to the 
disposal/transfer of GZ 1-1.105  Per our understanding of accounting practices, cash transferred in 
connection with the disposal should be shown in an account distinct from TAL’s equity 
investments in Changing Edu – in other words, it should not be added to any consideration paid 
for TAL’s long-term investments.  (Rather, transferred cash would normally be disclosed as a 
cash outflow due to a business disposal or transfer.)  However, as can be seen in the investing 
section of TAL’s FY2016 cash flow statement below, no such outflow was recorded. 





																																																								
105 2017 20-F, p. F-8
Page 43 of 70	





 
Second, we can see that TAL transferred no deferred revenue to Changing Edu.  Reconciling the 
FY2016 balance sheet to the cash flow statement evidences no changes to the deferred revenue 
account as a result of the disposal of GZ 1-1.  Based on TAL’s description of GZ 1-1’s 
operations, we would have expected to see about $3.3 million to $5 million (or more) of deferred 
revenue moving to Changing Edu if the disposal was carried out as a bona fide transaction.106 





																																																								
106 In the TAL FY16 Q2 earnings call, CFO Rong Luo provided enough data to estimate GZ 1 on 1’s revenue for the 
quarter preceding the purported transfer would be about ~$2.5 million.  This calculation is detailed later in this 
section.  In the course of our fieldwork we learned GZ 1-1 would seek to collect four to six months tuition in 
advance.  Therefore as ~2.5 million equated to the recognition of revenue in 3 months, then even at zero growth, at 
least $3.3million, but more likely around $5 million or more in deferred revenue should have transferred. 


Audit Question 
 
Was Deloitte aware that TAL’s overly simplistic preparation of cash flows does not 
conform with U.S. GAAP requirements for foreign currency translation?
Page 44 of 70	


 
 
 
4. TAL claims it accrued a $12.5 million tax liability in the PRC from the $50 million gain on 


purported disposal.  We were unable to find evidence of this in SAIC financials.   
 
The gains and tax accrual TAL claims in its SEC filings do not appear in its SAIC financials.  
TAL did not disclose which entity booked the purported gain and tax, but it stated that it was one 
of its VIEs.  We checked the financials of the VIE that we believe held the GZ 1-1 business, but 
found no such accounts.  To be thorough, we check the financials of TAL’s other disclosed 
Guangzhou VIEs, but again came up empty.  Finally, we checked the financials of TAL’s three 
major Beijing VIEs that might have held GZ 1-1, and again none of them evidence the claimed 
amounts.   


 
TAL claims it accrued a PRC tax liability equal to 25% of its purported $50 million gain on 
disposal, which would have been $12.5 million.    
 


“Income tax expense was USD 33.5 million in fiscal year 2016 compared to USD 9.4 
million in fiscal year 2015. The increase was mainly due to accrued one-off income tax 
expense of USD 12.5 million related to gains from disposal of one-on-one business in 
Guangzhou and…we used the Guangzhou one-on-one business as investment in 
Changing Education to exchange their stake. So this is kind of a disposal in accounting.  
So we gained $50 million gain from there, and we need to apply 25% tax rate over there, 
which is a kind of special case.”

China’s Enterprise Income Tax rate is 25%.  Luo’s statement was codified in TAL’s FY2016 Q2

6-K claims its VIEs collectively accrued a tax liability of the appropriate size.107  TAL’s FY2016 
20-F confirmed the VIEs booked the gain and tax accrual.108   
 


	
		 Source: TAL FY2016 Q2 6-K 
 
The most obvious entity to have booked the gain and tax is Guangzhou Xueersi Education 
Technology Co. Ltd. (“GZ XRS EdTech”), which we believe held the GZ 1-1 business.  Its 
SAIC files show a branch company network whose addresses matched six of the ten GZ 1-1 
learning centers, and former GZ 1-1 employees confirmed it was the operating entity.  TAL’s 
annual reports also explain that its “personalized premium service” (one-on-one tutoring) 
businesses are not operating through schools, but companies. 109  GZ XRS EdTech is the only 
disclosed entity in Guangzhou that operates education consulting businesses.  Therefore, we 
believe GZ XRS EdTech is the VIE that would have shown the gains and losses of the transfer.  
However, its financials show no indication of the gain or tax accrual 
 
To be even more thorough, we then fruitlessly reviewed the SAIC financials of the other three of 
TAL’s disclosed Guangzhou VIEs for signs of this transaction (listed below).110  These schools 
are each licensed training centers.  
 


• Guangzhou Yuexiu District Xueersi Learning School (Yuexiu School) 
• Guangzhou Tianhe District Xueersi Learning Center (Tianhe School)111  
• Guangzhou Liwan District Xueersi Learning Center (Liwan School) 


 
We checked the SAIC financials of three other Beijing VIEs.112  Their financials as shown in 
their credit reports also show no sign of the disposal.   
 
The 2015 SAIC for GZ XRS EdTech and TAL’s three other Guangzhou entities are below.113

The lack of evidence for both the gain and tax accrual in SAIC financials, MoE financials, and 
credit reports support our conclusion that the boomerang of GZ 1-1 was fraudulent asset parking 
and lacked substance.
Page 47 of 70	


5. We believe that in August 2015, no rational actor would have paid $50 million for GZ 1-1.   
 
As discussed above, we believe GZ XRS EdTech operated the GZ 1-1 business.  TAL made 
additional disclosures that support our belief, and confirm that a $50 million claimed sale price 
fails the laugh test.  During the call on which the purported disposal was announced, Rong Luo 
guided to GZ 1-1’s quarterly revenue having been approximately $2.5 million, or $10 million 
annualized.114  This adds support to our belief because GZ XRS EdTech reported CY2015 
revenue close to that amount: RMB 66.7 million.115 
 
TAL therefore purports that Changing Edu bought GZ 1-1 at a current-year PE ratio of over 
150x.  As shown above, from January through July 2015, GZ XRS EdTech showed net income 
of only $0.17 million.  If we annualize that, the number becomes $0.29 million.116  The entity’s 
operating / pre-tax / net margin was only 1.1%.  At the time, TAL traded at a PE ratio of roughly 
35x on a net margin of 15.3%.117 
 
 
The $50 million price tag is also surprising when compared to TAL’s carrying value of the 
business of zero.  (The table presenting TAL’s changes in fair value in Changing Edu can be 
used to calculate that TAL recorded $50.0 million as the consideration for GZ 1-1.118)  Because 
both the consideration and the reported gain were $50.0 million, we know the carrying value 
(i.e., the value of the net assets) was zero.  While it is not impossible for net carrying value to be 
zero, it is improbable – even more so considering that GZ 1-1 had just expanded.  Just prior to 
the August 2015 disposal, TAL stated it even added a new learning center, its tenth, so these new 
assets would not have had much accumulated depreciation.119  Presumably new students had 
signed up for the fall and winter sessions as well, so new additions to the student base (intangible 
asset) were also being made.  In short, in such a dynamic situation, the probability of the carrying 
value being zero is also close to zero.  This claim seems highly questionable. 
 
An even bigger question, though, is: if this had been a real disposal, why in the world would 
TAL agree to take it back at the same price?  That would be like winning the lottery and then 
throwing away the ticket before collecting the winnings. 


																																																								
114 FY2016 Q2 earnings call, CFO Rong Luo, “…our revenue from one-on-one in Guangzhou was around 10%, 9% 
in Q1 and 11% in Q2, of the overall one-on-one revenue” and “One-on-one performed better than expected, 
contributing to 13% to the overall revenue in Q2."  FY16 Q2 revenue of $173.33 million x 13% x 11% = US$2.48

6. If TAL is to be believed, Changing Edu was opening new GZ 1-1 learning centers even after 


it had decided that the business did not fit its strategic direction and decided to dispose of it. 
 
TAL’s timeline has it reacquiring GZ 1-1 in November 2016.  However, Changing Edu began 
increasing the store base by about 30% seemingly as it was deciding it wanted out of the 
business.  During the period Changing EDU purportedly owned GZ 1-1, the number of learning 
centers also reportedly increased from 10 to 14.120   One of the new learning centers opened at 
the end of November 2016 (before GZ 1-1’s purported return), and two more opened in February 
2017.121  In total, three of the four new learning centers opened after ownership purportedly 
reverted to TAL, implying that Changing Edu had committed to opening these locations around 
the same time it decided to dispose of the business.   Assuming Changing Edu really did not 
want to continue to run the business, such incremental investments would have been illogical. 
 
 
7. Websites and recruitment ads from the time of Changing Edu’s purported ownership show 


TAL playing a key role, supporting our view that TAL never relinquished control of the 
business. 
 


One of the first red flags we came across was the http://gz.jiajiaoban.com website, which showed 
no evidence that TAL had disposed of GZ 1-1.  Online teacher recruiting ads from the time also 
show TAL having significant ongoing involvement. 
 
The jiajiaoban.com domain is a TAL-owned domain.122 Using the waybackmachine, we 
retrieved historical versions of the website from different points in time during the purported 
disposal.  The website continued to list GZ 1-1 among TAL’s brands, and the GZ 1-1 portion’s 
“about us” page continued to feature only TAL (formerly known as Xueersi) during the period of 
supposed non-ownership.  There were no indications of Shujia or Changing Edu, nor any

Looking at the details in the ads for teachers below shows us that the people responsible for

May 2016, eight months after the purported disposal: 
 


 
 
 
The teacher recruitment ad below shows Shujia marketing itself as GZ 1-1 and still as part of 
TAL, or specifically as “Aizhikang” and under the “Haoweilai” (TAL) brand flag.  In the job 
posting, the Haoweilai / Aizhikang name is the headline. Guangzhou Shujia appears below it in 
smaller print as if it is a local subsidiary.  The job description again opens with the Haoweilai / 
Aizhikang name.  The company description states its name is Guangzhou Shujia then explains 
that “The Aizhikang Guangzhou branches and the Haoweilai Group share educational, market,
Page 52 of 70	


and brand resources, integrating educational resources, fusing internet technology and 
education.” 
 
The ad goes on to describe the Haoweilai Group’s national network and closes by stating 
“Aizhikang is Haoweilai’s (previously known as Xueersi) Brand”.126,127   
 
Changke Liu, the founder of Changing Edu, appears at the bottom as the legal representative of 
Guangzhou Shujia, but there is no suggestion GZ 1-1 is outside of Haoweilai or actually belongs 
to Changing Edu.128   








																																																								
126 For those not able to read Chinese we point out a visual trick in the way this sentence is constructed.  Literally 
this reads as:  Aizhikang is Haowelai (formerly known as Xueersi) under the brand flag of”.  Since Chinese 
grammar can be simplified and an apostrophe is not necessary, the reader first reads “Aizhikang is Haoweilai” with 
the rest about the old brand name and the part about “under the brand flag of” following innocuously like run of the 
mill marketing copy. 
127 TAL FY17 20-F, p.43, TAL previously operated under the name Xueersi.  Its NYSE ticker was “XRS”.  “In 
August 2013, we changed the name of TAL Education Technology (Beijing) Co., Ltd. to Beijing Century TAL 
Education Technology Co., Ltd. In addition, we changed our umbrella brand from “Xueersi” to “Haoweilai.”

TAL’s ongoing involvement in recruiting teachers for GZ 1-1 is another indicator that TAL 
never really relinquished control of its GZ 1-1 business. 
 
 
8. Shujia’s SAIC filing shows multiple indicia that TAL had effective control of the entity when 


Changing Edu purportedly owned GZ 1-1.   
 
Shujia was established in May 2015, about three months before the officially stated date for the 
transfer of GZ 1-1 to Changing Edu.  Not long after the transfer, TAL’s fingerprints are in 
evidence in Shujia’s SAIC file.   
 
The first piece of evidence comes in Shujia’s 2015 and 2016 SAIC filings.  Both Shujia’s 2015 
and 2015 SAIC Annual Reports display a TAL e-mail address as its contact email: 
gzzk_xb@100tal.com. They also show the website Shujia reported as its company website was: 
http://gz.jiajiaoban.com.  The jiajiaoban.com domain is a TAL-owned domain.129

Shujia’s SAIC files divulge that just over four months after the purported “disposal” of GZ 1-1, a 
TAL senior manager, Xiansuo Lin, joined Shujia as a minority shareholder, its Executive 
Director, and more importantly, its Legal Representative.130  After the purported re-acquisition, 
we learned from an interview with a former Changing Edu manager that Mr. Lin returned to 
TAL, accepting a promotion and a posting with its corporate operations in Beijing. This appears 
to be corroborated by a recent Chinese news article that describes his position as a Brand 
Manager for the one-on-one business.131  We believe that Mr. Lin was TAL’s proxy at Shujia. 
 
																																																								
130 According to China’s SAIC filings, Xiansuo Lin had been a well-known teacher in the Xueersi operation in 
Chengdu, and had risen to become a regional manager. In Chengdu, he was the listed as the legal representative for 
four different TAL branches.

9. Shujia’s CY2015 / 2016 SAIC financials do not accord with GZ 1-1 business’s expected 


financial performance, indicating that Shujia was consolidating other Changing Edu 
businesses, and therefore likely not fully consolidating GZ 1-1 business.   


 
Shujia’s CY2015 revenues were less than one-third of what we would have expected, and its 
deferred revenue fell short by half.  Its CY2016 financials displayed irregularities and did not 
match up with expected levels.  As at December 31, 2016, one month after purportedly returning 
GZ 1-1 (purportedly including its assets and liabilities) to TAL, Shujia still showed deferred 
revenues on its books.  This implies Shujia’s financials consolidated other Changing Edu 
business, not GZ 1-1. 
 
During the period of the purported disposal, Changing Edu had three entities running in 
Guangzhou.  Guangzhou Qingqing (its online tutor matching platform), Guangzhou Shujia, and 
Guangzhou Zhidian (set up later to operate a new venture, the “Sharing Schools”).  We reviewed 
SAIC financials of all three Changing Edu entities (shown in Appendix G).   
 
 
Shujia’s 2015 Revenue and Deferred Revenues: 
 
Shujia’s 2015 financials show revenue was too small to be consolidating the GZ 1-1 business.  
On the 2016 Q2 earnings call, Rong Luo advised that GZ 1-1’s quarterly revenues as of August 
2015 were approximately $2.5 million.132  Even with flat growth, in the final four months of 
2015, we should see revenue of approximately Rmb 21 million.  However, Shujia’s SAIC 
financials report only Rmb 5.75 million in 2015 or ~28% of the expected amount. 133   
 
In contrast, GZ XRS EdTech’s total revenue reported in CY2015 of Rmb 66.7 million (see 
Appendix F) is close to the estimate of Rmb 63.2 million ($10 million) below for GZ 1-1’s run 
rate.  
 
The table below displays the calculations, currency conversion, and works out an annualized 
revenue run rate based on the FY16 Q2 (Aug 2015) data.

133 Shujia’s credit report
Page 56 of 70	


 
 
The relationship between Shujia’s year-end deferred revenue and subsequent-year recognized 
revenue is inconsistent with our understanding of how GZ 1-1 operates, supporting our view that 
Shujia was not consolidating all of the GZ 1-1 business.  In our field visits and interviews with 
staff and managers involved with GZ 1 on 1, we found that the learning centers normally 
collected four to six months of prepayments (deferred revenue).  The table below shows that in 
other major cities, the prior year’s collection of prepayments (deferred revenues) provided 35% 
to 40% of the following year’s revenue.  Shujia, however, collected only 17.8%. 
 
City Entity(ies) Percentage 
Beijing Huanqiu Zhikang, Zhixuesi Beijing 38.7% 134 
Shanghai Shanghai Xueersi Training Co. Ltd. 135 35.6% 136 
Shenzhen Shenzhen Xueersi Ed. Tech. 137 39.9% 138 
Guangzhou Guangzhou Shujia139 17.8% 140 


 
One month after purportedly returning GZ 1-1 to TAL, Shujia ended CY2016 with a deferred 
revenue balance of Rmb 31.8 million.  At the same time, TAL reported that it had acquired a 
significant amount of deferred revenue on the re-acquisition: Rmb 65.2 million.  The balance 
remaining on Shujia’s balance sheet once again implies that Shujia was consolidating something 
other than GZ 1-1.  To the extent we are correct, it could imply that TAL’s accounts continued to 
reflect at least some of GZ 1-1’s business.   
 
We suspect Shujia was consolidating other Changing Edu businesses, possibly Guangzhou 
Qingqing, for the following reasons:   
 
																																																								
134 (Rmb mm) 2015 deferred revenue: 121.9, 2016 revenue: 315.0 
135 Shanghai Xueersi Training Co., Ltd, credit report 
136 2015 deferred revenue: 43.0 to 2016 revenue: 120.7, ratio of 1:2.8 
137 Shenzhen Xueersi Educational Consulting Co., Ltd, credit report 
138 2016 deferred revenue: 42.8 to 2017 revenue: 107.3, ratio of 1:2.5 (CY2015 financials were unavailable.) 
139 Guangzhou Shujia Educational Technology Co. Ltd., Credit Report 
140 2015 deferred revenue: 12.6 to 2016 revenue: 70.7, ratio of 1:5.6
Page 57 of 70	


 
• The vast majority of Shujia’s 2015 and 2016 revenue match up with the value of its 


“other receivables.” This suggests that Shujia was not simply recognizing tuition revenue 
from its accumulated pre-paid tuitions, but its revenue was coming from third party(ies) 
and collected at a later date. 


 
• In 2015, Guangzhou Qingqing reported $3.5 million (Rmb 22.2 million) in revenue. The 


next year, its revenue dropped to almost zero; however, Qingqing continued to operate its 
online tutor matching business in Guangzhou.  Although we do not believe Guangzhou 
Qingqing has a robust business, it did not disappear – it is active even today.141  We 
suspect that in 2016, its revenues might have been temporarily moved over to Shujia.142 


 
• Shujia and the other Guangzhou businesses carry very low cash balances.  While the 


balance sheet represents only a point in time, we find it peculiar and possibly significant.  
If Shujia were operating GZ 1-1, with or without TAL’s assistance, we expect it would 
need to hold more cash than shown on the balance sheet.  The cash should be building up 
like a war chest that would go not just to future expenses, but also its planned growth.  


 
• Guangzhou Zhidian was the entity initially used for Changing Edu partner Guozhi Hu’s 


new experiment in the Sharing Schools, “Sishujia”.  In 2016, Guangzhou Zhidian showed 
very little activity.  However, it appears that 10 or more Sharing School locations had 
been set up in Guangzhou in 2016.143  Because it was opening new Sharing Schools, we 
would expect Guangzhou Zhidian’s accounts to show greater activity.  Shujia meanwhile 
does report Rmb 3 million of “construction in process” at the end of CY2016.  Since the 
GZ 1-1 businesses would have transferred out such assets, these should reflect the 
development of another “bricks and mortar” business.  As such, we believe it might be 
possible that the business activities we see in Shujia might incorporate certain activities 
that were nominally for the Sharing Schools.144  





																																																								
141 https://www.changingedu.com/guangzhou 
142 Shujia now appears to be an orphaned company and was listed by the local tax authorities to be an “irregular tax 
payer”.  Being an online business, it is possible that its sales have moved on and are being recorded by another of 
Changing Edu’s online business entities. 
143 https://fudaoquan.com/p/12746.html，An article from May 2016 article notes that close to 30 were established 
and 60 were planned by August 2016.  However, hyperbole is rampant among start-ups, especially in China.   A 
former Changing Edu manager we interviewed, stated that 10 to 20 Sharing Schools (originally under Changing 
Edu’s Zhidian company) were set up on CY2016. 
144 Hu Guozhi departed Changing Edu in 2016 and brought the Sharing Schools (Sishujia) with him into a new 
entity. Changing Edu’s Liu Chang Ke has continued to support him through investment, and he and TAL’s Zhang 
Bangxin are Directors at his new venture. http://epaper.21jingji.com/html/2017-06/02/content_63534.htm
Page 58 of 70	


10. The amount of deferred revenue TAL purported to have acquired with GZ 1-1 is not 
indicative of a business that Changing Edu was struggling to run.   


 
Upon the purported re-acquisition, TAL claimed to have acquired $9.43 million in deferred 
revenue.  This is a fair value of the liability, so the actual amount of deferred revenue would 
likely have been higher.145  (TAL disclosed that the accounting for the purchase price allocation 
had been determined by the group and with the assistance of an outside valuation appraiser.146)  
Because GZ 1-1 was described as a low-margin business, we believe that its gross margin was 
less than 30%, and likely less than 15%.  We estimate that the carrying value of deferred revenue 
– i.e., the prepaid tuition that had been collected – would have been $10.5 million (Rmb 72.5 
million) to $13.5 million (Rmb 93.2 million).147  We use $10.8 million (Rmb 75 million) in our 
subsequent estimates. 
 
As the table below shows, were the margins higher, the difference in carrying value would have 
been even greater.  Even at a low margin, we are highly skeptical that Shujia’s GZ 1-1 could 
have generated $9.43 million in deferred revenue.  The low-end estimates of the carrying value 
of GZ 1-1’s deferred revenue exceed Shujia’s full-year revenue of Rmb 70.7 million, which 
supposedly would have included 11 months of GZ 1-1 operation.  This also assumes all of the 
revenue Shujia reported was from GZ 1-1 and had no additions in December.   
 
 


 
 
If the reported deferred revenue number is not fraudulent, it implies that the business was 
ramping with a large number of new student tutoring contracts.  These circumstances seem 


																																																								
145 Per ASC 805, deferred revenues are typically given a hair cut in this process with the discount being a function of 
the additional cost to deliver the service and fulfill the contract.  GZ 1-1 would still need to pay teachers and other 
ongoing operational expenses.  Although claimed to be a low-margin business, expenses such as marketing or pre-
paid rents would be eliminated, and the deferred revenue should be adjusted downwards; therefore, if this discount 
was correctly applied, then the pre-discounted deferred revenues and the revenue run rate required to generate them 
would have been much higher.  In short, if we assume ASC 805 was applied, the difference between the financial 
performance we see in the SAIC financials and the required revenue run rate would be even larger.   
146	FY2017 20-F, p. F-49	
147 Assuming a low gross margin of between 10% and 15%, the carrying value would have been about Rmb 75 
million.  If we used 26.5% gross margin implied by Shujia’s CY2016 SAIC financials, the carrying amount would 
be higher – approximately Rmb 89 million.
Page 59 of 70	


inconsistent with the purported rationale that Changing Edu felt GZ 1-1 was poor strategic fit for 
its tutoring business.   
 
 
The $9.4 million Deferred Revenue Purportedly Acquired with GZ 1-1 Seems Fraudulent 
 
SAIC financials for GZ EdTech cause us tosuspect that the $9.4 million deferred revenue TAL 
reported buying with GZ 1-1 is fraudulent.  As of November 30, 2016, TAL reports the fair value 
of the deferred revenue acquired was US$9.43 million (Rmb 65.2 million). However, one month 
later TAL’s SAIC financials for the GZ Ed. Tech Co. display a pre-payment (deferred revenue) 
total of just Rmb 42.1 million.148 
 


 SEC, 11/30/2016: Deferred Revenue RMB 64.9 million ($9.43 million) 
 Est. of Adjusted Carrying Value Deferred Revenue RMB 75 million ($10.9 million) 149 
 SAIC, GZ Ed. Tech Co, 12/31/2016: Pre-payments Rmb 42.1 million ($6.13 million) 


 
If TAL’s GZ Ed. Tech Co. acquired the deferred revenue, it would have booked the carrying 
value of approximately Rmb 75 million.150  Although the deferred revenue balance prior to the 
purported buyback at GZ Xueersi Company is unknown, the balance at year end, just one month 
later, is.  Its SAIC financials show it was just Rmb 42.1 million, or about half of the estimated 
carrying value of the purportedly transferred deferred revenue.  
 
To achieve this reduction, at least Rmb 33 million would need to be recognized in a single month 
and no new prepayments from new or returning students could be accepted throughout 
December.

Could GZ 1-1’s December 2016 revenue have been Rmb 33 million?  That seems highly 
improbable.  


 
In the table below, we use company-provided data to calculate the pro forma revenue that TAL 
acquired from all acquisitions in FY2016.  In total, the maximum revenue GZ 1-1 could have

company for the GZ 1-1 business before the purported disposal, and based on interviews with former GZ 1-1 and 
Changing Edu employees, we believe this was unchanged after the purported return. 
149 The carrying value is applied here because the fair value adjustment will be made at the consolidation level. 
150 The lowest possible end of the range for the carrying value would be at zero gross margin, equating to Rmb 65.2 
million.  Even at this level, the claimed deferred revenue is twice that reported by GZXRS EdTech at year end.

accumulated over the nine months prior to the acquisition (and assuming ZERO revenue from 
other acquisitions, like Shunshun and Yaya) was $19.64 million.151,152  
 
The average monthly GZ 1-1 revenue would be at most only Rmb 14.7 million, less than half of 
the Rmb 32.9+ million draw down needed to cover the difference between our low-end estimate 
of the deferred revenue’s Rmb ~75 million carrying value and the Rmb 42.1 million shown on 
the SAIC files as at December 31, 2016. 





 
 
In the spring of 2018, GZ XRS EdTech’s CY2017 financials became available.  This company, 
which we believe operates GZ 1-1, reported revenue of only $9.8 million (Rmb 65.8 million).  
This is much lower than we would expect from the purported deferred revenue of $9.4 million 
(Rmb 65.2 million).  The deferred revenue amounts are pre-payments collected over four to six 
months, and are recognized when the tutoring sessions are provided. They should be a key 
indicator of the business size and revenue run rate.  Were the $9.4 million in deferred revenue 
real, GZ XRS EdTech’s CY2017 revenue should have been two to three times larger (about $19 
million to $30 million).153 
 
 
Conclusion:  
 
With the help of a Changing Edu., a related party, TAL boosted profits and revenues in FY16, 
FY17, and FY18.  The repurchase of GZ 1-1 with its $50.0 million gain was instrumental in 
adding $37.5 million to the bottom line in FY16 and converting profit compression into profit 
growth. The deferred revenues we believe TAL continued to recognize after the 2015 disposal

152 Proforma –reported revenue = pre-acquisition revenue of acquired companies (this calculation assumes that Yaya 
and Shunshun provide zero revenue – however both had revenue in FY2016 prior to their acquisitions, therefore we 
consider the calculation below to be very conservative.)	
153 If the $9.4 million in deferred revenue was already adjusted per ASC 850, then we estimate carrying value would 
be roughly Rmb 75 million, in which case the FY2017 revenue should be $22.3 to $33.4 million (Rmb 150 to 225 
million).

flowed into its top line and down to its bottom line in FY2016 and FY2017.  TAL’s claim to 
$9.43 million in deferred revenue upon the purported buyback appears to be largely if not 
entirely fraudulent and likely booked at 100% margin.  We believe these gains would primarily 
have been recognized in FY2018. 
 
We believe that GZ 1-1 was never truly disposed of as described by TAL. TAL retained the 
student contracts and revenues after the purported transfer and continued to pay most of the 
teachers and learning center lease payments.  As such, TAL’s claim to $50 million in gains upon 
disposal appears fictitious.  Our reviews of Shujia’s business during the period of the alleged 
disposal find that Shujia’s 2015 revenue and pre-payments were too small to accord with the size 
of the GZ 1-1 business it was said to have been given, while its 2016 financials appear to be 
comingled with other Changing Edu businesses.  Even then, the claim to $9.43 million in 
deferred revenue returning with GZ 1-1 would mean the pre-payments it collected exceeded its 
full year revenue by ~50%.   
 
After assessing the numerous red flags and contradictions claimed by TAL, we conclude that 
TAL’s purported transfer and requisition of GZ 1-1 was a sham.  Although Changing Edu set up 
a new company, called Shujia, which was supposed to be managing this business, in substance 
the GZ 1-1 operation seem to have never fully left TAL’s control.
