I cannot help analyzing this unusual event. Accountingwise, there is no effect as of now,
since the revenue contribution from the those projects are immaterial. Giant may show
better GAAP net income because half of the loss from those companies at this early
stage will be burdened by the new equity owners, the teams. Capital market is unlikely
to count in that effect, though, and will actually price Giant pro forma, so that it is not
going to affect Giant's stock price in the near term.  


In the future, if any one of the daughter companies has a hit game, Giant will get 51% of
the net income, which is a smaller percent than if it does not spin off the daughter
companies. Apparently Giant is betting on having a smaller cut on a much bigger pie. By
having those companies stand alone, Giant hopes that one of them will turn into another
giant, a typical venture capitalist thinking mode.  


Somehow I do not have a good feeling about this move, which seems a bit unusual and
extreme. Yuzhu Shi, the CEO of Giant, had a problem in managing the firm after he
successfully brought the firm to the Nasdaq market. He commented a few times about
how the employees became much better off and lost interest in working hard. Shi
launched a new game, Giant Online, named after the company, but it failed to become a
hit, much due to the lack of devotion and imagination of his team. Shi figured that he
should have the teams back into the entrepreneurial mode, and hence he moved to an
extreme: having the teams bear as much risk as they possibly can. 


One question that naturally came up is why hadn't all other companies done this if this
were such a good way to align interests. Certain attrition is removed, but at the same
time certain synergy is removed as well. The best form of company is to have as many
hardworking employees as possible working for the same goal, and it is questionable if
a project team possesses the necessary elements of a successful company. The way
Giant Online reorganized its company structure could be premature. 


The president of Giant commented that "if the daughter companies perform well and
reach the standard to go public, we will support spinoffs". It is another dangerous
thought in my view, and I hope that it was expressed just for encouraging the daughter
company leaders. The capital market does not welcome one-trick ponies; the best way
for both Giant and a daughter company to benefit is for Giant to swap stocks with the

daughter company if the daughter company ever becomes successful.  


In my previous article about Giant, I suggested shorting Giant based on its accelerated
revenue decline. My theory is still intact. Giant has been so far running inside a
downward channel. It looks like that the downward pressure is not going to be lifted any
time soon. I expect further price drop from here, but I am going to close my minor short
position with the next dip, giving Giant the benefit of the doubt.  


Giant is on a risky move. If it succeeds, Giant's fate may be changed. If it fails, Giant will
become a dwarf. I am not optimistic for Giant, but I do wish it success in its endeavor.  


Disclosure: Short GA. 


I don't typically talk about my long positions but I do talk about the stocks that I either don't like or do not like
enough.
