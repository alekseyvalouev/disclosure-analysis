Like Madoff, TRE is one of the rare frauds that is commit-
ted by an established institution.  In TRE’s case, its early 
start as an RTO fraud, luck, and deft navigation enabled it 
to grow into an institution whose “quality management” 
consistently delivered on earnings growth.  


TRE, which was probably conceived as another short-lived 
Canadian-listed resources pump and dump, was 
aggressively committing fraud since its RTO in 1995.


The foundation of TRE’s fraud is its convoluted structure 
whereby it runs most of its revenues through “authorized 
intermediaries” (“AI”).  AIs supposedly process TRE’s tax 
payments, which ensures that TRE leaves its auditors far 
less of a paper trail.


On the other side of its books, TRE massively exaggerates 
its assets.  We present smoking gun evidence that TRE 
overstated its Yunnan timber investments by approximately 
$900 million.


TRE relies on Jakko Poyry to produce reports that give it 
legitimacy.  TRE provides fraudulent data to Poyry, which 
produces reports that do nothing to ensure that TRE is 
legitimate.


TRE’s capital raising is a multi-billion dollar ponzi scheme, 
and accompanied by substantial theft.

Introduction 


As Bernard Madoff reminds us, when an established institution commits fraud, the fraud can 
become stratospheric in size.  Sino-Forest Corp. (“TRE”) is such an established institutional 
fraud, becoming massive due to its early start, luck, and deft navigation. At nearly seven billion 
dollars in enterprise value, it will now end.  


TRE started humbly – as a fraudulent company going public on the Toronto Venture Exchange 
via reverse takeover (“RTO”).  Sixteen years later, Muddy Waters would be exposing its US-
listed imitators – companies such as RINO, DGW, ONP, and CCME.  It seems impossible that a 
Chinese RTO coming public in 2010 could ever get to where TRE did.  But for many years, TRE 
sat barely noticed on the Toronto exchange.  It was committing fraud from the very beginning; 
but, there were not enough similar frauds to raise investors’ awareness.  


Then in 2003, it changed its business model – moving to a level beyond standard capex schemes 
that most China frauds run.  Its new model, purchasing trees, gave it limitless room for growing 
its fraudulent balance sheet and vacuuming up money from the capital markets.  At the same 
time, China was becoming a major investment theme.  TRE became more sophisticated – 
engaging Jakko Poyry to write valuation reports, all the while giving Poyry manipulated data and 
restricting its scope of work.  Thus more and more investors are drawn into TRE’s fraud every 
year as it falsifies timber investments and manipulates Poyry further.  At some point, TRE 
became an institution – a seasoned stock with “quality management” that consistently grew 
earnings over more than a decade.  


Were Muddy Waters not to have come along, it is likely that this fraud could have continued for a 
few more years and billions of dollars more.  Solving this fraud was not easy.  In order to conduct 
our research, we utilized a team of 10 persons who dedicated most to all of their time over two 
months to analyzing TRE.  The team included professionals who focus on China from the 
disciplines of accounting, law, finance, and manufacturing.  Our team read over 10,000 pages of 
documents in Chinese pertaining to the company.  We deployed professional investigators to five 
cities.  We retained four law firms as outside counsel to assist with our analysis. We are confident 
that we have brought more expertise, time, and money to bear in analyzing TRE than has any 
investor or bank – by a substantial margin. 


Executive Summary 


Sino-Forest Corp (TSE: TRE) is the granddaddy of China RTO frauds.  It has always been a fraud 
– reporting excellent results from one of its early joint ventures – even though, because of TRE’s 
default on its investment obligations, the JV never went into operation.  TRE just lied. 


The foundation of TRE’s fraud is a convoluted structure whereby it claims to run most of its 
revenues through “authorized intermediaries” (“AI”).  AIs are supposedly timber trader customers 
who purportedly pay much of TRE’s value added and income taxes.  At the same time, these AIs 
allow TRE a gross margin of 55% on standing timber merely for TRE having speculated on trees.  
The sole purpose of this structure is to fabricate sales transactions while having an excuse for not 
having the VAT invoices that are the mainstay of China audit work.  If TRE really were 
processing over one billion dollars in sales through AIs, TRE and the AIs would be in serious 
legal trouble.  No legitimate public company would take such risks – particularly because this 
structure has zero upside.
Page 2 of 39!


TRE avoids disclosing the identities of all but one of its AIs “for competitive reasons.”  The one 
AI we know it has disclosed (at a credit analyst event in April 2011) is actually a connected party 
– to both TRE and one of its agents.  Despite TRE’s opacity on the revenue side, we have 
overwhelming evidence that the $231.1 million in Yunnan province timber TRE claimed to sell is 
largely fabricated.  Such amount exceeds TRE’s real timber holdings in Yunnan province.  It 
exceeds the applicable harvesting quotas by six times.  Transporting the harvested logs would 
have required over 50,000 trucks driving on two-lane roads winding through the mountains from 
this remote region, which is far beyond belief (and likely road capacity).  


On the other side of the books, TRE massively exaggerates its assets.  TRE significantly falsifies 
its investments in plantation fiber (trees).  It purports to have purchased $2.891 billion in standing 
timber under master agreements since 2006.  We have smoking gun evidence from Yunnan 
province that it overstated its purchases there by over $800 million.  Of the five agents we have 
been able to identify (TRE does not provide Chinese names), Yunnan appears to have the only 
legitimate agent.  The other agents have histories and connections to TRE that make it obvious 
they did not purchase billions of dollars in timber for TRE.  Further, the other agents appear to be 
laundering money for TRE – moving large amounts of money to an undisclosed subsidiary of 
TRE and a trading company that TRE does business with.  We also see clear evidence that TRE 
has falsified its books – Chinese government records make clear that TRE would have had a 
capital hole of $377 million to $922 million if it were making the investments it claims.   


TRE then feeds the fraudulent data to Poyry, while allowing Poyry access to only 0.3% of its 
purported timber holdings.  TRE touts the valuation reports as evidence of its credibility.  One 
fresh example occurred at TRE’s annual general meeting on May 30, 2011.  At the meeting, CFO 
David Horsley emphasized to the shareholders in attendance that Poyry teams spend “six personal 
weeks” in the field for the valuations.  On a June 1, 2011 telephone call with analysts to discuss 
the Poyry report, Poyry clarified that four men spent six days in the field, which the Company 
calculates is approximately six man-weeks.1  Fortunately, it appears that in 2011 Poyry is 
becoming somewhat cautious about TRE using its name to bilk investors out of billions of 
dollars, and it has accordingly restricted how TRE may use the report.   


TRE’s claims to be “transparent” are interesting.  Its offshore structure, which utilizes at least 20 
British Virgin Island entities, is an unjustifiable black hole.   


Auditors are far less effective in detecting fraud than most investors assume they are.  The 
problem is that fraudsters are willing to forge documents.  We show a suspicious letter from 
HSBC that was written on behalf of one of TRE’s main subsidiaries, Sino-Wood Partners.  We 
submitted this document to HSBC’s department of fraud risk.   


Another issue with auditors detecting fraud is that when the auditors are based in Canada, and the 
fraud is in China, the auditors are far less versed in the games fraudsters can play in China.  As 
CCME and LFT show, even China offices of “Big Four” auditors have a number of issues 
detecting fraud.  For most of its time as a public company, TRE’s auditors have been Ernst & 
Young out of Canada.  In TRE’s case, the auditor problem morphs into another significant issue – 
that of TRE’s poor corporate governance.  TRE’s board of directors appears to be the retirement 
plan for former Ernst & Young partners, and its audit committee members all fail PRC political,

industry, and cultural knowledge tests.2  A favorite trick of Chinese RTO frauds is to gain 
credibility by putting Westerners without Chinese skills or background into management or onto 
the board.  TRE probably pioneered the practice.  


No fraud is complete without the payoff.  Its constant capital raising is a multi-billion dollar ponzi 
scheme.  We see some evidence of how TRE is stealing the hundreds of millions of dollars that 
have entered the PRC.  Its financial tunnels include an undisclosed subsidiary that seems to act as 
a magnet for payments from many of TRE’s disclosed PRC subsidiaries and the agents that 
purportedly purchase timber for TRE. 


Valuation 


Because TRE has $2.1 billion in debt outstanding, which we believe exceeds the potential 
recovery, we value its equity at less than $1.00 per share. 


Sino Forest Equity and Debt Estimated Values 


Sino-Forest has raised a total $3.05 billion from the capital markets. The capital structure consists 
of $1.892 Billion of bonds outstanding3, Senior Secured Bank Loans of $207 million ($154.0 
million from the Dec 31, 2010 financials and a new CNY 350 mil term facility. This makes debt 
outstanding $2.100 Billion. 


In addition, it has raised $989 million of equity in shares sales going back to May 2004. Due to 
the SAIC filings, we know that a maximum of $1.2 Billion of cash has been injected onshore.  


The Company also has a 63% stake in its listed subsidiary Greenheart Group, however, because 
we have concerns about this company, we do not factor it into our valuation. 


The equity/credit analysis valuation analysis is very difficult as a result of the inability to rely on 
the audited financials and our belief that the company has far fewer assets than it reports.  In 
order to value the equity and the credit, one has to assume one of two scenarios, both of which 
assume an injection amount of $1.2 Billion into China:

Scenario 1: Assets in China are accessible to creditors and shareholders 


If the assets in China were accessible, the first thing that creditors would have to do would be sell 
the small forestry assets that the company has and attempt to recover any cash balances. Given 
the propensity for theft, we will be liberal and assume that the recovery from asset sales and cash 
seizures is 50% of the amount injected – roughly $600 million.  $50 million would be used to pay 
back the onshore RMB denominated debt.  The rest would then need to be repatriated via a 
capital reduction process with SAFE, the Chinese capital account regulator. At an absolute 
minimum, the cost of offshoring this money would be around 15%, giving us a total recovery bull 
case of $467 million.  


The offshore cash is not simply calculated by subtracted cash raised from cash moved into China. 
Management has been liberal with cash compensation. As well, they have spent $54 million on 
their Greenheart stake, $30 million in a consent payment for a bond exchange, and $7 million 
paying off Ms. Chen on the Homix purchase.   If the convoluted BVI structure has yet to be used 
for theft, then the offshore cash balance could be as high as $1.5 Billion (Non-injected cash minus 
management compensation minus offshore acquisitions).  


This gives us an asset base of $1.967 Billion in the best case, which we believe to be unlikely. 
Versus the current outstanding offshore debt of $1.893 Billion, the “real” best case net asset value 
is around $92 million. Divided by the current number of shares outstanding – 245 million - that 
leaves a share value of approximately C$0.38 at current exchange rates.   


Scenario 2: Onshore Recovery of Zero. 


Due to the time involved to actually change the legal representatives and liquidate collateral 
onshore, all the while chasing the cash balances and coordinating with authorities, historical 
precedent should show that there is little that can be done with onshore assets.   


Using the above bull case of offshore assets, we estimate recovery for bondholders would be 
approximately 80 cents on the dollar, with a value of zero for the stock.  Assuming that distressed 
investors target a 15% IRR (again, this would be extremely generous for a distressed Chinese 
credit), the absolute maximum an investor should be willing to pay for the credit is around 69 
cents on the dollar.  The recovery could be higher if less money was put into China.   


Our belief is that the true recovery would be far lower, but without the aid of law enforcement, 
we will never really know how much money is there or where it went. 


I.  TRE Was Always a Fraud.4 


TRE was engaged in aggressive fraud from the time it went public.  Between 1994 and 1996, it 
generated between 65% to 77% of its reported revenues from an equity joint venture5 with the 
Leizhou Forestry Bureau.  All of these numbers were fabricated.  In reality, TRE breached its 
commitment to contribute equity capital to the EJV.  TRE’s conduct so incensed the Leizhou

5 China has two classifications of Sino-Foreign joint ventures: equity joint ventures (‘EJV”) and 
cooperating joint ventures (“CJV”).  The main difference is that in an EJV, profits and assets (upon 
winding up) are distributed in proportion to the parties’ equity holdings.  In a CJV, the parties may contract 
to divide the economics disproportionately to their equity interests.
Page 5 of 39!


Forestry Bureau that it filed with the Zhanjiang City Foreign and Economic Relations and Trade 
Commission (“COFTEC”) a letter containing numerous grievances.  We show this letter and a 
translation in Appendix A5.  This letter and the rest of the EJV’s SAIC file make clear that the 
EJV never achieved the any operation remotely close to that envisioned by the partners or 
described by TRE in its annual reports.  Moreover, the Forestry Bureau accuses TRE of 
misappropriating cash through improper transactions.   


In its 1997 annual report, TRE claims that its Heyuan and Guangxi CJV partners took over the 
(fictitious) wood chip business from the Leizhou EJV – even growing it by 193% that year.  
Considering the base year (1996) revenue was zero, we believe investors should assume that 1997 
results from the CJVs were shy of $16.1 million TRE reported.6   


TRE’s penultimate fraudulent act in Leizhou was to claim that the Leizhou Forestry Bureau 
reimbursed TRE $12.43 million between 1999 and 2003 through a series of payments consisting 
of logs.  This claim that the Forestry Bureau owed TRE in excess of $10 million dollars was a 
gross exaggeration of the facts and contradicts the EJV’s SAIC file, improperly adding $12.43 to 
TRE’s shareholders’ equity.  This type of phantom transaction would become the blueprint for 
TRE’s massive fraud.   


There was another critical outgrowth from the Leizhou EJV.  Upon termination, TRE converted 
the company to a wholly foreign-owned enterprise (“WFOE”).  The WFOE’s business scope7 
included “producing and selling wood products.”  TRE wound this company down in December 
2003.  This is the same year it began telling investors that it used AIs to handle its sales because it 
was not licensed to sell woodchips and wood based products domestically.8  In other words, TRE 
wound down a business that was licensed to sell wood chips; yet, at the same time was stating 
that it was forced to use AIs because none of its companies were licensed to sell woodchips in the 
domestic market.  At that time, the Leizhou WFOE could have utilized this business to take over 
and carry out the proprietary sales of the wood chip and processed wood business. Essentially 
because TRE learned that it could successfully lie about operating a factory with a party known to 
shareholders, it went two steps further – lying about operating a trading business with a party 
unknown to shareholders. 


Leizhou EJV – The Ghost of Ventures Past 


The Leizhou EJV, the Zhanjiang Leizhou Eucalyptus Resources Development Co. Ltd., came into 
being on January 29th, 1994.  TRE subscribed to 53% of the equity, which was to total $10 
million, and the total investment was established at $25 million.  TRE’s obligation was 
straightforward; it would contribute 53% of the investment in cash ($5.3 million) in phases.  It 
was to inject 15% of the registered capital within three months of incorporation, and its portion of 
the balance of the registered capital within two years.  It paid in one million dollars, which left a 
balance of $4.3 million. The Forestry Bureau was to contribute forest assets of 3,533 ha (note that 
this greatly contradicts TRE’s Canadian filings, which state 20,000 ha), and other assets.9   The 
articles of association show that the newly formed entity was created for the specific purposes of:

“Managing forests, wood processing, the production of wood products and wood 
chemical products, and establishing a production facility with an annual production 
capacity of 50,000 m! of Micro Density Fiber Board (MDF), managing a base of 120,000 
mu (8,000 ha) of which the forest annual utilization would be 8,000 m!.”10 


The application included a detailed feasibility study for the MDF board production factory 
including financial analysis, market studies, and production plans totaling over sixty pages.  
Leizhou Forestry Bureau’s expectation was that the factory would generate profit, provide value-
added manufacturing jobs, and introduce new technology and management knowhow.  The 
articles also reveal a plan for the Leizhou Forest Bureau to make additional land available for 
harvesting and replanting that would total 8,000 ha (including the original 3,533 ha).  This 
concept formed the basis of TRE’s “phasing-in” program and was also utilized to inflate TRE’s 
forest rights claims.  However, the EJV never achieved “normal operations”, and neither the plans 
for the manufacturing facility, nor any additional land utilization or forest acquisitions were 
executed.  The signature of TRE’s president, K.K. Poon on the amended articles evidences this 
fact. 11 


The EJV’s 1995 PRC Capital Verification Report (contained in the SAIC file) showed that the JV 
lost $1.1 million (RMB 8,709,107).12  The audit report also shows inventory of only $1,100 
(RMB 9,000), which is hardly the level required to support an operation making weekly 
shipments of woodchips of approximately $400,000, as claimed by TRE.13  By mid-1995, TRE 
had still not injected the balance of investment.  The Forestry Bureau solicited the local 
COFTEC14 to send a formal notification reminding TRE of its obligation.  By the time the 
contribution deadline arrived in January 1996, the TRE management team was incommunicado.15   
After the Jan 29, 1996 deadline lapsed, Allen Chan and Chan Shixing failed to respond to formal 
letters.  They also skipped a Board meeting called to resolve the issues. 16

TRE took a bit of a victory lap in its 1996 Annual Report, when it congratulated itself on the 
Leizhou EJV completing three years of profitable operations.17  Moreover, the Company even 
claimed that the Leizhou EJV carried out $412,000 of research and development that year.18  
According to TRE, it was floating its partner (rather than the other way around) for $15.0 million: 


“The $14,992,000 due from the LFB [Leizhou Forestry Bureau] represents cash collected 
from the sale of wood chips on behalf of the Leizhou EJV.  As originally agreed to by 
Sino-Wood, the cash was being retained by the LFB to fund the ongoing plantation costs 
of the Leizhou EJV incurred by the LFB.”19 


In 1998, the Leizhou Forestry Bureau finally lost its patience and submitted a letter to COFTEC 
containing numerous grievances, and requesting that the EJV be terminated.20   In addition to 
grievances related to the failure to inject capital and develop the MDF board factory as planned, 
the Forestry Bureau accused TRE of improperly removing money and making payments to a third 
party with which the EJV had not done business: 


“After paying one million dollars, the foreign party not only failed to fully fund the 
company, but also approved in its own name the gradual withdrawal of funds in the 
amount of RMB 4,141,045.02 RMB [approximately $500,000], from the paid in capital 
provided by the company for the Joint Venture, among which $270,000 USD was paid 
out to the Huadu Baixing Wood Products Factory (花都市百兴木制品厂)，which has 
had no business relationship with the joint venture at all. This amount of money equals 
47.6% of the money [TRE’s] paid in capital. Although our side has almost entirely paid 
in the capital to which we subscribed (all but 0.9% of the subscription total), because of 
the limited contribution from the foreign party, and its withdrawal of a huge amount of 
money from among those funds it contributed, it is impossible to put into practice the 
project that the joint venture aimed to construct or set up and the intended production and 
business operation activities. This is because the funding has been insufficient and the

foreign party did not contribute the majority of the equity to which it subscribed. The 
joint venture therefore is merely a shell, existing in name only.” 21 


In additional to phenomenally inflating the sales of woodchips from the EJV, TRE planted the 
seeds for a new mechanism that would propel its near infinite NAV growth, and enable it to 
create billion dollar forest accounts out of thin air.   In the 1996 Annual Information Form, and 
that of previous years, TRE claims that the Leizhou JV had already “phased in” 20,000 ha of 
plantation lands from the Forestry Bureau. 22    


However, the Articles of Association clearly stipulate that if the project requires capitalization 
beyond $25 million USD total investment, then the foreign partner would contribute additional 
cash, and the Chinese partner would make additional in-kind contributions in the form of land use 
rights and forest assets.23  Since the project was never fully capitalized, there was no need for the 
Chinese partner to make additional in-kind contributions, and therefore no new forest assets 
would have been added to the venture.  Additionally, the 8,000 ha, were discussed in the Articles 
only in the section pertaining to the long range planning for the company.  Those sections of the 
Articles defining the parties’ respective capital contributions specifically state 3,533 ha (53,000 
mu) as the Leizhou Forest Bureau’s contribution.24  In short, no additional contribution under a 
“phase –in” plan took place. 


In addition to deducing that a scorned government EJV partner would not unilaterally contribute 
additional forest assets to support a manufacturing facility that had never been constructed, there 
is documentary proof that since inception, no significant increases in assets occurred.  The EJV’s 
PRC audit reports from 1995 and 1997 show no change in the intangible assets, under which 
heading forest assets are classified.25  Had an additional 16,500 Ha been phased into the EJV, 
intangible assets would have increased by approximately RMB 86 million.26   


In 1998, the two parties agreed to wind up the EJV.  In the separation agreement, the parties 
agreed that the Forestry Bureau would receive all of the assets the Forestry Bureau originally 
contributed, and TRE would keep the entity and look for a new partner.27 


Interestingly, in its 1997 annual report TRE described the agreement to terminate the EJV as 
entitling it to $12.4 million worth of assets from the LFB.  TRE stated that it would in lieu receive 
payment over three years in the form of 730,440 m3 of standing timber the Forestry Bureau 
owned.28 


Four years later, the 2003 Annual Report includes a claim that the Company completed its 
recovery of open receivables from the Leizhou Forest Bureau with a final collection in the 
amount of $10.2 million in the form of standing timber.29  It is hard enough to collect on a debt

After the exit of the Leizhou Forest Bureau, the Company did not locate a new joint venture 
partner.  In May of 1999, TRE converted the EJV into a Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprise 
(“WFOE”).  In April of 2000, the WFOE’s new scope of business, which included producing and 
selling wood products, was formally approved.30  


However, after receiving approval to reduce the size WFOE’s remaining required capital 
contribution to only $1.4 million,31 TRE still failed to do so for another three years.32  In October 
of 2003, TRE finally wound down the Leizhou WFOE (without having contributed the additional 
capital).  The application for deregistration was made on Oct 28, 2003 and approved by the 
Guangdong Zhanjiang COFTEC on November 4, 2003.33  The key point to note is that in the 
2003 Annual Report, TRE began disclosing that it needed to conduct business through authorized 
intermediaries due to lack of proper licensing, while failing to disclose that in the fourth quarter 
of the year, it was winding down an existing WFOE that had the business scope to do the 
business.34 


How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (by Finding AIs) 


TRE’s initial AI model was that it purported to buy logs, turn them into woodchips, and then sell 
them to customers.  TRE disclosed in 2003 that it had been engaging in this model via its Heyuan 
and Guangxi CJVs.  (TRE makes shameless use of the corporate memory hole.)  


This model appears to be a tortured attempt to create an accounting event for TRE even though it 
risked no capital and moved no physical goods. (TRE would later make this look less tortured by 
creating a third party to the transactions, the agent, which probably made its auditors feel better.)

According to the description in its 2006 annual information of how these transactions worked, 
TRE (through the magic of AIs) booked revenue and profit, but 


• did not commit capital to purchase the logs,  
• did not enter into contracts to purchase the logs from suppliers,  
• did not take title to the logs,  
• did not at any time store (let alone view) the logs,  
• did not commit capital to process the logs into wood chips,  
• did not contract to process the logs into wood chips,  
• did not market the wood chips,  
• did not enter into contracts to sell the wood chips, and 
• did not receive cash from the parties purchasing the wood chips. 


Instead it “agreed to reimburse the costs of the AI, including the cost of the purchase of raw 
timber, and to pay both a processing fee and management fee…”  However, “…all of [the 
aforementioned fees] are deducted from the sales proceeds of the wood chips.”  In other words, 
TRE would not pay any money because the AI would be “reimbursed” when it sold the chips. 


In order to make these transactions into accounting quasi-reality, TRE assumed “all risks and 
obligations relating to the raw timber once it arrives at the premises of the AI until it is processed 
into wood chips, except for any loss arising as a result of the AI’s default.”  As the same filing 
specifies, the AI assumed the risks and obligations of the timber at all other times – from the time 
it is purchased until title passed to the customer.  The below diagram illustrates the purported 
transactions:
Page 11 of 39!





Essentially, TRE’s assumed risk was that a meteor would destroy the wood while at the AI’s 
facility (assuming that the contracts lacked force majeure clauses).  For this invaluable service, 
the AI paid TRE a fee on a “net basis after withholding of applicable taxes by the AI.”  In other 
words, there was no tax documentation that can be used to confirm whether TRE actually 
received any money in this way. 


Believing that TRE actually generated substantial revenue this way strikes us as akin to believing 
in the power of diving rods to find precious metals.  However, TRE was able to apply the same 
principles to a model that allowed it to raise billions of dollars more.  The model is dealing in 
standing timber. 


II. “AI” Really Means “Artificial Intermediary” 


The structure of using anonymous parties that purportedly purchase from TRE without requiring 
TRE to generate VAT invoices allows TRE to invent sales figures without fear of being exposed 
by tax bureau records.  Given that TRE has mostly been audited by accountants based in Canada, 
using this structure to commit fraud takes more audacity than skill.  If TRE really is using an AI 
structure, shareholders should demand management be replaced immediately because TRE is 
running substantial and unnecessary legal risks.  We are convinced that this model does not really 
exist though, so no board meeting to discuss the illegalities of the AI structure is yet necessary.  
As far as we are aware, TRE has disclosed the identity of only one AI, which happened at a 
recent credit analyst event in China.  However, this purported AI’s general manager, Lei 
Guangyu, is part of a web of shadow players spanning the AI, an agent, TRE, and Greenheart.  
He and the AI are closely related to TRE.
Page 12 of 39!


TRE May be a Great Supplier, but How Much Prison Time Would the AIs be Willing to do for 
TRE? 


In a legitimate public company, management would be summarily dismissed for using TRE’s AI 
structure, if it had not already been arrested.  This model would violate fiduciary duties, and 
because it is so blatantly illegal in the PRC, would probably be beyond the scope of D&O 
coverage.  Furthermore, it would be difficult for TRE to find a counterparty willing to work with 
it in this model in size.  The size of the transactions is so large that the AI management would 
possibly be committing offenses that could land them lifetime prison sentences.   


On the other hand, the cure for the problems is simple.  TRE, which already has over 60 wholly-
owned companies in the PRC, could buy and sell timber through new or existing WFOEs (wholly 
foreign-owned enterprises).  It could pay its own VAT and enterprise income tax (“EIT”).  This is 
what practically every other foreign investor with at least $100,000 in its pocket does. 


It is illegal for foreign companies to engage in domestic (i.e., non-import / export) business in the 
PRC without having incorporated a local subsidiary to carry out the business.  The PRC deems 
profits generated by foreign companies doing domestic business without a domestic subsidiary to 
be illegal.  The prior two years of illegal profits are subject to confiscation.  Therefore, if TRE 
were really using this structure for its BVI subsidiaries, they would be risking confiscation of the 
prior two years of their profits. 


As foreign enterprises conducting domestic business in China, TRE’s BVI entities would still be 
subject to the PRC corporate income tax.  TRE’s failure to pay corporate income tax for its profits 
generated in China would subject TRE to penalties more severe than those disclosed.  The 
penalties (on top of the unpaid tax) would be 50% to 500% of the unpaid tax.  There is no statute 
of limitations that would prevent the tax bureau from recovering all of TRE’s unpaid taxes with 
per day surcharges and penalties.   


Because of TRE’s disclosed contingent tax liability of $156.9 million, it is clear that TRE’s 
entities conducting a sizable portion of its business (whether foreign or domestic) are not paying 
taxes themselves under their own tax registration.  Nor are the AI acting in a legal manner merely 
as tax payment agents that pay tax to the tax bureau in TRE’s name.  While such a situation 
would be critical for any company with sizable China operations, because TRE is free cash flow 
negative, such penalty would endanger TRE’s solvency.  Regardless, this is not what TRE is 
really doing.  It is lying about selling such large volumes of timber to the AIs. 


TRE would have numerous problems with the AIs trying to pay TRE’s value added tax (“VAT”).  
Entering names other than the seller of the good on a VAT invoice is a tax crime.  The penalty for 
VAT invoice-related crimes on large VAT amounts can be a lifetime prison sentence for 
managers of companies engaged in this behavior.  We assume that many of these VAT payments 
would be in excess of the threshold to trigger such penalty; therefore, the managements of the AI 
would be risking the sentences in these transactions.  It is difficult to understand how TRE 
generates a 55% gross margin from the AI on standing timber sales all the while risking their 
lives.  TRE does not appear to add that much value. 


TRE and the AIs’ chances of getting away with the scheme would be low.  The PRC banking 
system has controls in place for anti-money laundering purposes.  The tax bureau is part of this 
platform.  We consulted an attorney who is an expert in tax, foreign exchange, and banking 
matters.  The attorney advised us that it is highly unlikely that TRE could have such large
Page 13 of 39!


amounts of RMB sloshing around the banking system without corresponding VAT 
documentation.  Note also as discussed infra in The Capital Hole, TRE’s BVI companies would 
be unable to open up RMB bank accounts.   


Because the AIs are not importing this timber, they would not have customs invoices, and would 
not be able to convert RMB into foreign currency and pay TRE offshore.  While it is possible that 
the AIs could pay TRE offshore from the AIs’ existing offshore accounts, with over one billion 
dollars in payments being made annually, the AIs would likely be left with unmanageable foreign 
currency / RMB imbalances.  Therefore, the banking system and foreign exchange controls would 
likely have long ago ended TRE’s AI business – in an unpleasant way. 


Everybody’s All-Intermediary: Lei Guangyu 


To our knowledge, TRE has only unveiled one AI to investors.  In April 2011, TRE introduced 
credit analysts to Lei Guangyu, who is the president of Shenzhen Hongji Enterprises (Holdings) 
Ltd. (“Hongji”).  Both Lei and Hongji are related to TRE.  At the time that TRE sold its 12.73% 
stake in Greenheart Resources Holdings Ltd. to Omnicorp, Lei Guangyu was the signatory for 
two BVI entities, Fortune Universe Ltd. and Spirit Land Ltd., which held a combined 7.41% of 
Greenheart.  The 2007 audit report from one of TRE’s subsidiaries, Heyuan Jiahe Forestry 
Development Co. Ltd. (“Jiahe”), lists an account payable to Hongji for approximately $400,000 
(RMB 2.7 million) as a related party transaction.  According to the audit report, Hongji’s 
relationship to Jiahe is that they are both subsidiaries of the same parent.  See Appendix BB1.   


Hongji is engaged in irregular transactions with TRE.  One of TRE’s key PRC subsidiaries, Sino-
Forest (China) Investments Co. Ltd. had an account payable of $4.2 million (RMB 35 million) to 
Hongji at the end of 2005.  This is a large amount of money in the context of TRE’s onshore 
transactions that we have been able to see.  Further, it shows a flow of funds opposite of what 
should occur (i.e., AI to TRE).   


We sent a field agent to Hongji’s headquarters in Shenzhen. It has a subsidiary called Gaoyao 
Hongji Panel Co. Ltd..  The legal representative of this company Wang You Wang is the 
signatory on a lease contract for the factory belonging to Guangdong Jiayao Wood Development 
Co., Ltd., one of TRE’s key subsidiaries.  Gaoyao Hongji also appears to be the “arms length” 
purchaser of $30 million in machinery from TRE’s Guangdong Jiayao on March 31, 2009.  
However, the owner of the company that leased the factory from TRE is a TRE and agent 
executive, Lam Hon Chiu.  (We discuss more about Mr. Lam in TRE’s Dodgy Timber Agents.)  
We are not sure what to make of this transaction, but it does not appear to be arms length to us. 


As an aside, it appears that Hongji does not buy domestic timber from TRE.  According to the 
person with whom we met at headquarters, Hongji primarily deals in timber imported from 
Russia and South America.

III. Gengma, Yunnan: Illegal Logging or Fraud?  Timber Sales are Beyond PRC Quota 


According to TRE’s 2010 Management’s Discussion and Analysis, the Company sold $507.9 
million of Standing Timber, of which 45.5% ($231.1 million) of the sales were derived from 
broadleaf trees in Yunnan at an average price of 102 RMB/m!.   This equates to 2,265,000 m! of 
broad leaf timber in the form of “large logs”.35  In TRE’s 2010 Annual Information Form, its 
claimed yield for broad leaf is between 105 to 210 cubic meters per hectare, which means that 
approximately between 10,800 ha (hectares) and 21,600 ha would be required for this sale.  
However, the 2009 Poyry report noted a regulation prohibiting clear cutting of these forests and 
revised the yield downwards by 50%:36  


Poyry has this year become aware that, under current regulations, this crop type cannot be 
clear-felled, but must be selectively logged, with only up to 50% of the volume allowed 
to be removed.  Poyry has consequently adjusted the yield table for the broadleaf crop 
type, from 181 m!/ha to 90 m!/ha to reflect this constraint.37 


At a maximum of 90 cubic meters per hectare, at least 25,000 ha would be required for this sale.  
That is the equivalent of approximately 96 square miles, or one and one half the total area of 
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
35 In the June 2, 2011 Poyry/Sino-Forest joint conference call, the Poyry consultant further specified that 
the high price for the Yunnan broad leaf of $102/m! was for “large logs”

Washington D.C.  The volume required under either yield calculation is enormous and in excess 
of both TRE’s contracted holdings as well as the Lincang region’s local quota.  


First, as described in detail in section IV of this report, TRE’s contracted holdings in Yunnan are 
in Lincang City and amount to only 20,000 ha (300,000 mu, 15 mu = 1 ha), not the 200,000 ha 
claimed by the Company.38   The 25,000 ha equates to 375,000 mu of forest land.39  This 375,000 
mu needed for the transaction is 75,000 mu in excess of its total contracted holdings and also 
ignores any previous depletions made in the years 2009 or 2008. 


Second, the forest area required for harvest exceeds the total area available in the Lincang region 
under the annual quota of both 2010 and 2011 combined.  In China, forest harvests have been 
strictly controlled through a quota system since 2001, with quotas established in the Five-Year 
Plans.  The Provincial Forestry Bureaus proposes the quotas to the National Forestry Bureau and 
the State Council, which have approval responsibility.  The Provincial Forestry Bureau then 
allocates quotas to the local forestry bureaus.  Using the maximum yield estimated by Poyry of 
90m!/ha, the minimum harvest area of 25,000 ha required to complete this sale by far exceeds the 
permitted logging quota for the Lincang City (which includes Gengma county) where the 
Company’s operations and land holdings are located.40  Our local field work in Lincang and 
Gengma, our calls to the Lincang and Gengma Forestry Bureaus, and open source research all 
confirm that this alleged sale of 2,265,000 m! of Yunnan broadleaf exceed the full available quota 
for natural forest (the classification for hardwood broadleaf) of not just the year 2010, or the two 
years of 2010 and 2011 combined, but all of 2010, 2011, 2012, 2012, 2014, and all of 2015!  Our 
field agents contact the Lincang Forestry Bureau for re-confirmation of this fact, and the section 
chief there confirmed that the full years quota for each of 2009, 2010, and 2011 was 376,000 m!. 
41

’11) 376,000 m! 
Years of Quota Req'd to Meet 2010Harvest From 2,265,664 (m!) 6.02 years 


How Much Forest Did Sino-Forest Forest if Sino-Forest Could Forest Forest? 


Even if TRE’s was able to simultaneous arrange unite a network of provincial traders in five 
surrounding regions, including from major competitors with both forests and local mills and 
plants, such as Yunnan Jinggu, Taixing Forestry, and Shanshui Forestry, around the common goal 
of filling TRE’s order, there remain enormous bureaucratic and logistical obstacles. all of which 
could only be achieved through an miracle of political, labor, and logistics worthy of the last 
Great Chairman, Chairman Mao.  


Assuming for a second, that all of the requisite plantation rights, logging permits, and 
transportation permits were properly secured, the actual task of logging still would need to be 
completed.  The 2009 Poyry report explained that the typical harvesting practice in China as 
labor-intensive.  This is especially so because of the required selective logging required for 
Yunnan broad leaf.  Poyry states that, “Trees are typically felled by axe or handsaw, cut to length 


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

39 Chinese land is typically measured in Mu (�).  1 hectacre (ha) = 15 mu.

in the forest and then carried to the roadside by hand.”42  Additionally, Poyry found that logging 
broadleaf in Yunnan would be more expensive than any other region in China because of the 
mountainous terrain and the distances required for carriage of logs to a truckable road.43   In the 
few of the Company’s plots that Poyry visited in Yunnan in 2009, its forest description notes 
frequently indicate that the plots which had the best trees with “good form” or “higher stocking 
and standing volume” were either in places that were “remote”, “several km from the nearest 
navigable road,” or with “slopes [that are] steep up to 35 degrees” making the harvest all the more 
arduous.44   


To understand the sheer magnitude of the task involved, it is important to understand that Yunnan 
is a remote, rugged, mountain province that rises from the mountainous border areas of Burma 
and Laos all the way into the Tibetan Himalayas.  Lincang itself is 92% mountainous, with two 
peaks over 3,000 meters (9,000 ft.), Lincang Snow Mountain and Yongde Snow Mountain, and 
its southern border drops down to the banks of the Lancang river (headwaters of the Mekong) in a 
progressive sequence of mountains and valleys.45  In this rugged geography even the less 
mountainous, or “hilly” areas, would make for a difficult harvest.  The prospect of harvesting any 
sizeable quantity of logs by hand would be daunting, magnifying the inefficiency exponentially.   
This brings us to another major hard constraint in this supply chain: logistics.   


If by some miraculous feat of human labor, the Company’s army of farmers was able to 
selectively harvest the 2.2 million cubic meters of logs, there is the issue of actually transporting 
all of the wood.  The roads through the mountains are dangerous, with switchbacks, steep 
precipices, and even no guard rails in the more remote mountain sections; roads leading into the 
agricultural areas are of a lower quality and often unpaved.46   During the rainy season, which 
lasts from May to October, travel by road is further complicated by mud and occasional 
landslides.  According to a local wood trader in Gengma city, Yunnan, the typical load for a small 
truck is about 20m! and a large truck is 30 m!.  Even if TRE was able to load up all of its trucks 
with 25 m! and 35 m! of logs per load, somewhere between 65,000 to 90,000 truckloads would 
have been required to make the journey to nearest rail station 200 km (120 miles) away, assuming 
no losses of trucks or logs while navigating the precipices and hairpin turns.47 


In short, unless this sale of 2.2 million cubic meters of broad leaf timber from Yunnan was 
fulfilled illegally (in excess of quota and without all of the requisite permits) and accomplished 
with an army of Chinese farmers and shipped out via a secret under-ground train tunnel running 
below the mountains, it either never happened or was grossly over-inflated. 


IV. TRE’s $800 Million Yunnan Scam Shows Timber Holdings are Forged

costing $2.891 billion.  Smoking gun evidence shows that TRE overstated purchases from the

Yunnan agent, Gengma Dai and Wa Tribes Autonomous Region Forestry Co. Ltd.48 (also known 
as Gengma Forestry Co. Ltd. – see Appendix D1), which appears to be a legitimate agent, by 
approximately $800 million.   


The value of purchases made under Yunnan master agreement is overstated by approximately 
$800 million.  TRE announced in March 2007 that it had entered into a master agreement to 
purchase up to 200,000 hectares of plantation trees in Lincang City, Yunnan Province.49  (Note 
that Gengma County is a sub-division of Lincang City.)   


The SAIC file for TRE’s Yunnan entity, Sino-Panel (Gengma) Co. Ltd. and the Lincang City 
Forest Bureau’s 2008 – 2010 Work Completion Reports contain the following documents, which 
we used to understand the real terms of the Yunnan master agreement:

48 This is the agent that TRE refers to as the Gengma Dai and Wa Tribes Autonomous Region Forestry 
Company in its March 2007 announcement of the master agreement. 
49 See Sino-Forest website.
Page 18 of 39!


The approval letters state that TRE has entered into an agreement to acquire 6,667 ha (300,000 
mu) of forest plantation in Lincang City.  TRE acquired 75,000 mu in 2007 from Gengma 
Forestry Co. Ltd.  The Yunnan agent told us that after TRE completed this purchase, it helped 
TRE acquire another 13,333 ha (200,000 mu) in the nearby Lincang counties of Mengding and 
Cangyuan.  Below is a photo of the agent’s office that our field agent took. 








Lest there be any doubt that the approvals omitted the other 160,000 ha that TRE claims is 
covered under the agreement, information about the local economy and forest industry make it 
clear that TRE did not enter into agreements to acquire such a large amount of forest, and at such 
a high per unit price.   


The 2008 Work Completion Report states that Lincang City’s forest industry output was 
approximately $380 million (RMB 2.6 billion). The report also states that the forestry business 
received only $32 million in foreign investment in 2008.  TRE would have represented 80% of 
the forestry GDP for the entire city – let alone county.  It would have invested approximately 
substantially more than the city reports in foreign investment in the industry.  (Again, their main 
operation is in Gengma county, which is a sub-division of the city.)  In the 2009 Report, the 
industry output reached approximately $440 million for the entire city.  More interestingly, the 
report states that the city only issued forest rights concessions of 267 ha (4,000 mu) for the year.  
The 2010 semi-annual report states that as of 2010, Lincang City had issued forest rights 
concessions of 45,526 ha, valued at approximately $50 million. From these numbers, we can see 
that TRE is overstating the per hectare cost by about four times.  Below is the calculation based 
on Lincang City’s numbers:
Page 19 of 39!


$50 million / 45,526 ha = $1,098 per ha 


vs. 


TRE’s claimed purchase price of $4,865 per ha. 


The sheer scale of TRE’s claims regarding its Lincang City, Yunnan transaction contradict reality.  
The Bureau of Statistics of Lincang stated the GDP of Lincang City was $3.1 billion in 2010 
(Appendix D7).  This contract alone would have caused local GDP to grow to four billion dollars, 
making Lincang the next Shenzhen in terms of growth rate. 


From our fieldwork, we were told that Gengma County’s 2010 total GDP was only $475 million.  
If TRE were to be believed, it would have been the vast majority of the entire economy of the 
county. 


Further, we made calls to a local wood product manufacturer that appears to be one of the larger 
such companies in the area.  He is familiar with TRE, and stated that he believes TRE purchased 
about 150,000 mu of plantation forest, which is in line with the documents we obtained.  We 
spoke with a local official at the Gengma County Forestry Bureau who stated that TRE purchased 
50,000 to 60,000 mu of forest.  This range is a decent bit lower than the amount stated in the 
documents.  The constant throughout is that the measurement unit is mu (again 6.7% of a hectare).  


By all indications, the Yunnan agent is a legitimate agent.  At least it is the only agent with a 
relevant scope of business.  Its scope of business includes “wood and wood product purchasing, 
processing, and sales；forestry and forestry-related product planting, purchasing, processing, and 
sales; specialized economic forestry and wood project development and construction…” (“木材
及木材制品收购、加工、销售；林业及林下产品种植、收购、加工、销售；特种经济林木


及制品德基地建设和项目开发…”)   





V. TRE’s Dodgy Timber Agents 


Four Other Agents are Highly Unlikely to Have Sold the $2.9 Billion TRE Claims to Have Bought 


Four other agents are highly unlikely to have sold anything close to TRE’s claim of a combined 
$2.9 billion.  These agents, which would be among the largest private businesses in their locales, 
generally operated out of apartments while purportedly each doing annual revenue in the 
hundreds of millions from TRE alone.   Two of these agents are managed by a senior TRE 
executive, Lam Hon Chiu. 


TRE does not disclose the Chinese translations of its agents’ names.  We obtained the Chinese 
names from PRC audit reports (contained in the SAIC files) of various TRE subsidiaries.  We 
show the various audit report pages with the agents’ names in Appendix E1.  We did not obtain 
the Hunan agent’s SAIC file in time for this report, and we did not find the Chinese name for the 
Guizhou agent.

Guangxi agent: Zhanjiang Bo Hu Wood Co. Ltd. (湛江博虎木业有限公司) 


TRE claims to have entered into a master agreement in December 2007 under which (as of 
December 31, 2010) it has purchased 150,000 ha of plantation for $646.6 million.  We are 
skeptical for the following reasons: 


• Bo Hu was incorporated only one month before TRE entered into this massive contract.  
See the business license in Appendix E2. 


• Bo Hu was thinly capitalized at the time of entering into the agreement – its registered 
capital was only $135,000 (RMB one million) at the time.  Obviously Bo Hu was not 
extending any credit to TRE for the tens of millions of dollars in timber purchases it was 
likely making at a given time.   


• Bo Hu’s scope of business does not include anything related to forest agency (unlike the 
Yunnan agent supra).  Its scope of business at the time of purportedly entering into the 
agreement was “wood products, plywood, glues, paper products, and decoration material 
(木制品，胶合板，胶水，纸制品，装饰材料).  Bo Hu did not add attempt to anything 
relevant to forest agency until September 23, 2008.  See the application to change the 
scope of business in Appendix E2.   


• Bo Hu is incorporated in Guangdong province, and would likely have substantial tax 
issues operating in Guangxi province (due to incessant competition among tax authorities 
in China).  Further, all companies dealing with wood products must have a wood product 
permit issued by the forestry bureaus within the provincial jurisdiction.  Bo Hu’s license 
is for Guangdong – not Guangxi.  See Appendix E3. 


• While purportedly generating hundreds of millions of dollars in annual revenue, Bo Hu’s 
office was in an apartment building in this apartment complex from August 2008 through 
sometime in 2009:
Page 21 of 39!








How many $200 million companies are in this apartment complex? 





Bo Hu’s current office is now in a proper office building, but the high level of security is 
unusual.  On the ground floor, our researcher was stopped by security guards who seemed 
very cautious and alert.  They questioned our researcher regarding why he was there.  He 
was only permitted to enter the building after convincing the guards he had an 
appointment with Bo Hu’s vice president of sales, Mr. Xu.  There was yet another 
security guard stationed outside Bo Hu’s office door on the second floor.  This type of 
security around an office of this size is highly irregular in China.
Page 22 of 39!


• We spoke with a Mr. Xu, who is the vice president of sales for Bo Hu.  He is certain that 
Bo Hu does not deal in Guangxi plantations.  Mr. Xu did say however that Bo Hu is a 
customer of Sino-Panel (one of TRE’s subsidiaries), and has been buying plywood from 
it since summer 2010 in volumes less than $1.5 million annually.  





• Bo Hu’s audit report shows that it has made substantial payments to TRE entities, 
including an undisclosed subsidiary.  (See Appendix E4 & E5.)  As we discuss infra in 
Glimpses of How TRE Steals the Money, we believe that some of these entities may be 
tunnels through which TRE steals investor funds.   





• Bo Hu’s 2008 audit report shows revenue of approximately $37,000 (RMB 250,189) – 
for the sake of clarity, that is thirty-seven thousand dollars.  See Appendix E6.  It is 
inconceivable to us that Bo Hu would be able to understate its revenue by over $200 
million (or 99.9%) – at over $200 million in annual revenue, Bo Hu would be one of the 
larger privately-owned businesses in Zhanjiang.  It would not be able to avoid booking so 
much revenue, in which case the revenue in the audit report would reflect much larger 
amounts. 





Fujian Agent  
 


• Zhangzhou Lu Sheng Forestry Development Company Limited (漳州
盛林��展有限
公司) was incorporated on Nov. 19, 2007 (Appendix E7), just nine months before TRE 
entered an approximately one billion dollar (RMB seven billion) master contract with it.  
 


• The registered capital was only $78,000 (RMB 550,000) (Appendix E7).  





• The registered address was at Floor 1, No. 7 Xibian Hongyang New Village (Orchid 
Garden), Shan Cheng Village, Nanjing County (南靖�山城�溪�宏洋新村（�花园
）7号 1�) until November 29, 2010 (Appendix E10).   This address is the personal 
residential address of Mr. Wang Rui Mei (Appendix E8), who is also listed on the SAIC 
filings to be the legal representative, executive director, supervisor, and manager of the 
company (Appendix E11).
Page 23 of 39!





• A copy of the master agreement signed by TRE and Zhangzhou Lusheng was found in 
the Sino-Panel (Fujian)’s SAIC files (Appendix E9a-E9g).  It is a contract with a total of 
seven pages with no terms regarding liability – it seems to be an unlikely billion dollar 
contract.  Interestingly, the contract stated that as of the time signing the contact Lusheng 
has already been authorized by the owners of 200,000 Ha of the forests in Fujian to act on 
their behalf.  However, Lusheng did not have any wood or forestry related license at the 
time it entered into the contract.  





• We sent a team of field agents to visit Zhangzhou Lusheng in Fujian.  Our agents located 
the new registered address at 5th Floor, Jiamao Honey Industry, No 362 Construction 
Road, Shancheng Town, Nanjing County (南靖�山城建�路 362号嘉�峰�大厦 5
楼)。

Field enquiries confirmed that Zhangzhou Lusheng operates at the address on the 5th 
floor.  There are four desks in Zhangzhou Lusheng’s office, which appeared to be 
approximately 180 m2 with 5-6 employees in the office at the time of visit.  This implies 
that Lusheng has an extremely efficient computer system (given that it processes so much 
money and so many payments with a small staff).

Unit Head Mr. Ma there.  Mr. Ma claimed that he has not heard about Zhangzhou 
Lusheng nor has he heard of Wang Rui Mei.

Tongdasheng.
Page 27 of 39!





• China Square is a company registered in both Hong Kong and BVI with Lam Hon Chiu 
as its legal representative, it seems to be a shadow actor on TRE’s behalf to setup 
undisclosed but related subsidiaries in China.  


• By looking at the SAIC file of Jiangxi Zhonggan’s Chinese partner Nanchang 
Tongdasheng, we don’t see any reason for its existence except that TRE needs a Chinese 
name to legally register a joint venture as its agent in Jiangxi.  Tongdasheng was 
incorporated November 3rd, 2006, with a registered capital of 500,000 RMB. The 
registered address is a fishing village near Nanchang city 南昌市西湖区桃花���村. 
The business scope is Domestic Trading 国内�易 (Appendix E16).  According to the 
2009 Annual Check Report in the SAIC files that the revenue of Tongdasheng for 2009 is 
USD 14,909.84 (RMB 104,368.93) with a net profit of USD 326.58 (RMB 2,286.07).  It 
is nearly impossible for such a company to invest on its own with USD 1 million to setup 
Jiangxi Zhonggan with China Square unless someone else is “funding” the amount.

The 2008 and 2009 Jiangxi Zhonggang’s audit report shows numerous large transactions between 
the Company, TRE, and other parties.  However, none of these transaction is forestry related. 


VI. The Capital Hole 


Chinese government records show a capital hole that makes claimed timber purchases impossible. 


China imposes capital controls that ensure there are records of significant movements of foreign 
currency into China.  From TRE’s PRC company SAIC files, it is clear that TRE’s cash needs in 
China outstrip the capital it has contributed to its China operations by at least $377 million, and 
possibly quite more.  China’s capital controls prevent TRE from funding its operations from 
outside of the PRC by purchasing trees through payment of foreign currency.   


When an existing PRC company wants to bring foreign currency into China as investment in the 
business, it applies to the Ministry of Commerce, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange, 
and the State Administration of Industry and Commerce (“SAIC”).  Once the authorities approve 
the application, the company may bring in the approved amount of foreign currency.  When an 
investor forms a new foreign-owned company, it must specify foreign currency it will invest.
Page 29 of 39!


The authorities will review the entire establishment application, including the portion requesting 
the right to bring foreign currency into China.50   


A given company’s SAIC file shows records current within a few months of all applications for 
injecting equity capital.  Further, PRC law requires equity capital injections to be verified by PRC 
licensed accountants.  The amount of debt a company can borrow is limited by law, and SAIC 
records reflect the amount of money that a company is approved to borrow from offshore.  
However, debt injections are not recorded in SAIC files.  We totaled up all of TRE’s actual equity 
injections and approved debt injections (again, the debt capital is not verified, but we gave TRE 
the benefit of the doubt), and the amount of capital that went into TRE’s PRC operations is only 
$1.213 billion since 1994.  Its investments were $1.7 billion larger than its operating cash flow 
during this period.  (Note that these figures also exclude the need for operating cash.)  Therefore, 
TRE has a capital hole of $377 million to $922 million.  It could not have purchased the trees it 
claims to have. 





Cash flow numbers from Bloomberg. To be conservative, we assumed that all short-term 
borrowings were onshore. 


TRE could not have funded its business with foreign currency.  If TRE were going to pay the 
supplier in foreign currency, it would be illegal unless the goods sold were for export.  Because 
the investments are not for export out of the PRC, the sellers would not be able to obtain customs 
declarations.  Large amounts of foreign currency hitting the sellers’ bank accounts without 
accompanying customs declarations would be quite risky for the sellers just on a one-time basis – 
such a transaction could lead to inability to convert the currency, and issues with the customs and 
tax bureaus.  We do not believe that TRE found suppliers willing to engage in transactions with 
such large risks throughout its 16-year reporting history.  Therefore TRE could not have made 
these investments by paying the sellers in foreign currency in the PRC. 


TRE’s agents under the master purchase agreements are thinly capitalized (see infra TRE’s 
Dodgy Timber Agents).  They could not have each funded hundreds of millions of dollars in 
undocumented currency swaps done through offshore bank accounts.  


!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Business in China for Dummies” (Wiley 2007), chapter 9.
Page 30 of 39!


TRE’s only means of funding these investments would have been by injecting investment capital 
into its own PRC companies, which it did not do in sufficient amounts.  Therefore, TRE’s 
claimed investments and revenues are fraudulent. 


VII. TRE’s Manipulation of Poyry Reports 


TRE’s abuse of Poyry’s name is well-illustrated by a recent statement that TRE CFO David 
Horsley made at the annual shareholders’ meeting on May 30, 2011 that Poyry teams spend “four 
to six personal weeks” in the field evaluating TRE’s holdings.  On a June 1, 2011 call the 
statement was clarified to mean that a team of four people each spends six days in the field, so 
that the total approximates six man-weeks of work.  (Amusingly reminiscent of Bill Clinton’s “I 
did not have sexual relations” comment.) 


Since 2003 Poyry (Beijing) and its Shanghai branch have been engaged to conduct reviews of 
TRE’s operations and value its assets; however, Poyry’s purpose is only to estimate the market 
value of the forest assets based on information provided by TRE, and not to perform due 
diligence or confirm the ownership of the forest areas.51   In numerous locations throughout the 
reports, Poyry adds disclaimers, stating: 


• Poyry has not viewed any of the contracts relating to forest land-use rights, cutting rights, 
or forest asset purchases 52  


• It is important to understand that this is not a confirmation of forest ownership, but rather 
a verification of the mapped and recorded areas of stocker forest.53 


However, despite a generally favorable report, Poyry nevertheless cannot hold back a degree of 
astonishment at TRE’s unusual trading practices, describing in the reports opening paragraphs 
that TRE’s forest holdings are “dynamic” (emphasis provided by Poyry).54  Poyry states, “Unlike 
most forest owners and managers, Sino-Forest actively trades in forests.  Each year the company 
both sells and buys forests, and accordingly the composition of the forest estate changes much 
more than for a business that is simply managing and harvesting a more static resource.”55   This 
fact greatly complicates its inspection and valuation process as “the composition of Sino-Forest’s 
estate can change quite significantly from one year to the next.”56    


Certainly such dynamic trading complicates inspection and verification activities, as it is 
tantamount to a giant shell game.   With a maximum of only 53% of existing 2008 forest being 
carried over into 2009,57 it is easy to disclaim any specific accusation of lack of forest rights 
ownership in any given plot or region.

In introducing its methodology for assessing risk into the discount rate calculation, 2009 Poyry 
explains that the valuation of forest crop assets faces challenges, including: 


• The reliability of forest descriptions 
• The accuracy of yield prediction 
• Achieving high growth rates in a consistent manner58 


The Poyry report explains that its review of forest land holdings consisted of selecting 66 cluster 
maps that represented only 1,611 ha of forest, or only about 0.3% of TRE’s claimed 491,000 ha.59   
During the June 1, 2011 conference call, Poyry revealed that the figure for the 2010 assessment 
was only 0.1% of estate holdings due to the substantial increases in newly acquired plantations.  
Poyry further reveals that current yield tables for these forests have not been properly 
established.60  Poyry has performed some field studies and collected sample data from various 
plots, but its statistical analysis comes with the caveat that “in comparison with most other 
forests, the large Sino-Forest estate is significantly under-sampled for growth and yield 
purposes.”61  In short, due to the poor quality of data and documentation on the forest plot, until 
there is an opportunity to both verify the forest’s physical characteristics and use satellite imagery 
on all forest claims, that the sample sizes are too small to establish significance.  Poyry and all 
investors then can only take TRE at its word that the remaining 99.9% of its purported holdings 
are accurate in terms of their size, yield, and composition. 


Do You Think a 2.5% Risk Premium on TRE’s Discount Rate for WACC Seems a Little Low? 


Poyry’s 2009 report includes an appendix detailing the calculation method for the discount rate, 
WACC, and CAPM; wherein the consultant, Dr. Mardsen, from the University of Auckland’s 
Dept. of Accounting and Finance of the School of Business, provides details on formulas used to 
value a generic forest asset in the China.  Dr. Mardsen repeatedly emphasizes the need to keep in 
mind the additional risk associated with developing markets, such as capital controls, political 
instability, corruption, poor accounting and managerial controls, an uncertain legal framework 
and lack of protection of investor property rights; and factor a premium onto the discount rate of 
the cost of capital, stating: 62 





In China and in emerging markets the level of corporate governance may vary 
significantly between companies.  Corporate governance is important as it provides 
mechanisms whereby outside investors can protect themselves against expropriation by 
insiders. Corporate governance can impact on the risks that outside investors may face in 
respect of any expropriation of assets. These factors together with the size and other 
market frictions may warrant an adjustment to the cash flow expectations and/or an

increment to the cost of capital for the forest if investors’ property rights are not clearly 
defined.  Where control is not obtained a minority discount and / or illiquidity discount 
many apply. 63 
 


Dr. Marsden calculates the real pre-corporate tax WACC range of between 7.1% to 12.8%.  
Poyry then selected the current 8.5% to 9.0% discount rates in New Zeeland and adds a 2.5% to 
3.0% resulting in a discount rate of 11.5%, providing for the 2006 pre-tax cash flow valuation of 
TRE’s assets at $2,297.5 million USD as of December 31, 2010.64  But, Dr. Marsden closes with 
a note and a warning: 


If significant corporate governance and agency cost issues between insides and outside 
investors arise (e.g. from lack of transparency, possible risk of expropriation of assets, 
restrictions of remittance of profits, or exchange rate control), the use of cost of capital at 
the upper end of our range may be warranted.65 


It begs the question; if evidence of systemic and comprehensive fraud and illegal activity is 
discovered in the Company from inception, throughout its operating history, and into the present, 
by how much would the discount rate need to be adjusted?

VIII. Egregiously Complex and Opaque Offshore Structure 





In TRE’s 2010 annual information form, it discloses that it has at least 20 British Virgin Island (“BVI”) entities.  As a recent South China Morning 
Post article points out, BVI is the favorite domicile of Chinese seeking opacity.  There is no public shareholder registry, and there are no 
requirements to file tax returns.  TRE no longer discloses its organizational chart, but the last one it made available in an annual information 
statement is from 2007 – see below.  This structure is highly opaque, and in our view, unnecessary for legitimate business purposes.  It is not a tax-
optimized structure either due to direct ownership of PRC entities by BVI subsidiaries.  (Dividends remitted to Hong Kong holding companies are 
taxed at a lower rate than dividends to BVI owners.)  We therefore pose the following question to TRE’s management (given its emphasis on its 
transparency): “Why have you structured the business in this way?”
Page 34 of 39!


IX. Suspicious Bank Document 





Suspicious Bank Document. 


The following bank letter appears to be written on behalf of Sino-Wood Partners, Ltd.  We found 
it in incorporation applications in the SAIC files for four of Mandra’s entities.  TRE, which now 
owns 100% of Mandra, was a founding shareholder of Mandra with a 15% stake.  Sino-Wood 
was the entity that was reverse merged into the public shell to make TRE a public company.  It 
had been expected to IPO in 2003, but the IPO was unexpectedly canceled.
Page 35 of 39!
Page 36 of 39!


X. Shoddy Corporate Governance 


Internally, TREs fraud was enabled by poor corporate governance.  The corporate governance 
issues include the following: 


• TRE’s board appears to be the retirement plan for partners of its auditor, Ernst & Young.  
It currently has five directors on its board from E&Y.  We believe that such a clubby 
atmosphere can dull the auditors’ ability to perceive problems.  


• We are bothered by senior management’s practice of paying its salary via fees to a 
consulting firm – this is inappropriate for a public company with a multi-billion dollar 
market capitalization.  More disturbing is senior management’s C$12 million buyout of 
its own shares in subsidiary with investor funds.  (The subsidiary’s planned 2003 IPO 
was unexpectedly canceled.) 


• TRE failed to disclose a 2003 petition to wind it up at the listed company level. 
• TRE has failed its internal control test.  The 2010 failure is due to senior management 


personally handling settlement of accounts receivable and accounts payable.  This is 
particularly troublesome because the notes to TRE’s financial statements appear to state 
that the majority of TRE’s receivables from its accounts receivable are paid by TRE’s 
AIs to TREs agents to pay off timber purchases.  If our reading is accurate, then a 
substantial portion of TRE’s purported revenue would not even be expected to hit its 
bank account, thereby making the fraud substantially easier to carry out. 


XI. Glimpses of How TRE Steals the Money 


• From reviewing TRE and the “Agent’s’” annual inspection and audit reports from the 
SAIC files, it seems that the agents mainly serve as a tunnel to move money for TRE.  


• These agents generally report little to no revenue or profit, and pay little to no tax.  
However, they have balance sheets orders of magnitude the sizes of their revenues.  The 
balance sheets mainly consist of receivables from TRE entities, and disturbingly, 
payables to TRE entities.   


• Both Yunnan and Guangxi agents are sending a large amount of money to TRE’s 
undisclosed subsidiary, Huaihua City Yuda Wood Co. Ltd.  This subsidiary is based in 
Huaihua City, Hunan Province, which we suspect is the nerve center for TRE’s illicit 
activities.  We tried mightily to obtain SAIC files for TRE’s four subsidiaries and the 
Hunan agent, but we were only able to obtain minimal information (such as 
shareholdings) after much effort.  This is highly unusual. 


• Payments to farmers and collectives for forest are noticeably scarce in the financial 
statements of the agents.

From the above table, Bohu has made three prepayments to TRE’s subsidiaries totaling RMB 105 
million.  This flow of funds contradicts the disclosed nature of the parties’ relationship.  Further, 
with such low registered capital and poor operating results, it is difficult to understand how 
Bohu’s balance sheet is this large.
Page 38 of 39!


Bohu has an account payable of RMB 327.8 million to six companies.  Four of the six companies 
are Sino-Panel Subsidiaries.  The fifth company Huaihua Yuda is an undisclosed TRE subsidiary 
that has been receiving massive amounts of money from TRE’s subsidiaries.  The last company 
listed is Guangxi Bobai Forestry, which is supposed to be a partner forestry company in Guangxi; 
however, but the amount owed RMB 2.09 ($0.30) pales in comparison.   


Jiangxi Zhonggan (an undisclosed related party) plays the same games.  Its 2009 audit report 
shows that it had received a prepayment of RMB 448.6 million from Sino Panel China 
(Investment) Company Ltd.  In the same year, it made a prepayment of RMB 212.0 million to 
Harbin Oubangde Economic and Trading Co. Ltd., a trading company in Harbin, whose business 
has nothing to do with acquiring forests in Jiangxi Province.   According to the audit report, 
Jiangxi Zhonggang has dealt with more trading companies than forestry companies.  (Appendix 
K3 and K4) 


The same is true for Gengma Forestry (a mostly legitimate agent).  Its revenue has been declining 
since it entered into the master agreement with TRE.  The revenue was RMB 3.6 million in 2007, 
and declined to RMB 160,000 RMB in 2008 and RMB 455,400 in 2009.  The assets and debts are 
787 times 2008 revenue, and 266 times 2009 revenue.  Although it really does broker forests, it 
appears to be helping TRE in some way beside acquiring forest. 


TRE has a significant undisclosed subsidiary, Huaihua Yuda Wood Company Ltd. (怀化裕 木
业有限公司).  Huaihua Yuda has taken massive amount from TRE’s subsidiaries, but its 
existence was never disclosed.  In 2007, Huaihua Yuda received a prepayment of RMB 92.0 
million from Sino Panel (Hezhou) and another payment of RMB 81.0 million from Sino Panel 
(Gengma). (Appendix K5 and K6)  According to our research from two government websites, 
Huaihua Yuda is a subsidiary of TRE.  


XII. The Multi-Billion Dollar Ponzi Scheme 


Sino Forest to date has raised over $3.05 billion from the capital markets and has not paid a cent 
back from free cash  flow, nor has it paid a dividend.  


Sino-Forest raises capital in increasingly larger amounts, which is effectively a Ponzi scheme.  
TRE raises cash from the financial markets, purportedly buys forestry assets, which are then 
valued at a significantly higher level by Poyry (which takes TRE’s word on the size and scope of 
the acquisition at face value), leading to a higher reported net asset value which acts as the 
support or collateral for an even larger capital raise.  The first investor relies upon the new capital 
to generate the return, thereby fitting a classic Ponzi scheme definition. 


It is a fairly standard capital markets transaction to complete a new financing of an asset that has 
increased in value. In isolation, this conceptually would not be a Ponzi scheme. However, a series 
of financings almost wholly reliant upon a series of unreliable reports covering the asset values of 
a company that has been free cash flow negative for 16 straight years should raise some red flags.  
In order to understand how this cycle has managed to continue for such a long period of time, it is 
important to understand two key issues: the manipulation of Jakko Poyry’s valuation reports, and 
the way the TRE uses these reports to convince new investors to finance them.  


With the exception of an incentive payment of $30 million to exchange an existing bond into a 
longer dated one, TRE has never returned any capital to shareholders despite so many financings.  
Because of the nature of the company, TRE must continue to spend in order to survive.  Without

an acquisition pipeline, TRE cannot justify raising capital from new investors.  Without new 
investors, it cannot repay old investors, and would fall apart.  


As expected, TRE is still talking about a large acquisition pipeline for 2011.
