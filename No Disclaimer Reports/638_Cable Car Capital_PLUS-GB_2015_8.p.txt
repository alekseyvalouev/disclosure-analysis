http://www.cablecarcapital.com/your-capital-at-risk-part-8/ 2/6


There are numerous examples of users discussing their experiences with Plus500 online. One trader
complained that his account was frozen for ‘scalping’ after he generated profitable trading activity in
February 2015. Scalping is referenced in section 24.1.3 of the user agreement, but it is not clearly
defined. Even though most Plus500 trades have a duration measured in minutes, according to the
company’s own data, the user agreement contains the clause “a significant number of transactions
with short duration may be deemed as Market Abuse” giving the company wide latitude to reject any
profitable trading activity.


I have no way to assess the merits of individual claims, but making it more difficult to withdraw funds
when customers are profitable would be broadly consistent with a business model designed to
ultimately separate customers from their deposits.


As a concrete example of Plus500 operating outside of legal bounds, consider one such complaint by
a customer in Singapore. I contacted the individual in question and learned only that he eventually
received “his money back” after a delay of several months. I will update this post if I learn more about
his experience. However, what is more remarkable is that Plus500 was operating in Singapore in the
first place. The domain www.plus500.sg redirects to Plus500.com. Yet Singapore has very clear
prohibitions against bucket shops.under the Commodity Trading Act (see note 14). It should be
uncontroversial that operating a bucket shop in Singapore is illegal.


Separately, it may be worth examining the transaction record posted by the customer. I’ve uploaded a
version so there’s no need to register on the Forex Peace Army website. To my eyes, the BTC trades
look like very fortunate trading during a period of extremely high volatility in the underlying instrument.
Perhaps Plus500′s software was slow to catch up to market developments. The nice thing about
Bitcoin is that there is a blockchain transaction record that covers every transaction on every major
BTC exchange. It should be possible to compare the customer’s transactions to the historical record
and draw your own conclusions, if desired.

Pretty scary trades. 


Looks like a student who starts off dabbling with S$600 trades and ends up playing with


S$150,000 tickets. 


What could go wrong?

Not much, really. Plus500 guarantees nobody would loose more than the entire


deposit. But the probability therefore is 90%!!! Seeing Plus500 allows such high


leverages, manipulates trades and charge double-spread at opening a position (and not only half, and the


other half at closing), most customers seem to have a zero account balance after very few trades. Often


already after the first one – that’s how Plus500 defrauds the customers completely.
