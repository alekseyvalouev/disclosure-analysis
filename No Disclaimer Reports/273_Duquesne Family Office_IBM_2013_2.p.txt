The high-profile founder of a hedge fund boasting a 30-year history of success said
he’s shorting IBM (IBM) shares in a bet against the company’s ability to transition
its offerings to cloud-based technology.


According to a Bloomberg account, Stan Druckenmiller, Duquesne Family Office
chairman and chief executive and Duquesne Capital Management founder,
speaking at the inaugural Robin Hood Investors Conference in New York on Nov.
22, called IBM “old technology being replaced by cloud technology.”


He described his bet against IBM’s stock as “one of the more higher-probability
shorts I have seen in years.”


Does Druckenmiller have a point? Is the cloud a serious problem for IBM?


Including its most recent Q3 2013 performance, under chief executive Ginni
Rometty IBM has posted six straight quarters of negative revenue growth and
seven straight quarters in which the company has missed Wall Street’s revenue
expectations.

The fundamentals behind the vendor’s nearly two-year slide—a clunky shift from
Unix to Linux and cloud computing—seems to have convinced Druckenmiller that
IBM’s an IT dinosaur.


Indeed, the numbers may back him up—cloud computing sure seems to be
squeezing the vendor’s hardware business. The most recent evidence is clear: In Q3
2013, IBM’s systems revenue fell 19 percent, with its Power line falling 38 percent,
System x sliding 18 percent and storage falling 11 percent. Among its hardware
platforms, only System z mainframe server products showed some life, with a 6
percent uptick.


But the hardware sales dropoff isn’t IBM’s only problem. While the vendor is
trimming expenses as hardware revenue declines—laying off and furloughing

employees—cloud service providers such as Amazon (AMZN) Web Services and
Google (GOOG) are hiring.


And its cloud revenue figures may be not quite as sturdy as the vendor suggests. In
Q3 IBM pointed to about $1 billion in cloud revenue, but only half of that emanated
from cloud services, with the remainder coming from hardware and software sales.
Because IBM doesn’t specifically break out cloud revenue, it’s difficult to tell how
the company is doing there. Indeed, the SEC began an investigation in May into
how IBM reports cloud computing revenue.


Expert Says Bet on Amazon and Google, Not on IBM


In contrast to IBM, Druckenmiller heaped praise on Amazon and its chief executive
Jeff Bezos and Google, drawing particularly attention to the latter’s technology
development.


Amazon’s Web Services division “is killing it,” Druckenmiller said, according to the
Bloomberg account, as he urged IBM to take on the “challenge of the Amazons of
the world.” In calling Google the most “innovative company on the planet,”
Druckenmiller said investors betting on innovation should side with Google while
those betting against innovation should buy IBM shares.


Druckenmiller closed his hedge fund in 2010 after a 24-year run and now manages
his own wealth through his Duquesne Family Office. He produced average annual
returns of 30 percent at the hedge fund, according to Bloomberg.

Years ago, Chris Day saw a problem in his managed service provider business, Fully
Managed. His techs were spending too much time trying to collect the
documentation they needed to service customers and keep client accounts up-to-
date in his professional services automation (PSA) platform. He looked around for
a product that would offer a multi-tenant solution for IT documentation, and
couldn’t find one. So he decided to build it himself.

The platform streamlined his MSP operations and help desk service processes
exactly as he’d hoped it would, and it wasn’t long before he realized his wasn’t the
only MSP that would benefit from such a solution. He decided to spin it off into its
own product within its own company. Five years ago, IT Glue was born.

From the get-go, Day understood that Fully Managed competitors were the sales
targets for IT Glue. He needed to establish trust with other MSPs he hoped would
buy the product, so he quickly formed a partner advisory council and built out the
platform according to the feedback IT Glue received in conversations with channel
partners. Today, IT Glue has a Slack channel for customers to chat through and a
public idea forum where users can submit ideas, ask about features and vote on
product developments. Five years after its founding, IT Glue is used by more than
60,000 customers, and its popularity is pushing other MSP-management software
providers to either up their IT documentation game or integrate IT Glue into its
own solutions — a critical ask from customers.

“The features for ConnectWise as far as storing procedural documentation, so your
step-by-steps, your how-tos, it's just not where we needed it to be,” says Lane.
“Now there may have been some changes in the last couple years that I can't speak

Lane explains that ConnectWise and other PSA platforms offer modules like the
ability to store procedural documentation or provide granular permissions for
assets, but those capabilities just weren’t where Lane needed them to be. He
couldn’t store a password for a server, for instance, and lock it down by specific
groups or individual users the way he needed to.


In all the talk these days around things like threat detection and response or
cognitive security prediction capabilities, we don’t hear a lot about password
management. It isn’t a sexy topic, and password managers have been around for
well over a decade. Despite this, we hear instance after instance of users’ lax
behavior resulting in bad actors gaining access to ridiculously easy passwords, and
thus the entire network.


“A lot of the big conversation is around just trying so hard to educate users and
protected users from themselves, so to speak,” says Luis Giraldo, vice president of
product at IT Glue. “You can implement all of the technology in the world that you
want but if they keep clicking on that link, or to It Glue’s point, if they keep using
the same terrible passwords over and over again, none of it's really going to
matter.”


Security issues aside, password management is a time-consuming headache for
technicians. Users forget their passwords or lock themselves out after trying too
many times to enter login credentials. Forrester Research estimates that the
average help desk labor cost for a single password reset is about $70. If you take
away the need to reset those passwords constantly, says Giraldo, you can reduce
the number of help desk tickets significantly and free tier one techs up to

generating profit through projects or additional sales efforts.


It seems like a simple thing, but IT Glue’s partner community began asking for a
solution to help them manage passwords. There were already solutions that would
somewhat fit their customers’ needs, but MSPs needed a multi-tiered product that
could store all of their documentation in one place, not to mention sell as a
separate product to clients. IT Glue decided to address the problem with its own
password management offering, My Glue.


IT Glue and My Glue both are designed for one reason: to increase efficiencies.
MSPs are managing more customers, more data and more software platforms than
ever — and trying to do it with the same size staff. And if partners could make a
little on the backend through My Glue resales, all the better.


“It’s a product that's filling a gap that needed to be filled, and it’s a new SKU we can
put on our agreements,” said Lane. “It’s a great opportunity for us to go out, show
them this product, show them how affordable it is, how easy it is to work with, and
how if they desire, it could integrate directly with us as their IT provider as well for
sharing information and documentation.”


In other words, it’s priced low enough that D-Tech can sell it to their customer’s
customers and leverage it as a sales tool for the more comprehensive IT Glue
platform.


And, says Lane, IT Glue and My Glue is designed to provide a user experience (UX)
that makes it easy to search for data, which further helps with efficiency in terms of
reducing on boarding time. It can easily take three to six months to onboard a
junior level technician who’s suddenly tasked with managing 50 clients and 2,000
endpoints. Anything an MSP can do to make the UX easy to navigate is a plus. With
its quick search bar, mobile app and Chrome extensions, it’s easier for new users to
acclimate to the platform in order to start meeting service level goals.


Password management might not be as sexy as other security tools on the market
