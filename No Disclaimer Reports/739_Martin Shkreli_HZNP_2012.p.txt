Debt Burden Makes Horizon Pharma An Attractive Short

Horizon Pharma (NASDAQ:HZNP) is on investors' radars, as the company launched
DUEXIS in January 2012 and has an upcoming PDUFA date of July 26 for its second
product, RAYOS, a modified-release low dose prednisone. The stock has enjoyed a
~100% run-up in its share price during the month of June on little news. Horizon has
33.7MM shares outstanding, cash of $80.4MM, debt of $60MM, and at a share price of
$7.38, an enterprise value of $228MM. DUEXIS is a single-tablet combination of two
generic products, ibuprofen and famotidine, that was fully launched in January 2012 with
80 sales reps. The DUEXIS launch has been slow, with only $0.9MM in sales in the first
quarter of 2012. Accompanying these sales, was an SG&A expense of $16.2MM and a
first quarter net loss of $23.7MM. In the first quarter of 2012, Horizon burned through
$19MM in cash, which is substantially more than total revenue of $2.5MM, and unless
sales ramp substantially, the company may be in trouble, as I will detail in this article.


Unprofitable BioPharma Companies With Large Amounts of Debt Typically Do Not
Perform Well


Importantly, Horizon completed a $50.8MM private placement in March 2012 and entered
into a $60MM senior secured loan in February, netting a total of $81.6MM after paying off
$22.4MM of the previous Oxford and Kreos loans. I am particularly concerned with this
new debt, which I will discuss in greater detail. I do not believe many shareholders are
aware of the risk to equity associated with this debt.


Historically, unprofitable biopharmaceutical stocks with a considerable debt burden do not
perform well. For example, MannKind (NASDAQ:MNKD) is currently trading at a market
cap of $421MM, has an enterprise value of $822M, has a whopping $494MM in debt
($283.5MM from The Mann Group and $211 worth of notes due 2013 and 2015), and no
revenue in 2012. Furthermore, as of 1Q12, MannKind had cash of $56MM, burned
through $33MM in cash, and had a net loss of $38MM in 1Q12. At this rate, ManKind will
be out of money by the end of this quarter. The stock is currently down greater than 75%
since the accumulation of the debt. Most recently, MannKind completed a debt offering of
$100MM aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior convertible notes, which are due
2015.

Dendreon (NASDAQ:DNDN), which burned through $59MM in cash in 1Q12 and had a
net loss of $104MM, also has $574MM of debt on the balance sheet and over the past
year the stock has plummeted 85%, from a high of $39.53 to just over $6. Another
example is Savient (NASDAQ:SVNT), which burned $32MM in cash in 1Q12, recorded
1Q12 revenue of $3.5MM, and had a 1Q12 net loss of $34MM. Savient acquired $177MM
of debt on February 4, 2011. Since the issuance of Savient's debt, the company's stock
tanked almost 95%. These facts are hard to ignore. Horizon shareholders should heed the
lessons learned from these experiences - if company product revenues don't grow
sufficiently to repay the debt, then equity value is often wiped out when the creditors take
control.


Horizon's $60MM Loan Agreement Includes Many Worrisome Covenants


Horizon's debt may cause Horizon's shareholders to lose, big time. First, the debt accrues
interest at 17% annually, resulting in quarterly loan payments of $4.5MM. When one adds
the $4.5MM to the $19MM in cash the company burned in 1Q12, the quarterly burn rate
increases to $23.5MM, all else equal. With $80.4MM in cash at the end of the first quarter,
the company does not have enough cash to last more than three quarters at this burn
rate, or through 1Q13. To make the situation even worse, the debt holders have the option
to ask for an additional quarterly $4MM payment of the loan principal starting April 2013.
Unless sales of DUEXIS and RAYOS ramp significantly, the substantial burn will likely
force the company to seek additional capital, if expenses are unchanged. As I will point
out, I don't expect sales to ramp fast enough, however.


The most important covenants of Horizon's debt can be found in the fine print located in
the company's latest quarterly SEC filing. The most disconcerting debt covenant, that
investors should be aware of, requires that Horizon Pharma meet minimum trailing twelve
month (TTM) revenues, as assessed on a quarterly basis (see Figure 1 below). Note that
this covenant also includes "deferred revenue," which is typically inventory sales. This is
typically an additional 2 months worth of revenue.

As one can see from the Figure 1, for the June 30 quarter, Horizon must meet a TTM
revenue threshold of $10MM. I estimate that for this quarter, the total TTM revenue barely
passed the minimum at $11.5MM. I calculated this number by adding the total revenue for
the past 3 months, estimating $3.5MM in revenue for 2Q12, and accounting for two
months in deferred revenue. Of course, we will know the exact number when the company
reports second quarter earnings. I am most concerned, however, about the September 30
threshold of $20MM. I do not believe that Horizon will be able to meet this minimum
revenue threshold and therefore be in default of the debt.

Potential RAYOS/LODOTRA Sales Are Expected to Have Minimal Impact on
Horizon's Ability to Meet TTM Revenue Thresholds


If approved on the July 26 PDUFA, Horizon's RAYOS (A.K.A. LODOTRA, marketed in the
EU) is expected to be launched by the fourth quarter. Hence, I don't expect it to have
much of an impact on Horizon's ability to meet the September 30 $20MM revenue
requirement. Even if RAYOS is approved, I expect its sales to have minimal impact on the
company's top line, as it has had a disappointing performance in the EU. The EU
performance may be a good proxy for how it will do in the U.S. During 2009, 2010, and
2011, LODOTRA achieved sales of $6.6MM, $6.8MM, and $16.5MM, respectively.


DUEXIS Launch is Tracking Poorly and Not Generating Enough Revenue to Meet
Debt Covenant Thresholds

Additionally, Horizon's newly launched DUEXIS has had a fairly anemic launch to date and
is currently tracking at a $7MM annual run-rate. This launch is tracking almost identically
to Somaxon's (NASDAQ:SOMX) SILENOR, which peaked at a $10MM run-rate. Based
upon the current drug launch trajectory of DUEXIS and the LODOTRA's EU experience, I
estimate that Horizon will record $15.8MM in total TTM revenue (3Q12 revenue estimate =
$4MM) by the end of 3Q12. According to my calculation, Horizon will not meet the $20MM
revenue threshold and subsequently trip the $60MM debt covenant.


Keep in mind that even if Horizon does somehow meet the September 30 threshold, the
minimum revenue requirement increases by $10MM each consecutive quarter. The bar
increases rapidly. Even if the DUEXIS launch mirrored VIMOVO's launch by
AstraZeneca's (NYSE:AZN), Horizon would still fail to meet the revenue thresholds.
Ultimately, I believe that DUEXIS, which is tracking poorly, and RAYOS, if approved, will
need to wildly surpass expectations if Horizon is to meet the revenue thresholds of the
debt.


Somaxon is a relatively good proxy for Horizon, in my opinion. Horizon's DUEXIS sales
trajectory is comparable to Somaxon's SILENOR. Note that on August 25, 2010, Somaxon
announced a co-promotion agreement with Proctor & Gamble. Since then, Somaxon
shares are down over 90%. Similarly, Horizon entered into a DUEXIS co-promotion
agreement with Mallinckrodt on June 18, 2011, and if the stock performs similarly to
Somaxon's following the announcement, expect shareholders to lose.


Generic Paragraph IV Filings Have Begun for DUEXIS


Another factor that may impact expectation of DUEXIS and RAYOS, if approved, is
possible Paragraph IV filings by generic drug manufacturers. Keep in mind that both
DUEXIS and RAYOS are formulations of generic active drug ingredients, so it is possible
for a generic manufacturer to file a Paragraph IV in anticipation of marketing a generic
form of either drug. Once a Paragraph 4 is filled, the company, or Horizon in this case, has
45 days to sue the generic manufacturers for patent infringement. After the suit is filed, the
FDA has to wait to approve or deny the filing until the generic manufacturer defends the
suit or 30 months, whichever comes first.


In fact, Paragraph IV filings for DUEXIS have already begun. At the end of March, just two
months after the DUEXIS launch, Horizon filed a patent infringement lawsuit in the United
States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking to block Par Pharmaceutical Inc.
from marketing a generic version of DUEXIS. AstraZeneca's (AZN) VIMOVO, as
discussed above, is another drug that has been plagued by a slew of Paragraph IV filings.
