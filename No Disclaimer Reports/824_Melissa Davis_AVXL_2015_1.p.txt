Anavex: A Regulatory Target Damaged By Incriminating Evidence
Dec. 30, 2015 8:08 AM ET350 comments
by: Melissa Davis


Summary


Following a powerful rally fueled by overblown hype, Anavex just disclosed that the
SEC has launched a formal investigation of the company to search for evidence of
possible stock manipulation.


Suspicious from the start, Anavex looks almost like a reincarnated version of a
worthless biotechnology firm with disturbing ties to a pair of notorious con artists.


Over the years, Anavex has recruited a number of insiders linked to dubious
microcap companies and shady stock promoters.


Since its early days as a young penny-stock company, Anavex has outsourced its
investor relations duties to a tarnished publicity firm connected to a number of
suspected “pump-and-dump” schemes.


Anavex owes some of its current popularity to the glowing reviews published by a
so-called “doctor” who served as the chairman of a firm that charges for its favorable
coverage.


Anavex (NASDAQ: AVXL) should have known that the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission would eventually crack down on the company. A virtual magnet for stock
promoters from the very beginning, Anavex started tempting fate long before the SEC
decided to intervene.


Just wait until those regulators get a chance to conduct a thorough background check on
the company and its disturbing history. They might wonder how Anavex ever managed to
transform itself from an obscure penny stock into an overhyped Nasdaq highflier without
first attracting some pretty intense government scrutiny.


At this point, Anavex has literally spent years asking for trouble.

Anavex Co-Founder/Director Tom Skarpelos must have felt pretty impressed with
Acrongenomics (OTC: OTC:AGNM) when he oversaw investor relations for the young
microcap company - regardless ofthe crook who initially presided over its executive suite -
since he practically used that dubious (and now worthless) biotechnology firm as a role
model when he decided to create one of his own.


Retracing the steps taken by those who had launched Acrongenomics a few years earlier,
Skarpelos gained control of a Nevada-based shell with a handy listing on the OTC Bulletin
Board and then used it in a reverse merger that allowed Anavex to debut as a brand-new
biotechnology firm trading on the penny-stock exchange. Like Acrongenomics itself,
Anavex entered the world armed with little more than a handful of discarded European
patents- conveniently supplied, in this case, by a French doctor that Acgrongenomics had
recruited to its board - and farfetched plans to show up Big Pharma by delivering a
medical breakthrough.


Eager to take full advantage of the former Acrongenomics director who had provided the
company with its "new" patents - including the one issued for its lead drug candidate way
back in 1997 and now set to expire the year after next - Anavex also named Dr. Alexandre
Vamvakides as its chief scientific officer and copied Agrongenics (yet again) by welcoming
him as a member of its board.


Anavex quickly snatched up a technology specialist with a very interesting connection to
Acrongenomics, too. Officially hired by Anavex as its original I.T. manager, Stelios
Xeroudakis also happened to manage the website for the mysterious laboratory that
supposedly housed the groundbreaking research conducted by Acrongenomics and
(years later) its dependable copycat. When Anavex negotiated its own contract with Euro
Genet Labs in 2010, more than a full year before it even secured approval to begin any
clinical trials, the company must have felt awfully generous. Under the terms of that three-
year deal, Anavex agreed to shell out a whopping $125,000 a month - or the equivalent of
$1.5 million annually - for access to research facilities located inside some obscure
laboratory with the same Greek address that both Acrongenomics and the company itself
have claimed as their own.


At least Anavex spared itself from the embarrassment of welcoming former
Acrongenomics CEO Rick Walchuk to the party, too, byreserving that invitation for another
longtime player in the microcap arena instead. The year after Anavex surfaced as a new
biotech stock, Walchuk finally managed to push his luck just a little bit too far. Together

with Caroline Winsor - an indicted fugitive long regarded as a serial penny-stock
manipulator - Walchuk attempted to pull off a new pump-and-dump scheme and fell right
into a government trap.


Later indicted on multiple charges of wire and securities fraud, Walchuk responded by
fleeing to his native Greece (the same country that the founder of Anavex happens to call
home), where a financial crime squad arrested him a couple of years ago and - after
locking him up in a filthy Greek prison for a few months - shipped him back to the U.S. for
another year behind bars.


Anavex did not respond to questions for this story.


Bad News


While Anavex may have avoided a direct connection to that particular mess, the company
has taken plenty of other chances that it could easily live to regret. Since its early days as
a young penny-stock company, for example, Anavex has relied on The Primoris Group for
publicity in spite of the firm's crowded roster of dubious microcap companies and its
suspected involvement in pump-and-dump schemes.


By the time that Anavex hired the firm almost a decade ago - using 50,000 stock options
to help cover the bill - Primoris had already developed a reputation for touting the very sort
of sleazy microcap stocks responsible for giving the industry such a horrible name. Just a
few years earlier, records show, Primoris had actually joined forces with a group of shady
promoters to trumpet worthless HiEnergy, a heavily manipulated penny stock secretly
controlled by a convicted felon best known for his role in "The Mob on Wall Street."


Still pumping HiEnergy even with its suspected ties to the Mob already exposed, the head
of StockHouse - a promotional website that had named Primoris President Joseph
Carusone as its executive vice president of operations and Primoris Director Christos
Livadasas the president of its U.S. division - boldly predicted that the worthless stock
could explode into a triple-digit highflier with Primoris in charge of its publicity.


"I would expect HiEnergy to get a fair share of media attention,"StockHouse Founding
CEO Jeff Berwick declared after the company hired Primoris to orchastrate a major
publicity campaign. "I am familiar with the group they're using for their PR, and they are
very, very good at getting attention for companies like HiEnergy."


A total fraud in this particular case, HiEnergy soon attracted plenty of attention, all right --
from government authorities who cracked down on the company and those suspected of
using its stock as a vehicle for a blatant pump-and-dump scheme.

Bitter Pill


With Primoris in charge of its publicity, Anavex has managed to generate some rather
powerful hype of its own.


Anavex owes at least some of its newfound popularity to THE GLOWING REVIEWS
published by Kanak Kanti De, a so-called "doctor" who has developed a strong following
on financial websites like Seeking Alpha and The Motley Fool (where he ranks as a senior
healthcare contributor) by portraying himself as "a retired medical practitioner" with an
impressive "M.D." behind his name. Unless De rushed to pursue a second career in
medicine after serving as the chairman of IndoGenic Consultancy - a paid content provider
that caters to clients seeking favorable stock coverage - however, his credentials look
somewhat inflated, to say the very least. In the official bio that appeared on its website
less than five years ago, IndoGenic described De as "a veteran college principal (retired)
with a Ph.D. in English" - not a medical doctor - when the firm openly showcased his role
as the chairman of its board. [Editor's note: Kanak Kanti De's response can be seen
here.]


Not that Anavex has ever seemed overly worried about hanging out with the wrong sort of
crowd. If Anavex cared about its image, the company should have never even hired an
investor relations firm like Primoris - especially after it chose to appoint a director with
such a terrible track record -- in the first place.


Already blamed for some pretty major stock blowups before Primoris and StockWatch
eagerly welcomed him aboard, Livadas had originally "made a name for himself" by
publishing an Internet-based tout sheet that pumped all sorts of horrible penny stocks
headed for ruin.


Former Anavex CEO Harvey Lalach ought to know. By the time that he officially took over
as head of corporate communications for heavily promoted Goldtex Resources - just one
of many dubious microcap firms where he served as an officer and/or director before co-
founding Anavex and running the company for most of its life - Livadas had already spent
months relentlessly touting that worthless mining company in a campaign that would
ultimately leave bag-holders with some pretty deep scars.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3782676-anavex-regulatory-target-damaged-incriminating-evidence 5/75


"Mr. Livadas is best known for blowing up dozens of investors via his now-defunct
Internet newsletter known as the 'Central Investment Agency,'" one investor warned
years after Goldtex collapsed. "Dozens of mostly mining and oil/gas juniors were
highly touted, and prices were driven to high levels as a result of manipulation and
very thin public floats. In every case, they ended up in the recycle bin or trading for a
few pennies.


"Among the more high-profile names were Goldtex Resources (GXR.Alberta),
promoted to $14 in '96 - even though it had no producing properties - now renamed
Cantex Mining and trading at $0.16; Erin Ventures (EV.Alberta), $5 in '97 to a current
$0.12; and Everest Mining, which peaked at $3.50 and now trades on the VSE
(Vancouver Stock Exchange) at $0.04" a share.


Two of those stocks have continued to sink even lower - including the recycled version of
Goldtex, currently hovering around 5 cents a share - and the other one no longer appears
to trade any more at all.


Unhealthy Choices


Free to sail away from that painful mess, Livadas has since gone on to launch a new
yacht company with the help of the former Anavex executive (Xeroudakis) who previously
worked at Acrongenomics and oversaw the website for the obscure laboratory that both of
those companies just happened to choose. Good luck even trying to find that mysterious
lab these days. With the exception of its neglected website - stripped down to nothing
more than a canned image and a leftover logo - Euro Genet Labs has apparently
managed to vanish without a trace.


Anavex has employed a couple of other executives who must like to hang out with big-
name promoters, too. Before they vacated their positions to pursue new opportunities,
regulatory filings show, former Anavex Executive Chairman Cameron Durant and former
CFO David Tousley agreed to double as high-ranking officers at Oncbiomune
Pharmaceutical (OTC: OTCQB:OBMP) when their friend Mr. Carusone - the promoter who
founded Primoris after spending a couple of years in the StockHouse executive suite -
took over as vice president of investor relations at the obscure biotech company.


Even with that pair now gone, Anavex still needs to clean house if it wants the public to
forget about its dirty microcap roots. While Anavex may deserve some credit for replacing
Lalach with current CEO Christopher Missling - even if it hired him away from an
investment banking firm (Brimberg & Co.) that FINRA had just expelled - the company has

since followed up by selecting a CFO saddled with baggage that it conveniently (and
perhaps understandably) forgot to disclose. Prior to assuming her current post a couple of
months ago, her more forthcoming LinkedIn bio shows, Anavex CFO Sandra Boenish
spent two-and-a-half years serving as the vice president of finance at Naked Brand Group
(NASDAQ: OTCQB:NAKD), some obscure underwear company that alsorelied on a
reverse merger with a Nevada-based shell to go public on the penny-stock exchange.


Toxic Financing


Both hyped by paid stock promoters in orchestrated publicity campaigns, Anavex and
Naked Brand share another trait in common, too. Despite the painful consequences
suffered by so many other cash-strapped microcap companies, they elected to sign toxic
financing deals with Lincoln Park Capital shortly after Boenish arrived on the scene.


To be fair, Anavex had already inked a previous deal with LPC that - given the miserable
performance of its stock the following year (not to mention the collapse that Naked illness
had also suffered) - should have taught the company a lesson. Nevertheless, Anavex
decided to strike a new deal with LPC - and throw in a fresh pile of free stock as a
generous reward - even though the firm had apparently rushed to unload most of the
cheap and/or free stock that it had previously received from the bleeding company.


All told, figures in its regulatory filings indicate, Anavex had issued almost 5 million shares
of stock to LPC - with all but 70,000 of those shares already gone - when the company
rewarded the firm with a sweetheart deal that replenished its dwindling stock supply.
Anavex had just sold a big chunk of that stock to LPC over the summer, with the shares
rapidly doubling in price during the brief period when that stock could have changed
hands, so the firm must have already rushed to claim a pretty nice jackpot by the time that
it returned to the company for a fresh handout and a welcome opportunity to strike it rich
all over again.


Desperate Company


Unless Anavex felt awfully desperate, the company should have known better than to
even conduct business with a vulture financing firm that others tend to regard as a last
resort.


Take a typical LPC client like Galena Biopharma (NASDAQ: GALE), for example. Another
biotech stock that seemed to burst out of nowhere to take the market by storm, Galena
sparked so much Internet hype a couple of years ago that it rapidly tripled in price on that

bullish chatter alone. With paid stock promoters allegedly behind much of the so-called
"spam chatter" fueling that rally, however, Galena inevitably tanked once that powerful
hype faded away and stripped the stock of its artificial support.


Faced with a regulatory probe and limited financing options the following year, Galena
turned to LPC for help and - like Anavex itself - settled for the same kind of toxic funding
deal that had already left so many other desperate companies in even worse shape.


"Lincoln Park … has a reputation for financing troubled biotech companies - but at great
cost," veteran biotech reporter Adam Feuerstain cautioned his readers at the time. "What
does Lincoln Park do with the Galena stock it buys from the company at a discount? The
firm resells the stock right back into the market, making a profit on the difference in price
… Over time, existing shareholders of troubled biotech companies tend to be the biggest
losers when Lincoln Park gets involved."


Second Opinion


Around the same time that Anavex sold that mountain of cheap stock to LPC over the
summer, the company happened to win the loyal support of a popular new fan. One of the
most vocal promoters of Anavex by far, the infamous "Dr." De published his first article on
the company back in late July and has continued to trumpet the tiny biotechnology firm in
more than a dozen follow-up reports - including widely read interviews with a couple of
insiders - since that time.


While he released those particular articles on Seeking Alpha, where they reached a broad
audience of investors and attracted hundreds of comments, De also operates a website of
his own. Currently named after the doctor himself, drkkd.com features an IP address(listed
as 108.61.158.138 on IP Tracker) that (according to the Reverse IP Lookup feature)
previously belonged to a site called ContentCruise.com, which listed
indogeniclagal@gmail.com as its email address.


A subsidiary of Indogenic, the paid content provider that appointed De to serve as the
chairman of its board, StockRiters.com offers to develop far more elaborate stock publicity
campaigns. An imaginary figure packaged by the website as a prolific stock expert, "Ed
Liston" actually prepared an article about Anavex for SmallCapNetwork (yet another
promotional site) a few years before the stock started to attract any real attention.


The fictional Liston also shows up as a senior contributing editor at
TheStockMarketWatch.com, a website connected to one of the most recognized names in
the world of penny-stock promotion. The owner of that website (identified as its most

popular), Patriot Publishingrelies on some of the very same promoters that the Beacon
Equity group has claimed as members of its own team.


Stockguru.com, a promotional website founded by former Beacon Director John Pentony,
has touted Anavex so many times that itopenly brags about its "extensive coverage" of the
bleeding biotech company. When questioned by curious/suspicious investors about his
potential motives, Pentony insisted that Stockguru had provided all of that valuable
publicity about Anavex without collecting any sort of fee. He must have felt awfully
generous then, since his other firm (PennyIR.com) normally charges companies seeking
that sort of exposure.


Despite his more reputable appearance, De stopped well short of making the same kind of
reassuring claim. In fact, he has apparently decided to just keep his mouth shut. Asked to
disclose whether he has received any sort of compensation for his bullish coverage of
Anavex, De has so far responded to that simple request (emailed by this reporter more
than a full week ago) with deafening silence.


Believe it or not, after relentlessly gushing about Anavex for months, De may have just
delivered his most convincing message yet without even bothering to utter a word.


Painful Truth


Anavex never managed to fool legitimate biotech experts with more demanding standards.
When Anavex tried to brag about the "impressive" results of its dinky clinical trials, one of
the most seasoned reporters in the biotech arena immediately blasted the company for
trumpeting pointless results in a blatant effort to pump up its stock price.


"Anavex has already demonstrated a commitment to issuing press releases meaningless
to anyone but people day-trading their volatile stock," Adam Feuerstein warned his
followers on TheStreet.com a few weeks ago. "It will take a while, but the Anavex story is
likely to end just as badly as past small-cap Alzheimer stock blow-ups …


"This promotion has nothing to do with science."
