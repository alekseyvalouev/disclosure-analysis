Doubts about the


Independence of LDK’s


Independent Audit


Committee.


This week asensio.com published three reports on LDK Solar


Co., Ltd. (NYSE: LDK) as part of an advocacy project to


demonstrate short-selling’s positive contributions to the


securities industry. Serious questions remain concerning the


Chinese solar company’s reported earnings and dealings


with suppliers. In October, LDK announced that it had


formed an “independent audit committee” to investigate the


company’s expense capitalization and inventory valuation


policies.


Now the “independence” of LDK’s independent audit


committee has been drawn into question. On December 4,


LDK CFO Jack Lai revealed details from the investigation to a


reporter from Dow Jones Newsletters. It appears that a


source from either the independent audit committee,


headed by two supposedly independent directors from


LDK’s board, or from the committee’s independent legal and


accounting experts, provided details from the investigation


to Mr. Lai. Mr. Lai then disclosed this information to Dow


Jones, driving the price of LDK’s stock up 97% in six trading


days.

Increasing concern about the independence of LDK’s


independent audit committee compelled asensio.com’s


former leader, Manuel P. Asensio, to contact Simpson


Thatcher & Bartlett, the law �rm LDK retained to advise the


“independent” committee. The letter inquires about the


independence of the audit committee, copying individuals


from Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, the “Big Four” auditor


Simpson Thatcher retained for this investigation, and LDK’s


auditors, KPMG China. Click here to review this letter and


additional information relating to Mr. Lai’s stock promotion.
