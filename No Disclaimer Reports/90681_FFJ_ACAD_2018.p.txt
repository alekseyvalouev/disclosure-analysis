Acadia Pharmaceuticals: This Is Not a Pharmaceutical
Company

Frequently sporting a $2 billion plus market capitalization, Acadia Pharmaceuticals brings to mind the work of Belgian surrealist Rene
Magritte (https://www.renemagritte.org/rene-magritte-paintings.jsp) . His 1929 painting “The Treachery of Images
(https://collections.lacma.org/node/239578) ” depicts a pipe with the inscription “This is not a pipe,” suggesting that an image and its meaning don’t
necessarily correspond with each other.


In that vein, San Diego–based Acadia portrays itself as a pharmaceutical company but a Southern Investigative Reporting Foundation
investigation has revealed that this is merely a clever facade. What lies below is a ruthless marketing entity whose pursuit of regulatory
approval is best described as “loophole-centric.”

Nonetheless, in little more than two years, Acadia has gained a remarkable foothold in the pharmaceutical marketplace. The company

Dig into Avanir’s quarterly filings, however, and Nuedexta’s waning prospects appear in sharper relief. In the second quarter of 2017, sales
of the drug totaled nearly $64.5 million. But in the first quarter of this year, its sales declined to $49.8 million.

Unlike Avanir, Acadia does not have a deep-pocketed parent to absorb the potentially steep costs should regulators and plaintiff’s lawyers
begin to demand answers.
One area where Acadia has hewed closely to Avanir’s script can be found in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services

Reports uploaded to the FAERS database that indicate a patient died while taking Nuplazid sharply outnumbered the reported deaths of
those on the nine other drugs: A total of 610 individuals died while taking Nuplazid but just 87 died while taking any of the nine other
medications. Nuplazid-tied deaths represented more than 38 percent of the total number of serious incidents; but for those taking any of
the other nine medications, death amounted to less than 5 percent all serious incidents.

These results cannot be interpreted as definitive: Patients taking Nuplazid are usually quite frail since they have had Parkinson’s disease for


several years and might be weaker on average than the people on the nine other drugs. Additionally, newer drugs tend to draw
more FAERS submissions than more established ones.


But these results certainly show Nuplazid has a radically different safety profile than other Parkinson’s disease treatments.


A second chart explores whether Nuplazid’s seemingly high level of adverse event reports is similar to reactions to another central nervous
system-targeted drug,

Calculating the number of deaths as a percentage of the number of adverse events associated with the rate for Namzaric is tricky because
few people who took either drug did so for the same amount of time.


Fortunately medical statisticians can rely on a measurement tool called “patient years. (http://onbiostatistics.blogspot.com/2009/05/understanding-
person-year-or-patient.html) ” It is an average of how many patients have taken a specific drug over the course of a given year. For example,
assume a certain drug costs each patient $10,000 a year to take and that the medication had $100,000,000 in sales. Using the patient years
calculation, researchers could say that roughly 10,000 patients took the drug for one year.


For this chart each drug’s annual sales figure was divided by its retail price at the end of 2016 and 2017: Namzaric cost $4,249 at the end of
2016 — and $5,069 in 2017. For Nuplazid, it was $25,000 and $33,336, respectively. Namzaric’s patient years figures in 2016 and 2017


were 13,536 and 25,805; Nuplazid’s were 692 and 3,747.


“Deaths per patient year” is a rough statistical way of measuring patient deaths while assuming the typical patient used the drug for a full
year. Epidemiologists call this “the excess death rate (https://definedterm.com/a/definition/218013) ,” or the number of deaths above what is
reasonably anticipated in a population group.


The number of patient deaths for Namzaric was a scant .0001; Nuplazid’s tally, however, was .0881 in 2016 and .1033 in 2017.


So in 2016, if 1,000 patients took Nuplazid for one year, about 88, or 8.8 percent, could be expected to die over and above the already steep
mortality rate of approximately 25 percent; in 2017 the figure would rise to 103. But it would take 10,000 patients on a Namzaric protocol
for a full year for a single death to result.


This is the full text (http://sirf-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACAD-SIRF-Response-07-08-18.pdf) of Acadia’s response to the Southern
Investigative Reporting Foundation’s questions (http://sirf-online.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/ACAD_Questions_Feb18.pdf) .


Editor’s note: To obtain the fairest profile of the drug histories, the Southern Investigative reporting Foundation used adverse event
reports of “serious cases,” or incidents that required medical attention, and then deaths were subtracted from this total. For the death
figures, only deaths reported as a prospective reaction to a drug were counted, as opposed to the higher “death cases” figure that the FDA
records.


Correction: An earlier version of this story inaccurately described Nuedexta’s safety profile. It has never carried a black box warning.
Also Avanir Pharmaceuticals has two drugs that are commercially available.
