Illegal Products Could Spell Big Trouble At Lumber Liquidators

Lumber Liquidators (NYSE:LL) is one of the largest specialty retailers of hardwood flooring
in the United States running a total of close to 300 retail stores in 46 states. Its product is
found to contain illegal levels of formaldehyde -a known carcinogen.


Introduction


Lumber Liquidators reported net revenue of $813 million and $47 million in net income for
the year 2012. At $82 a share, the stock trades at around 50x its 2012 earnings. This
stock is the definition of a high flier: trading at over 50x fiscal year 2012 earnings, amazing
for a building material retailer. The rationale for this huge multiple is twofold:


1) Huge gross and net margins, despite selling a commodity product


2) An aggressive growth plan to double the number of retail outlets


At the current level, Lumber Liquidators presents a compelling short opportunity for
investors for reasons beyond its egregious valuation. This report shows that Lumber
Liquidators lacks a proper product quality control system and its products may be
hazardous to the unsuspecting consumers. Given the issues presented, Lumber
Liquidators faces significant risks in executing its business plans. The margin expansion
may reverse when additional quality control processes are put in place. Further, enormous
risks are present for the Company may be required to recall its noncompliant products
sold. Investors in Lumber Liquidators are likely unaware or unfamiliar with the significance
of selling noncompliant composite wood products to consumers. The stock may
experience significant decline if the Company were to be forced to recall its products.
Moreover, sell-side estimate will become unreliable should consumers abandon Lumber
Liquidators for health and safety concerns.


The Company's stock has been on a tear, rallying 300% over the last year, primarily on
dramatic expansion of its gross and net margins. Management has often made reference
to the significance of its acquisition of Sequoia Floorings Inc., based in Shanghai, as a
primary reason for the tremendous improvement in margins. Sourcing product in China is
certainly hardly unknown to competitors, and skeptics have wondered how an $8 million

acquisition could have such a dramatic effect on gross margin and bottom line, and more
importantly, enable Lumber Liquidators to undercut fierce price competitors such as Home
Depot (NYSE:HD) and Lowe's (NYSE:LOW).


That piqued my curiosity, but nothing improper was found about the acquisition of Sequoia
itself. I then directed the investigation towards the quality of flooring sold by Lumber
Liquidators that is imported from China. And that is where we found the problem being
reported today.


While a darling for its investors, Lumber Liquidators is among the lowest rated flooring
retailers according to Resellers Review. Quality issues such as durability abound for
customers who purchased flooring products from Lumber Liquidators. Few, however,
would think their health and well-being are also in danger when they put in flooring
products from Lumber Liquidators. The issue concerns the Company's quality control
process on formaldehyde emission standards when it imports engineered and laminated
wood flooring products from countries such as China. While the Company boasts strict
compliance with CARB Phase II, my research uncovers product sold by the Company to
consumers in the state of California that is in gross violation of the emission standards set
forth by the California Air Resources Board. Such a violation does not only apply in the
state of California. On May 29th, 2013, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
took the first step to implement the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood
Products Act signed into law by President Obama in 2010. Those standards are identical
to the emission standards established by the California Air Resources Board.


Investors in Lumber Liquidators have been riding on a housing boom backed by the
Company's efforts to expand its gross margin through more efficient sourcing initiatives in
China. In 2011, Lumber Liquidators purchased certain assets of Sequoia Flooring Inc. in
China and has since experienced significant margin expansion. Its gross margin improved
from 34.8% in the year 2010 to 40.4% in the first quarter of 2013. Lumber Liquidators
attributes its gross margin expansion to its efficient Chinese sourcing operation. But does
the efficiency come at the cost of product quality and safety?


Background


Lumber Liquidators Holdings, Inc. (Lumber Liquidators) is a retailer of hardwood flooring,
and hardwood flooring enhancements and accessories. The Company offers an
assortment of wood flooring, which includes prefinished domestic and exotic hardwoods,

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1513142-illegal-products-could-spell-big-trouble-at-lumber-liquidators 3/38


engineered hardwoods, unfinished hardwoods, bamboo, cork and laminates, as well as
resilient flooring. Its hardwood flooring products are available in various widths and
lengths. It offers approximately 350 different flooring product stock-keeping units.


Lumber Liquidators has come a long way since the housing bust. Over the past year
alone, LL's stock price almost tripled, boasting a valuation of over $2.4 billion. With the
market blindly investing in all stocks housing related, investors in Lumber Liquidators
ignored critical questions about the true source of the Company's margin expansion.
Among flooring retailers, Lumber Liquidators has a reputation of being able to offer
customers the lowest priced products. According to conversations with the sales
representative at a Lumber Liquidators retail store, the prices offered at Lumber
Liquidators for comparable products are often $1 or more cheaper than those at Home
Depot or Lowe's on a per square footage basis. Despite the ultra-low price it charges
consumers, Lumber Liquidators has managed to achieve a gross margin of over 40% in
the first quarter of 2013. The management's assertion that margin expansion all came
from direct sourcing efforts in China should raise concerns for investors. Is the Company
sacrificing quality to achieve such margins; if so, will the quality issues turn into safety
issues and trip up the Company with the regulators. Further, what kind of brand image
impact may ensue when consumers became aware the flooring products from Lumber
Liquidators may in fact be emitting carcinogenic chemicals beyond the limit mandated by
the government?


Formaldehyde Scare in China


A&W, Anxin Weiguang Flooring, was a leading hardwood flooring company in China until
February of 2012 when a consumer advocate broke the news on the Internet that A&W
branded engineered hardwood flooring products do not meet regulatory formaldehyde
emission standards. For investors who are unfamiliar with formaldehyde, it is listed as a
known carcinogen in June of 2011 by the National Toxicology Program. In addition to
being a known human carcinogen, formaldehyde is also shown to cause childhood
asthma and female reproductive issues. A&W is a major Chinese flooring company
counting Carlyle as one of its investors. Media nicknamed the issue "toxic flooring gate"
and drew an incredible amount of attention from consumers. Among the allegations, the
advocate detailed A&W branded engineered hardwood flooring products used in certain
condominiums developments significantly exceed the regulatory limits and such flooring
products were sourced directly from A&W. The issue turned into a major controversy
forcing China Vanke, the largest residential real estate developer in China, to re-test all
the flooring products sourced from A&W. After comprehensive testing of the flooring

products in question, Vanke identified at least one of its developments where the
formaldehyde emission level of the flooring products was noncompliant. The incident
caused significant public concerns and subsequently, A&W experienced a drastic sales
slump and almost went bankrupt as a result of the incident. In addition to supplying
products to real estate developers in China, companies such as A&W also export flooring
products to the United States. Per relevant regulations, the importers bear the
responsibility of ensuring the safety of their imports. Does Lumber Liquidators have proper
assurance procedures in place to ensure products installed in people's homes in the U.S.
meet the formaldehyde emission standards set forth by relevant regulatory bodies?

Consumer Reviews Spell Troubles


Lumber Liquidators' management has successfully executed its planned store expansion
and growth strategy in addition to the noted gross margin expansion, yet investors also
assumed its future expansion and marketing strategies will be smoothly executed. For the
optimistic investors, universally negative consumer reviews should serve as an alarm bell.


According to 63 reviews posted on the website Reseller Reviews, on a 10-point scale,
Lumber Liquidators scored a miserable 3.61 on pricing and service while another local
reseller scored 9.62. The bull argument so far seems to be that consumer opinions do not
matter; granted, Lumber Liquidators has managed to grow its same-store sales and
achieve significant margin expansion over the past year with all the negativity. The
continuation of its success is hardly guaranteed. When consumers learn they may have
rested on the empty promises of the Company to ensure the environmental safety of their
homes, their reactions could be much more draconic. If the Chinese flooring company,
A&W, were of any guidance, putting consumers' health at risk in exchange for margin
expansion can hardly be a sound business strategy.


As noted before, Lumber Liquidators is no stranger to negative consumer reviews. A
significant number of consumer reviews seem to focus on the observable factors such as
the planks are not the same width across their length or the products are not durable
enough. In a number of consumer reviews, the consumer noted the weird odor they smell
after installing Lumber Liquidators' products in their homes. The majority of U.S.
consumers do not seem to be well-versed in the role of formaldehyde in engineered
flooring products and the significant health risks that come with prolonged excessive

exposure. However, a number of complaints hint at the issue at large. In a note posted on
Complaints Board, Tommy detailed a miserable experience he had with Lumber
Liquidators in 2011:


"We bought 1600sf Bellawood floor from Lumber Liquidators and installed it in our
house. Right after the installation, my family started suffering irritated eyes, skin
rash, and burning throat, respiratory stress. Indoor air testing showed the
formaldehyde level was above 0.2ppm, which is 25 time higher than the normal level
(0.008ppm). We have to move to other place to avoid exposure. The Lumber
Liquidators and their insurance company Liberty Mutual kicked the ball back and
forth, and made us a homeless for 8 months. I would like to tell other customers of
Lumber Liquidators, if you are suffering some respiratory symptoms, check the
Formaldehyde level in your house. If you are going to buy products from Lumber
Liquidator, please think about my experience."


Another note posted by Max77054:


"We installed 16oo sf bella wood floor in my house in 2009. Right after the
installation, all of my family members started to have allergic reactions, headache,
dry eyes, burning throat, skin rash, etc. We did indoor air pollution analysis, and
found a high concentration of formaldehyde (25 times higher than it should be) in my
house. Wood floor material analysis found it contains a large amount of
formaldehyde in the top finish of the bellawood floor. Please contact me if you have
the same experience. 713-829-2172."


While most consumers did not bother to understand what the weird smell is, others went
the extra step to test the indoor Formaldehyde level after installing Lumber Liquidators
products. They certainly are not alone when it comes to having formaldehyde issues with
Lumber Liquidators' products. In another note posted on Floormasters.com, a site
dedicated for wood flooring professionals, one installer expressed his concerns regarding
Lumber Liquidators' product quality:

"Just bid 800 sqft install. Customer found some Strand Bamboo at LL and loves the
color and grain. I'm hesitant to install any Strand Bamboo for several reasons:
Dimpling where there are cleats, instability, cracking tongues, and the finish is very
sensitive to moisture. Obviously the price of $3.60/ sqft is appealing to the customer,
but I've read many reviews stating that LL uses a specific type of Formaldehyde that
gases off and causes odor issues and medical issues if you have a sensitivity to it. I
think that I will be able to persuade them into a exotic that will be happy with, but
with a new LL in town, I think this will become more frequent. I have installed a
couple Bellawood floors and thought they were ok, not great, but with such a lack of
quality control, I am seriously considering not installing any LL products. I always try
to educate the customers, but price can be a difficult obstacle to overcome. How do
you all approach customers when LL is considered? Have many of you installed
their Strand Bamboo before?"


The flooring professional noted "many reviews" stating Lumber Liquidators products cause
odor issues and medical issues. With a significant price discount to its peers, Lumber
Liquidators understandably may appeal to certain consumers who care less about
durability or overall quality of their flooring, but they certainly did not sign up to purchase
products that will emit excessive level of a known carcinogenic toxic chemical for many
years to come. The substantial health risks associated with prolonged exposure cannot be
quantified in monetary terms.


Stated Product Compliance and Regulatory Environment


Lumber Liquidators officially states that all of its products are CARB compliant. In fact,
labeling on the boxes of its flooring products clearly states the product is California 93120
Phase 2 compliant for Formaldehyde in plywood. Also, Lumber Liquidators' representative
stated the following on the Q&A section of its own website:

"Q: Does this product use urea formaldehyde and does it have low or no VOC?


Asked on 12/2/2012 by Aimee from Houston, TX


A: The adhesive that is used in bonding our Bamboo, Cork, Engineered, and
Laminate flooring products contain very low amounts of Urea Formaldehyde. We feel
that our products are very safe and most meet California CARB Phase I or California
Phase II regulations, which is listed on the boxes. We also list MSDS sheets for most
of these products on the Lumber Liquidators website "Flooring 101."


Answered on 12/10/2012 by cc-2"


Significant amounts of governmental regulations pertain to the use of formaldehyde in
composite wood products such as engineered or laminated flooring products. The state of
California pioneered the Airborne Toxic Control Measure (OTC:ATCM), which applies to all
composite wood products sold in the state of California. In 2010, President Obama signed
the Formaldehyde Standards for Composite Wood Products Act into law. The emission
standards contained in EPA's proposed implementation are identical to the CARB
regulations.


Specifically, the California Air Resources Board requires formaldehyde emission standard
compliance from distributors and importers. Lumber Liquidators is certainly subject to
CARB regulations.


Compliance Schedule and Emission Standard:


Specifically, CARB dictates that all HWPW (Hardwood Plywood) products sold in the state
of California should emit no more than 0.05 ppm (parts per million) as determined per
relevant testing methods. Violations of CARB regulations may result in severe penalties

assessed against the offending entities. A general overview of the relevant CARB
regulations can be found here.


Enforcement against Noncompliance


Lab Testing Shows Lumber Liquidators Lacks Effective Product Quality Control


I recently conducted independent lab testing - engaging Berkeley Analytical, an IAS
accredited testing laboratory -- on a sample of Lumber Liquidators house brand flooring
("Mayflower" brand), and the results that came back weren't pretty: Over 3.5x the
maximum legal level for formaldehyde. (This product was purchased retail from a
Southern California retail store.) Fully understanding the importance of this finding, we
submitted samples from the same package to a second laboratory, this one the "gold
standard" lab for the National Wood Flooring Association, NTA. This second lab confirms
the product is in violation of the legal limit for formaldehyde.


Lumber Liquidators officially states its products are CARB compliant despite all the
negative consumer reviews. It is naturally suspicious due to the apparent disconnect
between those concerning consumer reviews and the Company's position on its product
quality. To investigate, some products were purchased from a retail store in Los Angeles
and were sent for lab testing for CARB compliance. Due to the prohibitive costs and
efforts in carrying out the testing, only a limited number of samples were collected. The
testing specifically focused on the Company's brand name Bellawood and the Company's
imported product from China. While the Bellawood product came back compliant with the
relevant regulations, the imported product from China tested emitting 0.17 ppm, three and
half times the government mandated maximum emission level. The test was carried out by
Berkeley Analytical, an IAS accredited lab. The same test performed by another
independent accredited lab, NTA, also shows noncompliance.

Lab Results:


Lab reports can be found here and here.


The results show some of Lumber Liquidators' products significantly exceed the
government mandated limits and the Company does not have proper internal quality
control process to ensure the safety of its products. The tested product, Mayflower 5/16" x
5" Bund Birch Engineered, emits a staggering three and half times over the government
mandated maximum emission level. The product is clearly not CARB compliant yet
Lumber Liquidators tagged CARB compliance on the box. As retailer and importer of this
product, Lumber Liquidators is strictly liable for the violation per ATCM. It is unclear how
many types or batches of Lumber Liquidators' products are noncompliant but certified as
compliant. The gross violation of the one product tested shows a clear lack to product
quality control process. With the rampant negative consumer reviews, it is very likely a
material portion of Lumber Liquidators' 210 million USD inventory could be noncompliant
and they should be re-tested and properly certified before being sold to any consumer.
Further, reading prior reviews submitted by other consumers referenced above, Lumber
Liquidators appears to be no stranger to the issue of formaldehyde. Instead of taking
drastic actions to ensure product quality and preventing toxic products from entering
people's homes, noncompliant product is still being sold today by Lumber Liquidators. The
Company appears to be willfully violating regulations in an egregious fashion.


Regulatory and Legal Consequences of Violations


Arguably, should the formaldehyde issue gain traction with consumers, the consumer
market itself should cause grave economic consequences for Lumber Liquidators. Just
like with A&W, consumers will simply walk away and purchase products from better
brands such as Home Depot and Lowe's. Yet as a U.S. Company, Lumber Liquidators

https://seekingalpha.com/article/1513142-illegal-products-could-spell-big-trouble-at-lumber-liquidators 11/38


could face additional consequences beyond abandonment by consumers. Prior
enforcement action and class action lawsuits related to formaldehyde suggest the
Company could be on the hook for significant class action settlements and government
enforcement actions. It will likely be required to recall all problematic products sold to
consumers, which would be prohibitively expensive for a flooring company. Further,
Lumber Liquidators will need to conduct a comprehensive review of its inventory to assess
the extent of its noncompliance. At the end of first quarter 2013, Lumber Liquidators has a
total cash balance of $72 million. With significant overhead running coupled with legal
consequences, if the Company were to face mass consumer exodus due to a lack of
confidence in the safety of its products, bankruptcy is not an inconceivable scenario.


"Stationary Sources and Consumer Products (Part 4 of Division 26, HSC)


There are civil penalties (sections 42401 through 42403) and criminal penalties
(sections 42400 through 42400.8). Violators may be punished using either, but not
both (section 42400.7). Most violations are punished civilly. Maximum penalty
amounts are based on the degree of a violator's intent. The range begins at $1,000
per violation per day, which can be imposed with no finding of intent (strict liability).
Penalties top at $1 million per violation per day for corporate violators and $250,000
per violation per day for individuals, in cases of willful and intentional emissions of air
contaminants that result in great bodily harm or death. ARB also can obtain a court
order or "injunction" to stop violations from taking place (section 41513). In criminal
cases, violators also face possible jail sentences of 30 days to 1 year per violation
per day.


Part 4 penalty provisions also apply to violations of ARB's consumer products
regulations (Title 17, California Code of Regulations, sections 94500-94575), and
indoor air cleaner regulations (sections 94800-94810). The list of factors that must
be considered in determining a penalty under Part 4 (section 42403) is similar to
those required under SB 1402 (section 43024)."


Investors should also pay close attention to two formaldehyde related class-action
lawsuits and enforcement actions.


The California Air Resources Board took enforcement action on a hair product. In the
settlement related to the suit, Brazilian Blowout Products was required to refund all
products sold. The number comes out to be roughly $4.5 million for the company. It is
difficult to assess the amount of damage should Lumber Liquidators be involved in such a
suit. The penalty will definitely depend upon the length of time over which Lumber

Liquidators was non-compliant, but it seems reasonable the Company could be liable for
the full value of whatever revenue it received from selling the noncompliant flooring
products, at a minimum.


"In a class action suit, 10 plaintiffs in March negotiated a preliminary $4 million
settlement with GIB, which includes payments to consumers of $35 an application,
with a limit of three, and a $75 reimbursement per bottle to stylists. The plaintiffs
estimate that over the years up until December, about 15,700 U.S. stylists had
purchased Brazilian Blowout directly from GIB and about 100,000 customers had
paid for the treatment. The settlement also proposes to resolve a pending federal
class action suit."


Another similar class action lawsuit relates to excessive formaldehyde emission from
trailers provided for hurricane victims. The lawsuit was settled for over $30 million.


The "cause for action" are fraud, negligence, and false advertising. The lawsuit was
brought in a federal district court, with the plaintiffs from all over the U.S.


It is impossible for an investigator such as me to fully assess the impacts of Lumber
Liquidators' vulnerabilities to its business from this finding. How many brands and SKUs
show formaldehyde contamination. How long has such product been distributed in the
U.S.? (all US product is distributed from a single point of supply, so it is highly unlikely that
my finding is isolated.) In addition to the sky-high valuation, investors in Lumber
Liquidators should be aware of the following risks facing the Company.


1. Amount of installed product in customers' homes and businesses to be removed and
replaced -- unknown


2. Amount of product to be withdrawn from inventory -- disposition and costs unknown
3. Litigation liability for misrepresentation, financial and health damages -- likely through


consumer class action -- impacts unquantifiable
4. Shareholder lawsuits against management for gross misrepresentation -- damages


unknown
5. Regulatory fines and costs for misrepresented products -- damages unknown
6. Reputation damage -- impossible to quantify -- lower revenues, tarnished brand
7. Growth plans -- likely suspension for a significant period
8. Margin contraction -- likely lowered due to removal from sales mix of low-cost, high-


margin substandard Chinese products

The proposed short thesis above does not deal with the valuation of the Company.
Therefore, it is probably helpful for investors to get the perspective from a leading financial
publication. Grant's is an independent, value-oriented and contrary-minded journal of

bullish enough, sell-side analysts are ratcheting up their price targets even as the
latest S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, for February, shows a 9.3% year-over-
year gain, the most since May 2006. In short, here is an apparent state of perfection.
But only apparent: "The bullish Lumber Liquidators' story revolves around the
potential opportunity for the company to open 600 stores in the United States over
the next couple of years and to take market share from independent floor-covering
retailers," Peligal relates. "Lumber Liquidators owns a 10.5% market share,
management estimates. Other contenders in the American hardwood and laminate
market are home centers like Home Depot and Lowe's, with a combined share of
27%, and everybody else with 62%.


While one can understand the bullish thesis, it's interesting to note that LL's sales
per store are flattish over the past couple of years. "Now it's true," Peligal continues,
"that new stores cannibalize old stores, but let's make the generous assumption that
a mature LL store can generate $3.5 million of revenues per year. Furthermore,
assume LL can open a total of 600 stores, and that total revenue at some point in
the future will be $2.1 billion (600 stores times $3.5 million per store). Say, in
addition, that LL can take share from independent retailers and that operating
margin climbs to 14%. You would then have $294 million in earnings before interest
and taxes ($2.1 billion in future revenues times a 14% margin). Because, at this
indeterminate point in the future, LL will have become a mature retail concept, apply
a multiple of 14. You get about $2.6 billion of value, or perhaps $2.4 billion, as the
stores don't just build themselves.


And that is essentially where the stock is valued today. If you put any kind of
discount rate on it, the share price would immediately sink, because it might take six
or eight years to finish the construction. Thus, at these levels, LL is a different kind of
lottery ticket. In a way, you're buying a low-cost put on housing. If a surprise
outbreak of inflation pushed up mortgage rates, or a surprise outbreak of deflation
pushed down house prices, the price of a share of LL could come down from the
ceiling to a spot much nearer the floor." Peligal got on the phone to check with some
of the independent flooring retailers on whose market share Lumber Liquidators will

ostensibly feast. "What is their name?" a New Jersey merchant rhetorically asked in
reply to Peligal's question. "Lumber Liquidators," he answered himself." You know
what liquidators means? It's the stuff nobody else wants." The man from the Garden
State asked to remain anonymous. So did a retailer from Maryland. "I'm the general
manager of this company, and I've been in the industry for 26 years now," our
informant said. "The reputation of Lumber Liquidators is that they are the dumpster
of the industry." The author of a Yelp review of the Lumber Liquidators' store on E
1st St. in Manhattan, dated Dec.10, 2012, was only one-half anonymous. "The wood
that they sell you is of poor quality, even if it's Bellawood hardwood," wrote Sarah F.
"The planks are not the same width across their length, and they are not durable at
all. I've had my floor for less than six months and it looks awful already." The Web
site Reseller Ratings posts 63 customer reviews of Lumber Liquidators. On a 10-
point scale, LL scores 3.61 for pricing and services, 0.63 for shipping and packaging
and 0.56 for customer service. "Save yourself a major headache by running as
quickly [as possible] in the other direction as if your hair was on fire!" writes
customer Kate Olen, of Kissimmee, Fla. Evidence that not every single Internet
commentator is angry are the reviews posted on Reseller Ratings for True
Hardwoods of Calhoun, Ga. Here, the scores run 9.62 for product and service 9.81
for shipping and packaging and a perfect 10 for customer service; 39 customers
contributed. Reached for comment, the LL investor-relations contact replied that the
majority of her company's products are first quality, with odd lots and second  quality
goods accounting for only 5% of volume. As for hardwood, she said, it's a natural
product, and people have unreasonably high expectations about the uniformity of the
wood. "Well," she explains, "that's how the trees grow."


Notably, the short sellers in LL are not the only sellers. Thomas Sullivan, founder
and chairman of Lumber Liquidators, has been a consistent seller over the past two
years, including 200,000 shares between May 3 and May 6 at prices in the low $80s
(which leaves him 708,998 shares). Follow the leader, we say."


Conclusion


As described in Grant, investors in Lumber Liquidators today are certainly ignoring all the
conventional valuation metrics. The discount rate or total addressable market certainly
does not come into investors' minds. However, investors should not overlook the issue
surrounding Lumber Liquidators' product quality; especially when the quality issue extends
into the safety and well-being of Lumber Liquidators' customers.
