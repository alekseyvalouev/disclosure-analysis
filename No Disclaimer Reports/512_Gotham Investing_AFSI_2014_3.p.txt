AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part II

Summary


Consolidated Statutory Capital Appears Quite Weak.


AFSI Is Likely Insolvent After Adjusting for Accounting Issues.


AFSI Benefits from "Regulatory Arbitrage" Through Use of Offshore Subsidiaries;
NYDFS Conditions Indicate That Tide Is Turning Though.


Additional Potential Catalysts Could Accelerate AFSI's Demise.


Part I Recap:


In "AmTrust Financial Services: A P&C Blow-Up In The Making - Part I", I discussed
AFSI's similarities with prior blow-ups, analyzed the conditions that the New York
Department of Financial Services ("NYDFS") recently imposed upon AmTrust Financial
Services, Inc. (AFSI), and I highlighted the inconsistencies among various disclosures and
"explanations" AFSI management has provided with respect to whether or not AFSI is
reflecting the losses ceded to Luxembourg in its SEC filings.


Part II: Insolvency, Turning Tides & Fault Lines


The remainder of this article is organized as follows:


I. Consolidated Statutory Capital Appears Quite Weak


As discussed in Part I, Condition #2 imposed on AFSI by the NYDFS was a maximum net
premiums written ("NPW") to surplus ratio of 3:1.

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 2/24


I then provided my estimate of consolidated statutory capital (since the company only
provides individual subsidiaries without providing the eliminating entries) by making
adjustments to the U.S. GAAP financial statements in light of the differences between
GAAP and statutory accounting.


Based on this analysis, I estimate AFSI's NPW / Consolidated Statutory Capital is
approximately 4.0x as the table below sets forth.


II. My Analysis Indicates AFSI Is Insolvent After Adjusting for Accounting Issues


The analysis in Section I assumes that AFSI's GAAP financials are correct and thus a
valid starting point. However, I and others have serious concerns about the veracity of
AFSI's accounting. Adjusted for these accounting concerns (detailed below), AFSI
appears to be insolvent.


There are four adjustments that I believe should be made to AFSI's financial statements to
estimate AFSI's true consolidated statutory capital:


1. Unrecognized losses ceded to wholly-owned Luxembourg Reinsurance Captives
("LRCs"),


2. Discrepancies between AFSI's financial statements and related party Maiden Holdings
(NASDAQ:MHLD),


3. Over-valuation of life settlement contracts, and

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 3/24


4. Unrecognized deferred tax liabilities.


With Consolidated Statutory Capital of $75.3 million, AFSI would be well below
amounts required by insurance regulators, so I would expect the insurance
subsidiaries to be taken into receivership with debt holders receiving anything left
over thus leaving equity holders with nothing.


Adjustment #1: Unrecognized losses ceded to wholly-owned Luxembourg
Reinsurance Captives


As discussed in Part I, AFSI management has provided several "explanations" that seem
to contradict one another and/or other company disclosures which indicates AFSI does
not have a good, straightforward answer to the criticism raised by GeoInvesting and
(implicitly) Barron's. and that the net losses (loss and loss adjustment expenses in excess
of premiums) ceded to LRCs.


To quantify the amount of unrecognized losses ceded to Luxembourg, I rely on the 2013
Financial Statements of AHL (available at www.gbrdirect.eu) which show a cumulative
acquisition cost of $993.1 million and a fair market value of $671.9 million:

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 4/24


One should adjust the cumulative impairments (acquisition cost less fair market value) for
the valuation methodology used in the AHL filings in the excerpt below:


As a result, I estimate that the cumulative unrecognized losses ceded to LRCs is
approximately $356.9 million.

As noted in Part I, AFSI's description of what occurred in 2013 matches the financial
statements of AmTrust Re Theta, but it does not match the 2013 Schedule Y.


I suspect it is the Schedule Y that is incorrect because in prior years (2009-2012) the
methodology closely approximated one another:


As such, I rely on the 2013 AHL financial statements to estimate the cumulative
unrecognized losses ceded to LRCs.


Since I am using the 2q14 balance sheet, one also has to consider the year-to-date losses
ceded to LRCs as well though. I estimate the year-to-date losses ceded to LRCs by
calculating the implicit net loss ceded using the deferred tax liability ("DTL") reversals
associated with (unrecognized) losses ceded to LRCs. DTL reversals were $18.6 million in
the first half of 2014 (emphasis added):


"The effective rate decreased during the three months ended June 30, 2014
primarily from the reduction of the deferred tax liability attributable to the
equalization reserves of our Luxembourg reinsurers of approximately of $18.6
million and $4.5 million during the three months ended June 30, 2014 and 2013,
respectively."


As a result, I estimate that the cumulative amount of unrecognized net losses ceded
to LRCs was approximately $418.6 million as of June 30, 2014.


Adjustment #2: Discrepancies between AFSI's financial statements and related
party MHLD


Barron's second article, "Balance Sheet Risk Makes AmTrust Vulnerable", by Bill Alpert
raised concerns about the approximately $400 million discrepancies between AFSI's
assets and MHLD's corresponding liabilities (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 6/24


THE REINSURANCE RELATIONSHIP between AmTrust and Maiden is substantial,
with AmTrust passing along 40% of most premiums and losses to Maiden. Yet
AmTrust's year-end balance sheet showed about $1.9 billion in assets
receivable from Maiden, while the latter's balance sheet reported
corresponding liabilities due AmTrust to be worth less than $1.5 billion. That
$400 million variance seems to lie mainly in the companies' different reserve
estimates for policyholder losses not yet reported to the insurers. But such a
large disagreement invites the question of whether Maiden is understating its
liabilities or AmTrust is overstating its assets.


Maiden Investor Relations V.P. Noah Fields says that timing differences in the
companies' balance sheets account for 40% of the variance. Maiden's financial
statements appropriately reflect the AmTrust reinsurance relationship, he says.


AmTrust's Malone says both sets of books are correct, with the difference arising
from the fact that Maiden estimates yet-to-be-reported losses independently of
AmTrust. Maiden must post collateral for its reinsurance obligations, she notes.
That's an interesting point, because collateral reported by Maiden only seems
sufficient by Maiden's count (the two insurers' contract requires collateral that's
102% of Maiden's liabilities) but appears insufficient by AmTrust's accounting, as we
show in the chart on this page. Maiden's Fields says his firm's collateral is sufficient.


In AFSI's "Response to Barron's", AFSI noted a $108 million classification differences and
an unspecified amount due to "timing differences" and foreign exchange, but attributed the
remainder to different estimates of ultimate losses, which seems to validate the concern
implied by the question raised (emphasis added):

"7. Cessions to Maiden. Mr. Alpert incorrectly asserts that there is a $400 million
variance between AmTrust's and Maiden's accounting for the business AmTrust
cedes to Maiden. Mr. Alpert asked for the Company to respond to this assertion. See
Part B - Question 10 and the Company's response below. In addition, differences
between prepaid premium reported by AmTrust and unearned premium reported by
Maiden primarily relates to business written by AmTrust late in the year which was
not ceded to Maiden as of year- end. There also are other timing differences and
difference arising out of foreign exchange rates. AmTrust's reinsurance
recoverable balance include $108 million of losses paid by AmTrust, but not
yet reimbursed by Maiden, which Maiden books as paid losses.


The balance of the difference relates to valuation differences between
AmTrust's ceded ultimate loss estimates and Maiden's assumed ultimate loss
estimates..."


The company also provided their written exchange, which indicates the main difference is
in IBNR (incurred but not yet reported) reserves (emphasis added):

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 8/24


Question 10: As of year-end 2013, the AFSI balance sheet seemed to show $400
million more in assets relating to the Maiden Holdings quota share ($740 million in
prepaid premiums plus $1,144 million in reinsurance recoverable) than the
corresponding liabilities on Maiden's balance sheet ($687 million in unearned
premiums plus $796million in loss and loss adjustment expense reserves)...If that
$400 million difference in the corresponding numbers is correct, is AFSI overstating
or MHLD understating?


Company's Response to Question 10: AmTrust is not overstating reserves or
unearned premium ceded to Maiden and there is no basis for concluding that
Maiden is understating them. Each quarter AmTrust provides a cession statement to
Maiden which shows changes in written premium, changes in unearned premium,
ceding commission, and changes in pure incurred losses. Pure incurred losses
consist of changes in paid losses and case reserves and do not include IBNR.
These cessions are made to Maiden strictly in accordance with the terms of the
reinsurance contracts and, in particular, the agreed upon quota share percentages.


We do not provide Maiden an IBNR calculation and we do not review Maiden's
IBNR calculation. IBNR is determined by insurers and reinsurers on an
aggregate basis. In the case of reinsurers, IBNR is developed for the reinsurers'
business as a whole and then allocated among its cedents. We would not expect the
IBNR allocated by Maiden to its AmTrust business to match our IBNR. This is true of
all reinsurance relationships, not only AmTrust's relationship with Maiden..."


It is unclear whether estimates used by AFSI or MHLD will be correct, but one thing is
clear: one will be wrong and that is likely to cause a problem for AFSI.


If AFSI is over-stating their reinsurance recoverables and/or prepaid reinsurance
premiums, their book value and consolidated surplus would be over-stated. If AFSI is
correct, their primary reinsurance counterparty is substantially under-reserved, in which
case they may not be able to collect on all of their reinsurance recoverables.


For the sake of simplicity, I have assumed that the error is split between the two parties
evenly:

Adjustment #3: Over-stated Value of Life Settlement Contracts


AFSI reports $276.2 million of life settlement contracts on their balance sheet. Net of the
50% non-controlling interest owned by National General Holdings (NASDAQ:NGHC),
AFSI's portion of the investment is carried at approximately $138.1 million.


GeoInvesting and others have criticized AFSI's valuation approach and provided analysis
that suggests AFSI's methodology is aggressive relative to peers, primarily due to the use
of a 7.5% discount rate which AFSI argues is not comparable to peers' discount rate
because AFSI has "reserves".


However, a close comparison indicates that AFSI's "reserves" are actually quite
similar to the adjustments IFT makes before applying a discount rate of
approximately 20%(!).


The aggressiveness of AFSI's valuation methodology can be seen empirically in the filings
of AMT Capital Holdings ("AMTCH"), which files annual statements that are available at
www.gbrdirect.eu.


Below are excerpts of AMTCH's 2011-2013 Annual Filings:

Note that depite ZERO realized gains, AMTCH has generated approximately $28.2 million
of gains ($65.0 - $36.8) on a cumulative cost of $36.8 million -- these are either brilliant
purchases (unlikely since they recognize the gains up-front rather than over time) or bad
accounting. I suspect it's the latter.


The table below provides a summary of AMTCH's activity:


Note that the carrying value is converging with cost as it eventually has to in all instances.
However, the degree to which cost and fair market value diverge is unusual and indicative
of off-market assumptions, which corroborates the concerns I had based on the qualitative
disclosures around reserves.

Adjustment #4: Unrecognized deferred tax liabilities


In AFSI 2q14 10-Q, AFSI disclosed that they have substantial unrecognized DTLs:


"At June 30, 2014 and December 31, 2013, the financial reporting basis in excess of
the tax basis for which no deferred taxes have been recognized was approximately
$463,300 and $360,000, respectively."


I believe AFSI will be forced to recognize these DTLs upon repatriation of capital to the US
in order to fill the balance sheet deficiencies that arise as the NYDFS conditions are
imposed. Using AFSI's tax rate guidance of 28% (likely higher to repatriate to the US), I
estimated the unrecognized DTL is approximately $129.6 million:


III. AFSI Benefits from "Regulatory Arbitrage" Through Use of Offshore Subsidiaries;
NYDFS Conditions Indicate That Tide Is Turning Though


According to AM Best, state regulators have established a guideline of no more than 3:1
NPW-to-Surplus.


So how did AFSI get to 4.0x? I believe the answer is "regulatory arbitrage" that was
effected by shifting substantial amounts of AFSI's retained exposures to Bermuda where
higher leverage is accepted and capital requirements for the type of entity that AFSI has
(Class 3) are not risk-based. Unfortunately for AFSI and its investors, the tide appears to
be turning.


Regulatory Arbitrage #1: Shifting Premiums to Low Capital Jurisdictions

https://seekingalpha.com/article/2623745-amtrust-financial-services-a-p-and-c-blow-up-in-the-making-part-ii 13/24


AFSI appears to have aggressively exploited a regulatory blindspot similar to the one the
NYDFS warned about in "Shining a Light on Shadow Insurance" by having its insurance
subsidiaries send over half of their consolidated NPW ($1,473.5 million / $2,565.7 million)
to AmTrust International Insurance ("AII") in Bermuda where leverage can be as high as
6.67x NPW / Statutory Capital.


However, as discussed in Part I, NYDFS condition #2 will cap leverage at three times. It
will also reduce the amount ceded to AII (from 70% to 50%) which will increase the portion
of retained exposures subjected to risk-based capital requirements.


Regulatory Arbitrage #2: Exploiting the Difference Between Stated Capital vs. Risk-Based
Capital


AFSI (via AII) took their scheme one step further and contributed other insurance
subsidiaries to AII so that AII could count their equity as an asset even though that equity
was already being used (and will continue to be used) as regulatory capital for the
contributed subsidiaries.


Industry participants often refer to this as "stacking" and risk-based capital measurements
adjust for it, but the Bermuda Monetary Authority, which overseas insurers in Bermuda,
makes no such adjustment.


The Federal Insurance Office's inaugural report, highlighted this issue as a focus of the
"E.U.-U.S. Insurance Project" (emphasis added):

The excerpts below are from Technology Insurance Company (US Subsidiary of AFSI).
They show that AII owned a number of other AFSI subsidiaries directly and indirectly,
including several regulated insurance companies (in red) and most of AFSI's life
settlement entities (in blue).

Source: Technology Insurance Company (AFSI Subsidiary) Schedule Y, Part I


Since the regulated insurance companies are subject to dividend restrictions and must
keep a capital buffer against their retained exposures, much of what AII owns is neither
liquid nor able to pay meaningful dividends to AII should AII need additional cash to fund
higher than expected claims. As a result, they provide AII with fewer resources with which
to pay claims than what AII carries them at as assets.


On a related note, AII's ownership of life settlement entities does not provide them with
liquid assets to meet its obligations - quite the opposite actually because those entities
have to continue paying premiums in order to realize the potential value. As such, the life
settlement entities serve to exacerbate AII's shortage of liquid assets.


I suspect AFSI continues to invest in them because the Company's off-market discount
rate allows them to "create" significant capital for AII while acknowledging that they are
over-marked would impair AII's capital position.


This creates an interesting problem for AII. Its thin capitalization means they are
loathe to take a write-down on AFSI's life settlement contracts, but each premium
payment they make (or contribution to entities that make the payments) drain AII of
their already scare liquid assets. By continuing with these investments, AFSI risks
an acute liquidity crisis at their largest subsidiary (AII). The only way out of this is a
significant capital raise.

Combining the organizational structure above with the disclosures in AFSI's 10-K
(Footnote 22) and National General Holdings Corp.'s 10-K (NGHC) disclosures of
individual life settlement entities allows us to calculate the amount of capital AII receives
from assets that provide limited, if any ability to pay claims, as the table below sets forth.


In AFSI's "Response to Barron's", the Company implicitly validated this approach on a
subset of the entities discussed above (emphasis added):


Question 7: AmTrust subsidiaries' 2013 Schedule Y, Part 1A show AII owning about
$300 million worth of affiliates like Rochdale, AIUL (Ireland) and AEL (NASDAQ:UK)
that all retain some risk, so how accessible is that piece of AII's capital?


Company's Response to Question 7: Schedule Ypart 1 does not show any
capital/surplus amounts. Therefore, Schedule Y part 1 does not show that AII owns
about $300 million worth of affiliates.


AII owns Amtrust International Management, which owns 50% of Amtrust
Equity Solutions, which owns Rochdale, AIUL as well as IGI - AII's total
indirect ownership of those three companies is $237 million.


(Editorial note: My numbers for these three entities match, but AFSI left out MIC.
The life settlement entities were not considered in Barron's question or AFSI's
response.)


The capital of Rochdale, AIUL and AEL is very accessible. The total statutory capital
of the companies mentioned is $475 million and is 3.7 times those same entities
required capital of $128 million. The company could reallocate capital if necessary.
In addition, the combined liquid assets of Rochdale, AIUL and AEL is over $1.0
billion.

In other words, AII intends to use the capital of AIUL, AEL, Rochdale, et al to pay off
claims that AII owes to...AIUL, AEL, Rochdale, et al.


Also, I find it interesting that AFSI says they can "reallocate capital" because any
dividends from Rochdale, AIUL, or AEL would increase AII's cash, but it would reduce
AII's carrying value in these entities by the same amount. Therefore, AFSI cannot
"reallocate capital".


Furthermore, AIUL cannot pay any dividends without the prior approval of the Irish Central
Bank, and Rochdale is subject to dividend restrictions as well. There is no disclosure of
the dividend capacity for AEL or MIC, but MIC's capital is under 1.3x the regulatory
minimum amount, so it is unlikely AII could extract any cash from MIC.


It is concerning that AII has assets that may not be available to it of $355.2 million when
it's reported capital is only $416.0 million. This means that AII's effective capital is
meaningfully below the regulatory requirement of $194.6 million (which is already a rather
generous standard), and adverse development attributable to AII of approximately $60
million or more would not be serviceable by AII thus meaningfully increasing the capital
requirements of AFSI's US subsidiaries.


In case you think I'm being dramatic, this is exactly what happened to TWGP, which was
one of the few other companies with this regulatory arbitraging structure (emphasis
added):


"As of March 31, 2014, CastlePoint Re is required to collateralize $603.5 million
of its assumed reserves in a reinsurance trust for the benefit of TICNY, the lead pool
company of the U.S. insurance companies. As of March 31, 2014, CastlePoint Re
held $555.4 million in its reinsurance trust."


However, TWGP's Bermuda reinsurance captive had more capital buffer before its
significant adverse development charges and did not have inaccessible capital in the form
of equity in affiliates or life settlements. For this reason, I believe the shortfall at AII could
be even more sever when AFSI finally reports the adverse development that my reserve
analysis indicates is coming.
