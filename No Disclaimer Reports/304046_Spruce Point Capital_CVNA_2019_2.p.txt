iRobot / IRBT Echo Global / ECHO BazaarVoice / BV


Report May 2015 / June 2017 Sept 2016 May 2012


Enterprise Value $2.5 billion $1.1 billion $1.2 billion


Company 
Promotion / 


Situation 
Overview


Innovative robotics company capable of 
leveraging its success in robotics vacuums into 
other product categories such as telehealth, 


and lawn mower robots


Innovative technology disruptor in the third-party 
logistics space, hyping multiple iterations of its 
ETM and Optimizer technology, while quietly 


churning through five CTOs


Disruptive provider of social commerce solutions 
that help clients capture, display and analyze 
online word-of-mouth, including consumer-


generated ratings and reviews


Our Criticism Failures to innovate and repeated promises to 
diversify into other categories. Company is 
more a promotional vehicle for insiders to 
consistently sell stock at inflated multiples, 


while masking pressure through related 
distributor acquisitions 


Management has a history of associating itself 
with companies that were touted as technology 
disruptors, but which ultimately fizzled out and 


had no lasting endurance. Notably:  Groupon and 
Innerworkings, both which had earnings 


restatements


Our research revealed that BV’s solution was 
nothing more than a money losing, rapidly 


commoditized service that would not scale. Its 
IPO prospectus was littered with social media 


buzz words at a time when Facebook was being 
taken public, and $25 analyst price targets would 


prove unrealistic


Successful 
Outcome


iRobot’s home vacuum market share has been 
significantly eroded by new entrants, forcing 
significant price compression. Its telehealth 


robots have failed to deliver any upside, while 
it finally just launched a lawn mower vacuum 


in Feb 2019, yet has not been able to articulate 
the price or distribution strategy into the U.S. 


In Q2’17 ECHO cut its FY17 revenue outlook and 
suspended longer-term guidance given changes 


in its end market and failure to hit synergy 
targets with Command. ECHO sell-side brokers 


downgraded their recommendations from Buy to 
Hold. ECHO’s shares fell to a 52 week low of $13, 


or nearly 50%


BV’s CFO and CEO eventually resigned and its 
share price fizzled to low single digits before


ultimately being acquired for just $5.50/sh, 54% 
below its $12 IPO price and 70% below our 


initiation price

Q4 2018 Update
5


Spruce Point Reiterates Downside Risk In CVNA, Cuts 
Price Target On Worsening Financial Performance


Recent Financial Results Disappointed For the Quarter And The 2019 Outlook 
 Q4’18 Results Disappoint By A Mile: 


• Retail Units: 27,750 (vs Bloomberg cons 29,200, vs guidance 27,500 - 30,000)
• Reported Revenue: $535m v $605m expected (original guidance: $570m – $630m)
• Total GPU: $2,131 ex gift (vs cons $2,150. vs guidance $2,000 - $2,250 ex-gift)
• EBITDA: -$63.2m (vs cons -$56.2m)
• Adj EPS: Losses intensified to -$0.55 v -$0.49 expected
• Operating Cash Burn: -$414.3m for the year, up from -$199.9m YoY (more than double the burn, with sales up 114%)


 FY 2019 Guidance Also Sorely Disappointed:


• Retail Units: 160,000-165,000 (vs cons ~170,000)
• Total GPU: $2,450-$2,650 (vs cons $2,650)
• Revenue: $3.4bn-$3.5bn (vs cons $3.6bn)


Most Importantly: Carvana Suspended Giving Q1 2019 Guidance
• By reporting on Feb 27th, Carvana is already 2/3rds through the quarter and should be able to provide investors visibility into 


expected results


• Why can’t it offer an outlook, and what, if anything, is the Company hiding?


Spruce Point believes that the recent terrible financial results reported by Carvana continue to validate our concern 
about its uneconomic business model that isn’t scaling, is capital destructive, and favors insider enrichment over 


shareholder wealth creation. Our revised price target is $7.50 - $19.60 (56% to 83%)
6


Financing Needs Becoming More Obvious While 
Management Puts Self-Interest Ahead Of Investors


At The Current Burn Rate of $1.1m/Day, Carvana Had Just 70 Days of Operating Cash On Hand At Yr End
• Current burn rate implies $414.4m of annual cash burn over 365 days
• As of Q4, Unrestricted Cash Equivalents were $78.8m as of 12/31/18
• We estimate just $12.8m of unrestricted cash on hand by March 1st
• Other liquidity alternatives include going further into debt by tapping the floor plan facility and/or sale leaseback agreements


with $331m of capacity. However, this could be incrementally negative from a credit perspective


• We caution investors that Carvana’s stated belief that it won’t need to raise additional debt or equity appears aggressive. 
Importantly, management has a poor track record of hitting its stated financial targets.


With Increased Cash Burn, Disappointing Guidance, And A Suspension of Q1 Guidance, How Is Management Behaving?
• In our opinion, very poorly. We observe that Carvana’s Board granted management a nearly 100% base salary pay raises 
• “The Board also approved annual base salary increases for the Company's executive officers as part of its annual performance 


review, including Ernie Garcia III, the Company's Chief Executive Officer, whose annual base salary was increased from $400,000 
to $885,000, Mark Jenkins, the Company's Chief Financial Officer, whose annual base salary was increased from $375,000 to 
$735,000, and Benjamin Huston, the Company's Chief Operating Officer, whose annual base salary was increased from $375,000 
to $735,000. The salary increase were approved retroactively to January 1, 2019, consistent with the Company's practices for 
annual merit increases.”


• We warned about the Board not appearing to be “independent” and not acting in the best interest of outside investors. We 
believe this validates our concerns. 


• With profitability becoming more elusive and the cash burn accelerating, under no circumstances do we believe management 
deserves a 100% base pay raise


• If management were concerned about investors, it could have taken more stock in lieu of cash


In Spruce Point’s opinion, Carvana will require more equity capital to continue operations, and has limited flexibility to 
incur more debt given its deep junk CCC rating. Yet, despite the accelerating cash burn, management received a 100% 
increase in cash compensation at the approval of an “independent” Board, further compounding the pain to investors.
7


Low “Quality” GPU Concerns Intensify


Gross profit from retail used vehicle sales now contributes just ~40% of total GPU (on a common-weighted basis). This 
is as low as this metric has been since the Company went public. Retail sales have typically been responsible for closer 


to 50% of GPU.


Meanwhile, loan sales and “other” was responsible for 58% of GPU, up from 48% in Q3. This is the highest this metric 
has been since the Company went public. Recall that this portion of Carvana’s gross profit represents its gain on the 
sale of what are largely subprime auto receivables. This questionable and perhaps unsustainable source of income is 


now responsible for a greater share of profit than it ever has been since Carvana went public.


Notably, Carvana’s gains on its refinancing maneuver ($2.4M), together with its new and questionable VSC “excess 
reserve reimbursement” paid by DriveTime ($1.9M), was responsible for 8% of GPU.

Spruce Point Is Not The Only Analyst To Issue 
Caution On Carvana


 Retail Unit Sales: With 65% US population coverage adding another 22M POPs vs. our previous estimate for an additional 
36M POPs (67.6% population coverage 160k - 165k. For 2023, we are lowering our estimate from ~440k to ~420k Retail Units 
Sold. This has ~$1 negative impact to our price target)


 Gross Profit Per Unit: For 2019, we are modeling $2,453 vs. management guidance for $2,450 - $2,650 vs. our previous 
estimate of $2,410.


 % Adjusted EBITDA: For 2019, we are modeling -4.6% vs. management guidance for -3.5% to -5.5% vs. our previous estimate 
of -5.1%.


 Free Cash Flow: Free Cash Flow was -$186M in 4Q18, or -$339M after adjusting for the change in the Floor Plan Facility, 
putting the cash balance at $79M. This compares to our previous estimate of -$170M, or -$109M after adjusting for the 
change in the Floor Plan Facility. We are now modeling positive free cash flow in 2024 vs. our previous estimate for positive
free cash flow in 2023. This has ~$1 negative impact to our price target


 We reiterate our UW rating, and lower our price target from $23 to $21. Our new price target of $21 (vs. $23 previously) is 
based on 12.0x 2023 EBITDA of $398M (vs. 12.0x 2023 EBITDA of $420M). The price target is ~$1 lower due to retail unit 
sales and ~$1 lower due to the cash balance. 12.0x 2023 EV / EBITDA is a discount to the historical multiple for KMX, the 
most direct comp for CVNA, but the approach is consistent with our Base Case / Price Target for KMX. We are constructive 
on CVNA's ability to disrupt the used car dealership model. However, we believe this potential upside is more than priced 
into the stock, and our 2023 EBITDA estimate is 50%+ below consensus, as the focus shifts from market expansion to 
market penetration. We believe that it will take longer for this business to scale than the Bulls think, and we are 
concerned about profitability in the meantime.


We applaud Morgan Stanley for being the most realistic analyst on the Street in reviewing Carvana:


Morgan Stanley: “4Q18 Review: Focus Shifts to the Potential Need for Capital &
Potential for Insider Selling” – Downgrading To Price Target To $21/share

Analysts Quietly Cut Price Targets On Carvana:
Now A Very Unfavorable Risk/Reward Proposition


Six Carvana analysts have cut their price targets – some in a very material way – since we published our initial 
report. Given the recent irrational move up in Carvana’s share price, there is currently only 15% upside to the 


average analyst price target, their bullish attitude towards the Company and its future notwithstanding.


This represents a weak risk/reward proposition to current and prospective Carvana shareholders.

Spruce Point Sees ~55%-85% Downside In 
CVNA At The Very Minimum, And Potentially 100% 
Downside In An Extreme Bear-Case Scenario


Investors are taking a leap of faith in Carvana’s full year 2019 outlook given that it cannot even provide short-term 
visibility into the business. Nonetheless, taking consensus revenues at face value, and applying a generous 0.5x to 


1.0x multiple, we derive a price target of approximately $7.50 to $19.60 per share.


The largest drivers of our price target change are Carvana’s reduced revenue outlook, significantly diminished 
unrestricted cash, and growing unrecorded tax receivable liability.


We continue to believe that Carvana could be a zero given its significant financing risk.

Spruce Point Sees At Least 50%-70% Downside Risk In 
Carvana (NYSE: CVNA): $9.60 - $16.00 Per Share.
In A Deeper Bear-Case Scenario, CVNA Is A Zero.


At best, Carvana (CVNA or “the Company”) is a used car dealership masquerading as a high-growth tech business. At worst, it’s an uneconomical 
subprime auto loan originator being supported by an unknown party willing to purchase subprime auto loans at vastly off-market rates.


Its rapid growth has been built on smoke and mirrors, and it is inevitable that the force of financial gravity will bring it back to the ground.


Billing itself as the “Amazon of cars,” Carvana sells used vehicles through an e-commerce platform which allows customers to browse its 
inventory, obtain financing, and arrange for delivery / pickup from a home computer or smartphone. Management claims that the inherent 


scalability of its online-oriented model will support EBITDA margins more than twice those of peers – but, in reality, we believe the cost structure 
of the business is little different than that of a typical used auto dealer. Perhaps Carvana’s most unique characteristic as an auto dealer isn’t its e-


commerce orientation, but the fact that it appears to make an attractive profit on the sale of subprime auto loans to financing partners about 
whom management has not been transparent. Without their provision of attractive financing on uneconomical terms, the economics of the 


business would collapse.

13


Spruce Point Sees 50%-70% Downside In CVNA, And 
Up To 100% Downside In An Extreme Scenario


Questionable Accounting And Dubious Sources Of Gross Profit Per Unit (GPU)
• Supporting Profitability With Dubious One-Offs And Other Items: To address high employee turnover without taking a margin hit on higher 


compensation costs, CEO Garcia recently offered equity incentives from his personal holdings to employees who remain at Carvana for over a 
year. However, Carvana excludes these costs from adjusted earnings, though they are paid directly by the company first, and then reimbursed 
by Garcia. Management effectively sees this as a cost to Garcia, not to Carvana, despite the fact that it represents a real cost to the Company if 
it must increase pay to fight overwhelming employee churn. Meanwhile, it adds the “gift” back above the SG&A line, thereby inflating GPU.


• 100% Gross Margin Finance Revenue Driving GPU: Carvana generates an outsized share (~50%) of GPU from 100% gross margin finance and 
insurance (F&I) sales, vs. <20% for KMX. Underlying GPU on car sales alone are >10% below industry average and less than half that of KMX.


• Carvana A Loan Broker?: A questionable refinancing maneuver supported ~7% higher GPU in Q3 FY 18. A similar transaction was completed in 
Dec 18. We question why the unknown party chose to pay Carvana a ~2% “brokerage” fee for a transaction in which it assumed zero risk. 
These gains merit scrutiny and conveniently allowed Carvana to hit its GPU target.


• Questionable Vehicle Service Contract (VSC) Sales Contributing To GPU: Carvana sells extended warranties and GAP waiver insurance, and 
generates income by selling the VSCs to a related party – perhaps at terms favorable to Carvana. We find evidence that Carvana does not 
inspect vehicles to standards to which it is obligated by law, and is not transparent with customers about the terms of its warranties. Liability 
reassignment in the event that consumer protection law violations are proven, could, as a tail risk, wipe out the Company.


Carvana Is An Auto Dealer, Not An Asset-Light Tech Company – And Management Is Forecasting Pie-In-The-Sky Results On Unrealistic Scalability
• A Used Car Dealer, Not A Tech Company: Like any other large-scale used car dealer, Carvana buys used vehicles at auction and through trade-


ins, reconditions them, maintains inventory, manages a logistics network, and arranges financing for customers. This is not an “asset-light,” 
highly-scalable internet business. A close look at its PP&E accounts show more money spent on physical assets than on technology.


• Profitability Targets Are Overly-Ambitious: Carvana is targeting medium-term EBITDA margins >2x those of other auto dealers on a below-
average target Gross Profit Per Unit (GPU). This suggests that management sees tremendous operating leverage in the business, and that it 
expects to achieve SG&A efficiency >50% that of CarMax. Carvana’s business model is simply not sufficiently different from those of other 
auto dealers to support such an advantage in scalability. Any cost savings realized from a leaner on-the-ground sales force and smaller brick-
and-mortar footprint will be offset by higher IT costs, call center costs, and logistics costs. Intense industry competition and lack of 
differentiation will undermine any attempts to achieve a materially above-average GPU, as management expects to achieve in the long-term.


• Carvana Outgrowing Shared Service Agreements With DriveTime: Carvana benefits from its special relationship with DriveTime, its former 
parent, through shared service agreements. As Carvana continues to outgrow its former parent, it will lose the advantage of access to these 
special arrangements which we believe are struck at a discount to market.
14


Spruce Point Agrees With The Short Side 
Consensus, But Sees Even More To The Story


Questionable Uneconomical Financing Provided By Shrouded Financial Backers
• Returns On Loan Sales Make Little Sense Given Credit Risk Distribution Of Borrowers: Carvana is not transparent about the distribution of its 


borrowers’ FICO scores. Based on our market intelligence, we believe management has made statements implying that it receives higher loan 
premiums on its sales of subprime auto loans than it receives on its sales of loans of superior quality to Ally Financial. How can this be? Ally 
recently cut its bulk financing commitment to Carvana, making us concerned that the Company will grow increasingly dependent on non-
transparent borrowers which appear to be engaging in loan transactions at non-market rates.


• Mystery Buyers Supporting Irrational Returns On Subprime Auto Loan Sales: Management does not disclose the identities of the parties which 
appear to be purchasing Carvana’s subprime auto loans at non-market premiums. Yet the trust which appears to be responsible for these 
purchases is becoming an increasingly vital source of financing for Carvana: with Ally beginning to cut back on its direct purchases of Carvana 
receivables, this trust is set to provide financing for more than half of Carvana’s auto loan originations in 2019. We find the profitability of 
Carvana’s auto loan sales perplexing given that peers – notably KMX – typically pay counterparties to assume their subprime auto loans. With 
this trust poised to become a majority backer of Carvana receivables, we call on management to provide more transparency into how the 
trust is financed, and to explain why the Company is capable of realizing vastly off-market prices on the sale of subprime auto loans.


Unfit Management Misrepresenting Its Biographies, Questionable Director And Auditor Independence, And Share Structure Favoring Insiders
• A Dubious History: Carvana was incubated by DriveTime, a subprime used auto dealer whose owner and chief executive, Earnest Garcia II, was 


convicted of felony bank fraud in 1990. The company has been losing money in recent years and replaced Garcia at CEO with Ray Fidel, 
another bank fraud felon convicted in a related case. DriveTime abandoned its IPO dreams in 2010, but set its sites on going public with 
Carvana soon thereafter. Garcia II later installed his son, Ernie Garcia III, as CEO of Carvana. Is Garcia II really the man in charge through super-
voting Class B shares, and using Carvana as means to cash out in a way he couldn’t through a DriveTime IPO? Furthermore, management 
omits from its bios a failed start-up called Looterang (Rewards Systems LLC), material to investors’ ability to assess its history with start-ups.


• Woefully-Lacking Management: No Carvana c-suite executive has prior experience with a public company or in the auto industry (except for 
Garcia III, who worked for his father for a number of years). The CFO was most recently an economics professor, lacks a traditional CFO 
pedigree, and is supported by a treasury professional who filed for ch. 7 bankruptcy. While management’s Stanford and Harvard pedigrees are 
superficially impressive, we prefer seasoned executives with prior auto industry experience for running a levered, money losing enterprise.


• Board Of Directors Lacking Independence: Of the three “independent” directors with prior auto industry experience, two have prior 
connections to DriveTime. Former U.S. Vice President and current board member Dan Quayle is claimed to be independent, but both Garcia II 
and his son have donated to Quayle and Quayle’s son’s political campaigns in the past. This calls his independence into question. Spruce Point 
is wary of companies which grant board seats to well-known and well-connected politicians with limited or no experience in the company’s 
industry (e.g. Theranos, Kior, Waste Management and WorldCom).
15


Spruce Point Sees 50%-70% Downside In CVNA, And 
Up To 100% Downside In An Extreme Scenario


Bull Market Economics: Eternally Bullish Analysts Embrace Carvana As A Tech Business, Not An Auto Dealer


• Tech Analysts Don’t Evaluate The Business Critically Enough: Sell-side firms are inconsistent in their categorization of Carvana: some assign it 
to retail or auto analysts, but some assign it to tech / business services analysts. Tech analysts are less versed in the traditional auto dealer 
business model, and value it more like an asset-light e-commerce stock. Auto analysts tend to be overoptimistic about the stock as well, but 
are demonstrably less bullish on the name. At the end of the day, a spade is a spade, and bull market economics can mask the inevitable 
reality that Carvana is a business burning >$350m per year for only so long…. In the mean time, analysts are adamant that Carvana is a roaring  
“Buy” and see 75% upside to $55.70 per share.


• Carvana Trades Like An Asset-Light Tech Business: Carvana is trading close to 1.5x 2019E EV/Sales on the belief that 83% YoY growth will shrink 
its EBTIDA losses from -$189m to -$86m. Yet, not only are we skeptical of Carvana’s ability to achieve its lofty sales expectations, but we also 
believe that losses will continue and be higher than expected. Carvana’s multiple is greater than that of best-of-breed auto dealer CarMax. It is 
also richer than that of TrueCar, a profitable asset-light auto marketer that assumes neither car inventory risk nor subprime financing risk. 
Carvana should trade at discount to these peers to reflect its higher business risk and its lower quality management and governance. If valued 
at 0.5x to 0.75x NTM revenue, shares in Carvana would be fairly priced at approximately $9.60 to $16.00, implying 50%-70% downside risk.


• Carvana’s Dependence On Financing And Operational Missteps Could Make It A Time Bomb Waiting To Go To Zero: Carvana’s recent practices 
relating to VSC sales and vehicle inspection practices may be in violation of consumer protection laws. Given that Carvana sells finance 
receivables to third-parties with specific representations, Carvana could be forced to repurchase its auto loans. In a worst case scenario, this 
could trigger hundreds of millions of dollars of forced loan repurchases and cause a liquidity crunch. Carvana’s debt is rated at junk levels 
(CCC+, paying 8.875%), which gives it limited financial flexibility to navigate adverse scenarios caused by an economic recession, deficient 
regulatory business practices, or otherwise. The Company’s significant reliance on outside financing to support its loan originations, in 
addition to its significant capital needs as it grows its inventory and logistics footprint, could make it a zero if the credit cycle were to turn, and 
should shareholders fail to backstop further equity raises.


• Corporate Structure And Related-Party Deals Favoring Insiders: Class A shareholders hold just 5% of voting rights in Carvana. Class B 
shareholders control the remainder, with the Garcias’ B shares controlling 90% of voting rights. B shares are fungible into A shares at a rate 
which gives the Garcias 70% economic control over the business. Insiders have been selling, and more than a dozen related-party deals with 
DriveTime and the Garcias could allow management to make out well financially even if Carvana ultimately wipes out shareholders.

Perception Versus Reality:
Where Spruce Point Differs From The Street


Topic Popular View Spruce Point’s View


Business Model
Carvana is the “Amazon of used cars.” It’s a tech business that 


happens to be in the business of selling cars.


Carvana is a used car dealer that, like others in the industry, also focuses on 
online-based sales. It is not an asset-light tech firm, but a car dealer requiring 


significant capital to support growth and loan origination.


Scalability
Carvana doesn’t require the personnel or physical footprint of a 
traditional auto dealer. Its scalability will drive EBITDA margins 


double those of peers.


Carvana’s requires investment in inventory, physical space, and people, just like 
any auto dealer. Any advantages in spending needs for on-site sales force, brick-


and-mortar retail space, etc. will be offset by outsized IT spending and call 
center workforce.


Sustainability and Quality 
of Profit Sources


As good as any auto dealer, and capable of delivering materially
lower car prices and superior service to customers.


No pricing advantage per a recent price study and customer service strains. 
Dependence on questionable high-margin finance-based sources of profit 


(subprime loan originations, refinancing “brokerage”), and deals with associated 
parties at perhaps off-market rates.


Access to Capital Will grow fast enough to justify heavy losses and borrowing. 
CCC+ Junk-rated even during sanguine credit cycle introduces risk of lost access 
to capital if cycle turns. Dependence on uneconomical loan sales for significant 


share of profits – will this be sustainable as Carvana grows?


Blue Chip 
Billionaire Investors


Ernest Garcia II (DriveTime) Tom Dundon (Santander/Carolina 
Hurricanes owner), Mark Walter (Guggenheim CEO)


Who wouldn’t want to follow successful billionaires into an investment?
Unfortunately, some are already cashing out, and in the case of Garcia, he can 
still milk Carvana through related-party deals, while equity holders get wiped 


out.


Executive Team
Hot-shot Stanford and Harvard Ivy Leaguers with histories of 


managing successful tech startups.


Young, inexperienced management with no experience with public companies, 
almost no auto industry experience, and hiding a failed business venture in its 


past. CEO Garcia III appears to have been appointed his by father Garcia II 
(a felonious bank fraudster).


Board of Directors Solid, independent directors with industry experience.
Most board members are not truly independent due to past connections with 


DriveTime. Dan Quayle brings name recognition, but he and his son have 
received political donations from management.


Valuation


Covered in part by sell-side tech analysts that see 75% upside to 
$55.70 per share. 


A high-flying, disruptive tech company deserves a tech-like 
valuation: 3x FY EV/Sales.


Carvana is an auto dealer which should be valued in-line with other auto 
dealers: 0.5x FY EV/Sales and at best 0.75x (note: industry blue chip Carmax is at 


1.3x). In an extreme bear-case scenario, Carvana’s heavy losses, growing debt 
and loan sales dependencies could render it a zero if credit markets dry up.
17


A Well-Known Fundamental Short, But There’s 
More To The Story


Spruce Point acknowledges that Carvana has been cited as a short, mostly for the fundamental challenges facing the Company. 
We also acknowledge that some elements of Carvana’s questionable financing have been identified by the market. However, we find 


new evidence that its subprime auto loan sales are highly uneconomical, yet at the same time more critical to the business’ 
sustainability than is generally recognized. We also shine new light on the tail risks created by its heavy reliance on finance income 


and credit.

Burning Cash With No End In Sight:
When Does The Music Stop On Easy Credit?


Amidst one of the most sanguine credit markets in recent history, Carvana debt is rated CCC+ and pays 8.875%. It has burned 
$350M in cash through the last twelve months ($475m after capex), and has made no material progress towards turning cash flow


positive even as quarterly sales have grown more than 5x since Q4 FY16. Even optimistic sell-side analysts do not expect the 
Company to generate positive cash flow until the early-to-mid 2020s at the earliest. The business also took on another $340M in 


Q3 FY18 on top of its existing $350M floor plan facility (due to expire in 2020) and remaining long-term debt of ~$100M.


With the Company so heavily dependent on financing to support its continued growth, a turn in the credit cycle and growing 
concerns regarding subprime lending could effectively shut Carvana out from credit markets. In an extreme bear-case scenario in 


which Carvana is unable to finance future capital needs, we believe that Carvana would be a zero.


Why does management refer to Carvana as a “tech company”? Maybe because tech companies can get away with generating 
negative earnings and blowing cash as long as the market continues to believe the pie-in-the-sky growth story…


…but unlike nimbler, asset-light software companies, Carvana is a massive used auto dealer and subprime loan origination 
operation with tremendous funding needs. Trying to finance this business’ way to profitability is like trying to turn the Titanic, 


while taking on tremendous risk in the interim.
19


How This Goes To Zero


Spruce Point believes that, with such heavy capital needs, and with so many things that can go wrong, Carvana can be 
deemed a zero without much imagination.


Topic How This Goes To Zero


Dependence On Unknown 
Parties For Profitable Sale Of 
Subprime Auto Loans


• Carvana appears to be selling subprime auto loans at vastly off-market rates to unknown buyers. A 
vital source of profit for the Company may disappear without counterparties’ continued ability and 
willingness to buy loans at unheard-of premiums.


• Should these parties, without a known rationale for supporting Carvana, choose to withdraw their 
support – or lack the capacity to support a larger Carvana – the Company may lack necessary funding 
to persist as a viable business


Dependence On Credit


• If the credit cycle turns, auto loan delinquencies rise, and financing becomes harder to obtain,
Carvana could experience serious funding issues as a CCC+ rated subprime auto dealer


• There is already evidence that Ally is cutting back. Tim Russi, a key supporter of DriveTime/Carvana 
at Ally, recently left the company.


Business Practices Come Under 
Greater Scrutiny


• Consumer protection investigations into Carvana’s inspection and repair practices, or warranty 
transparency (e.g. CFPB already fined DriveTime $8m in 2014)


• Investigation into unlicensed sale of GAP waiver coverage
• Violation of consumer protection or other laws triggers loan reassignment / put-back risk to CVNA
• Associated parties no longer large enough to support growing VSC commissions


Management / Board / 
Employee Turnover


• Departures of Board members deemed “independent” or managers in key roles (e.g. Moorehead –
Director of Finance, Accounting and Tax just quietly left in Oct 2018)


• Employee turnover increases as rank/file demand higher wages and no longer accept stock grants 
from management


Equity Investors Lose Faith


• Investors grow tired of continuing to prop up the stock on the expectation that the Company will 
scale and generate positive profits one day. They balk at backstopping additional cash burn.


• Rotation investor base from momentum / tech investors to more traditional auto investors 
triggers selling
20


Capital Structure And Valuation


Spruce Point believes that Carvana is another absurd technology “growth” story that trades on investors’ perception 
that heavy losses today will translate into magic profits tomorrow, even though after six years since its founding, profits 


and cash flow remain elusive. Now encumbered with $350m of expensive 8.875% CCC+ rated debt, and with loan 
financing partner Ally appearing to distance itself, Carvana investors may start to take repeated earnings 


disappointments more seriously. Anchoring Carvana’s valuation closer to the reality that traditional (money-making) 
auto dealers receive at best 1x and generally 0.50x revenue multiples would result in 50% - 70% downside risk.

Woefully Inexperienced C-Suite


Carvana is emblematic of today’s bull market business environment, where Stanford and Harvard pedigreed individuals with no 
auto industry experience, can manage a public company that burns >$350m per year, yet attain a $5bn enterprise value. CFO 


Mark Jenkins was recently an economics professor, and had no prior public company work experience in finance, accounting, or 
treasury, which are traditional breeding grounds for public company CFOs. He is supported in the treasury function by an 


individual who filed for personal bankruptcy, calling into question his suitability to manage financial affairs for a public company.

Why Do Key Carvana Executives Hide Their 
Past Start-Up Failure At Looterang?


In Spruce Point’s opinion, Carvana’s CEO and CFO have misrepresented their public biographies as stated in SEC filings. We find 
irrefutable evidence that Garcia III and Jenkins co-founded and owned Rewards Systems LLC (dba Looterang). The entity is still 
listed as “Active” according to the Arizona corporate registry.1 Given that Looterang appears to be a failed start-up, it should be 
disclosed and material to investors so that they can accurately judge management’s suitability for running a fledgling enterprise.


Interestingly, Ben Huston, Looterang’s designated CEO, does disclose Looterang in his professional history (unlike Garcia III and 
Jenkins, it was his only professional activity at the time). If Looterang was sufficiently established as a business for Huston to list it 


in his background, why do Garcia III and Jenkins fail to list it in their own?

Carvana: A Brief History


The history of Carvana can be traced to Ugly Duckling, a rental car company based in Tuscon. When the company went bankrupt 
in 1989, Ernest Garcia II – previously convicted of bank fraud – bought up the assets and transformed the business into a used car 
dealer focused on subprime customers, becoming one of the first to engage in loan securitization. The company later rebranded as
DriveTime in 2002 upon going private. Garcia first founded Carvana in 2012 as a captive ecommerce platform for DriveTime’s used 


car sales, but later spun out the Company, installing his son as CEO.


While Carvana presents itself as a tech-forward ecommerce business, it’s important to bear in mind that it is ultimately a used car dealer. Like any other used 
car dealer, it buys vehicles from auction and trade-ins, reconditions them, and maintains significant inventory. Though Carvana’s distribution model is 


somewhat different, the economics of the business are, at their core, the same as any other used car dealer.

Does This Look Like A Tech Company To You?


As much as Carvana bulls wants you to believe that it’s a high-flying, asset-light, highly-scalable “fintech” business, make no 
mistake: this is a used car dealer. The emphasis may be on the online experience, but, like any other dealership, Carvana requires 


significant inventory, a sales force, and a network of physical locations – and a much more involved logistics network to boot.

Nothing Unique About Selling Cars Online


Carvana pitches itself as a “fundamentally better solution to car buying” (Q3 FY 2018 earnings call), as though it were the only 
internet-based platform for buying (used) cars. In our opinion, there is that there is nothing unique about Carvana’s services. 


Countless companies – from large, national e-commerce sites to smaller local dealerships – give consumers the ability to shop for 
cars online (on eerily similar platforms no less). While not all offer Carvana’s full suite of services – from online buying to online 
financing and delivery to the customer’s door – a growing number of dealers do in fact provide everything Carvana has to offer.

We’ve Seen This Movie Before.
It Didn’t End Well.


Just as Carvana was getting off the ground floor in the early 2010s, competitor Beepi was also taking off. While designed as a peer-
to-peer used car marketplace, Beepi gave sellers a guaranteed price for their cars, and purchased their cars if it couldn’t find a 


buyer within 30 days. Accordingly, Beepi, like Carvana, assumed significant inventory risk. Beepi inevitably folded in 2017, 
struggling to find investors to support its high startup costs.1 While Carvana has since achieved much greater scale, Beepi’s fate 


should be taken as a reminder to investors that the economics of used car buying ultimately prevail in Carvana’s business: 
building an online used auto dealer still requires significant investment in inventory, logistics, inspection and repair capabilities, 


and most other areas of cost involved in selling used vehicles.

Being a superficial “tech business” does not insulate Carvana from the harsh economics of the used car industry.

No Price Advantage To Carvana


Carvana claims to cut overhead out of the standard used car dealership cost structure by saving money on salesmen, land, etc.
Does this translate into lower prices to the customer? Our analysis demonstrates that vehicle prices at Carvana are not materially 
lower than CarMax’s used car prices. While the Company previously offered promotional incentives through its referral program, 
giving referrers $100 in cash and referees $500 off a car, it has since swapped out this program for a less-generous offer which


provides the referrer only with credit towards a future car. Carvana’s lower ASP is perhaps attributable to its history of promotional 
activity. However, even with a referral code, there is no discernable or consistent price advantage to shopping through Carvana.

Carvana Is A Used Car Dealership,
Not A Tech Company


Carvana uses carefully-crafted, promotional language to manage its perception among customers and investors. It refers to itself
not as a used car dealer, but as an “eCommerce platform for buying used cars” (see its most recent 10-K). Its physical locations are 


not “dealerships,” but “vending machines.” And, of course, Carvana is “the Amazon of used cars.”


Management’s language is designed to dress up Carvana as an innovative tech company “disrupting” the used car space rather 
than a boring, capital-intensive used car dealer. This marketing has worn off on the investor community: not only do retail investors 


frequently discuss Carvana as a tech company, but the Company is generally covered by sell-side technology analysts at 
investment banks (see later slides). However, at its core, Carvana is little different than any other used car dealer and the economics 


are effectively the same, as we cover through the next several slides.


Why does Carvana get to pitch itself as a high-flying technology business when so many other used car dealers offer the same services?

How Much More Runway Is There For
Market Penetration?


Carvana opened in 41 new markets in FY 18, slightly beating its announced guidance of  30-40 per its Q4 FY 17 shareholder letter. 
But what is the significance of “opening a new market” when Carvana also ships out of market? Carvana defines its markets as the
locations in which it offers free delivery (vs. a shipping fee of roughly $100-$500 for out-of-market delivery, depending on location). 


Yet we note that Carvana appears to charge the same delivery fee to customers within its markets if the car has to be shipped in
from another location, even if reasonably closeby. Carvana also offers to reimburse airfare up to $200 to out-of-market customers 


who fly in to pick up their car at their nearest vending machine.


By defining its market presence as the area within which it offers free delivery – even when in-market deliveries still require a fee in many 
cases, when it still offers delivery outside of its “markets,” and when it reimburses out-of-market customers to fly in – we question the 


significance of “entering a new market” with respect to Carvana’s growth trajectory. We believe that Carvana’s true coverage is effectively 
greater than the numbers cited by management (55.8% of the US population, per its most recent shareholder letter), and therefore that its 


runway for ongoing market penetration is not as robust as characterized by management.

GPU (CVNA Definition)


Investors like Carvana’s apparent tech orientation not just for superficial reasons: the consensus is that Carvana, much like other 
tech companies, is highly scalable. Indeed, Carvana is keen on stressing its operating leverage to investors: because it doesn’t rely 


on brick-and-mortar locations or a traditional sales force, operating margins will supposedly expand rapidly with continued sales 
growth, and should be materially higher than peers once the Company is mature. Specifically, despite a current GPU just 2/3 that of 


CarMax and other new-and-used car dealers, and a targeted “mid-term” GPU 10% below the industry average, management is 
targeting “mid-term” EBITDA margins of 7%-11.5%, versus CarMax’s FY18 EBITDA margin of 8% and the industry average of just 


~4%. Is there really enough leverage built into the business to support this kind of EBITDA margin expansion?


Carvana envisions achieving the highest EBITDA margin of any publicly-listed car dealer – more than doubling the industry average outside of CarMax –
while maintaining an only average-at-best GPU. To reach this level of profitability, the Company would have to demonstrate tremendous leverage.

Apples To Oranges: Carvana Management 
Wants To Have Its Cake And Eat It Too


Part of the driver behind management’s envisioned GPU expansion is its insistence that CarMax is a good comparison case. All-in,
CarMax generates GPU of $3,914 and EBITDA margins of 7.7% as of Q3 FY19, implying significantly higher upside to Carvana 
profitability than the industry average GPU of ~$3,230 and EBITDA margin of ~4%. However, 16% of its all-in GPU is driven by 


income from CarMax Auto Finance (CAF), CarMax’s captive auto finance arm. As Carvana sells 100% of the loans that it originates, it 
wouldn’t be appropriate to compare Carvana GPU or EBITDA to CarMax profitability measures which include the impact of CAF. 


Adjusting company-wide profit for CAF puts CarMax Q3 GPU at $3,281 and EBITDA margins at 4.9%, far more similar to the rest of 
the auto dealer universe. Carvana’s upside should be measured against this standard, not against a standard which includes the 


impact of a business line in which it does not participate.


Adjusting KMX profitability for CAF income, Carvana’s potential upside appears much more modest.

7.7% to 4.9%

Under What Cost Structure Could Carvana 
Possibly Achieve Its Target EBITDA Margins?


With a used retail vehicle GPU of $3,000 on a run-rate used retail vehicle ASP of $20,000, EBITDA margins of 9.3% (the midpoint of 
management’s target mid-term range) would imply SG&A of $1,340 per used retail vehicle ex-depreciation, 47% less than CarMax (ex-
CAF). If, as a more mature business, Carvana’s per-vehicle advertising costs are equivalent to those of CarMax (since this isn’t part of 
the business model’s supposed scalability), all other SG&A per used retail vehicle would stand at $1,121, less than half that of CarMax 


(ex-CAF). In other words, Carvana management is suggesting that, as a more mature business, labor costs, occupancy costs, non-
COGS logistics costs, IT costs, and all other costs will be less than half those of CarMax. How likely is this cost superiority?

Sales Require Customer Service,
Whether On The Ground Or Remote


Management suggests – and bulls assume – that Carvana does not require as large a workforce as a traditional auto dealer, which 
must maintain a relatively dense network of retail locations each staffed with a full roster of salesmen. Yet Carvana must still


maintain a sizable staff of customer service representatives to provide assistance to customers via phone – and this on top of its 
on-the-ground workforce which, while perhaps deemphasized, cannot be eliminated completely. It also requires a much larger IT 
team than do other auto dealers whose online sales channel is limited or nonexistent. While the Company is not yet mature, we


observe that, unless it can grow sales more than twice as fast as it grows its workforce, Carvana will prove to be more labor-
intensive than traditional auto dealers. We do not believe that bulls fully appreciate Carvana’s labor needs, and give it too much 


credit for workforce cost leverage going forward.


Carvana generates only about half the industry average sales per employee, yet its aggregate compensation expense as a percentage of 
sales is over 33% higher than peers, and almost twice that of CarMax.


Carvana would have to double its workforce efficiency just to match CarMax – yet management is communicating that long-term SG&A, of 
which compensation is the most significant expense, will be ~30-60% lower than that of CarMax on a per-vehicle basis.

We also note that reported compensation expense per employee is lower than that of all industry peers except CarMax, as is 
compensation expense per retail unit sold. We question the extent to which Carvana will be able to achieve further compensation 


cost savings on a per-employee and per-unit basis.


While Carvana could perhaps achieve levels of compensation efficiency comparable to CarMax, achieving per-unit compensation costs 30-60% lower than 
CarMax would be extremely challenging.

Online Employee Reviews Confirm Low 
Compensation And High Turnover


Low compensation levels as indicated by Carvana’s filings is confirmed by employee reviews posted online: it appears that 
management is trying to attract talent without offering attractive compensation by creating a “fun” startup-like culture and hiring 


young people with low salary expectations. For a company which requires strong customer service and a talented IT team, we 
worry that growth will be challenged as low salaries encourage high turnover – yet we also note that Carvana has little if any room 


to cut compensation to support EBITDA margins.

Carvana Faces Major Expenses Which Are Unique To 
Its “Employee-Light” Business Model


We observe that “Other Overhead Costs” within Carvana’s SG&A expenses represent over 8% of sales for the Company – more 
than double the corresponding figure of any major auto dealer. Notably, “Other Overhead Costs” include IT expenses, which we 


would expect to be more significant at Carvana than at other dealers which are not as reliant on online sales. As auto ecommerce
becomes increasingly competitive, we expect Carvana to have to continuously reinvest in IT-related R&D to maintain a top-of-the-


line ecommerce platform. This cost bucket will not scale as significantly as bulls assume.


Further, as Carvana brings its logistics in-house and promotes its home delivery service, we are skeptical that non-COGS logistics 
costs will scale more significantly than those of CarMax and other auto dealers. No other major auto dealer breaks out logistics-


related costs as a major item in SG&A – but we don’t expect Carvana’s delivery-based model to scale as well over logistics costs.

Limited Room For Cost Savings Through Focus 
On E-Commerce Over Brick-And-Mortar Model


Part of Carvana’s supposed leverage lies in its limited reliance on brick-and-mortar locations. Yet we note that occupancy costs
generally represent a very small share of SG&A for most auto dealers. We also encourage investors not to ignore the fact that


Carvana must still invest in vending machines, fulfillment centers, and – increasingly – in inspection and reconditioning centers as 
the Company outgrows its shared space with DriveTime. This will ultimately be a source of relative cost savings should Carvana 


reach maturity, but IT costs, centralized personnel costs, and logistics costs could easily offset any possible savings.

KMX: GPU (Ex-CAF)


While aggressively targeting medium-term GPU of $3,000 and EBITDA margins of 7%-11.5%, management is even more ambitious 
in its recently-announced longer-term targets of 15%-19% gross margins (in line with CarMax at 18%-19% when its captive auto 


finance arm is included) and 8%-13.5% EBITDA margins (exceeding CarMax at 7.7% when its captive auto finance arm is included). 
We find management’s long-term targets just as unrealistic as their medium-term targets: used vehicle ASPs, GPUs, and gross 


margins have been remarkably steady through the past several years, and there is no reason to believe that Carvana can beat its 
competitors on gross profitability by as much as five percentage points on sales of what are ultimately undifferentiated products.


Steady ASPs and general 
industry competitiveness limit 


opportunities for used car 
dealers to expand gross margins


Carvana unlikely to achieve long-
term gross margin target given 
industry competitiveness and 


historical margin stability


November 2018 Investor Day Presentation
How meaningful are long-term 


“targets” with such a wide range?


These aren’t true “targets” so much 
as they are pie-in-the-sky aspirations

“We’ll Do Subprime Loan Origination Better 
Than Everyone Else!”


We know that Carvana expects to achieve such high EBITDA margins on its perceived operating leverage. But how does it expect to 
achieve gross margins in line with CarMax’s all-in gross margin (including CAF) without a captive auto finance arm of its own? 
Management says that they have a “unique finance platform” which “allows us to, while not taking credit risk, monetize finance 


originations across the entire credit spectrum, not just to the top end of the credit spectrum.” Translation: “We do subprime loan 
origination just like everyone else – we’ll just be more profitable on it.” Why? (Maybe if a closely-associated party is willing to help 


out…)


“Great. And maybe just kind of very high level here, during the road show you 
had kind of guided to 7% to 11.5% EBITDA margins and CarMax probably your 
closest competitor is around 7.8% last year. And if we kind of look at what you 
are thinking about in terms of GPUs for total you had about 3,000 versus them 
maybe close to 4,000 and that's just coming from the SG&A difference that you 
are applying to gross profit.


So, without opening a capital finance company you are running your own 
auctions, how do you kind of think about getting to the midpoint or the 
higher end of your long-term EBITDA guidance?”
- Mike Levin, Deutsche Bank


“So I think it's a reasonable question to ask kind of what's the gap there, that gap 
part of that is made up by pricing differences. I think that's really the majority of 
the gap and our long-term plan…. I think somewhere where we think we 
debatably can do better is in financing. While they do have a captive finance 
company and that enables kind of monetizing finance receivables in a more 
complete way on those receivables that you keep. We built a pretty unique 
finance platform that allows us to while not taking credit risk monetize 
finance originations across the entire credit spectrum not just to the top 
end of the credit spectrum, while passing that credit risk on to third parties.
And we believe overtime that could end up being more efficient across some of 
all customers. So roughly that gives you a sense of kind of the different pieces, 
and I don't think we're going to break them down further than that.”

Carvana’s Contribution To Corporate Finance 
Lexicon: “Ex-Gift”


Spruce Point is often amused by the creative ways in which management teams adjust earnings to inflate company profitability.
Carvana has given us a new one: “ex-gift.”


In Q3 FY18, to commemorate Carvana’s 100,000th vehicle sold, CEO Ernie Garcia III announced that he would grant all current 
employees 165 CVNA shares from his personal holdings upon their one-year employment anniversaries. For tax purposes, these 


“gifts” will be structured as stock grants (thereby counting against taxable GAAP earnings) to be offset by matching contributions 
of stock from Garcia to the Company. Of course, management believes that this does not represent a “real” cost to the Company, 
since the gift is ultimately coming out of Garcia’s pocket. However, with management struggling to keep turnover under control


and incapable of generating profits, we interpret this “gift” as a clever incentive designed to preserve a reasonable level of 
employee loyalty, and minimize additional cash outlay for wages. However, if Carvana is incapable of continuing to prop-up its 


stock, employees may be less welling to accept this type of equity compensation in the future.


Interestingly, management appears to treat the 
“gift” as a component of COGS (and 


capitalizes some costs in inventory) rather 
than as part of compensation expense in 


SG&A, thereby inflating GPU by adjusting for it


If Carvana needs to pay employees a one-year bonus to encourage employee loyalty, reduce turnover and as a substitute for cash, why 
should this be excluded from Company expenses?

Carvana Outgrowing DriveTime:
Can No Longer Rely On Special Relationship


Through its special relationship with DriveTime, Carvana has benefitted from shared facilities and special lease agreements for 
inspection and reconditioning center (IRC) use, among other things. We expect costs to increase as Carvana is forced to enter into 
agreements with unrelated third parties for new facilities. While its IRC costs to DriveTime are based on “its pro rata utilization of 


space at each facility plus a pro rata share of each facility’s actual insurance costs and real estate taxes,” we expect that other 
overhead will increase Carvana’s facility costs – and, importantly, that increasing pressure to expand its footprint will magnify its 


capital needs. Fewer opportunities to share costs with DriveTime will render Carvana less scalable as it grows.


Approximately 35% of existing future operating lease expenses through 2022 are through its related-party agreement with DriveTime. As the 
share of third-party leases increases, opportunities for cost-sharing, or for understating costs through DriveTime, will decline.

Questionable Benefits From Special 
Relationship With DriveTime


Some of Carvana’s past activities with DriveTime are particularly concerning to us. During Q3 FY 2018, Carvana paid DriveTime
$200,000 for flights on aircraft operated by DriveTime. Why is Carvana management flying around on DriveTime’s plane?


Carvana has also received several short-term loans from parties related to DriveTime. The Company entered into a $50M facility 
with Verde – a DriveTime affiliate run by a former Garcia II associate and DriveTime executive, and in which Garcia II has financial 
interests – in February 2017. It drew down $20M on the facility in that quarter before returning the money. Carvana also took out a 


brief $10M loan from Garcia II himself in 2016. Again, as Carvana outgrows DriveTime, it will not be able to rely on its former parent 
for substantive financial help – and we wonder if it should have relied on DriveTime for this kind of help in the first place.

Poor Reconditioning Practices And Lack Of 
Disclosure Regarding Vehicle Condition


We find countless reports of Carvana vehicles being delivered in poor condition. While many of these are complaints about the
cosmetic state of the car, we also find a sizable quantity of more serious claims regarding the condition of delivered cars. In many 


cases, Carvana has delivered vehicles in dangerously poor condition, and has hidden the fact that a vehicle has been in an 
accident. Note that, depending on the state, failing to disclose that a used vehicle has been in an accident constitutes dealer fraud.

Reviews on Carvana’s own website are, of course, stellar. The story is much different on sites not overseen by the Company.

Declining Reconditioning Practices As The 
Company Pushes To Satisfy The Street


Third-party reports suggest that, while Carvana used to be more diligent about conducting vehicle inspections, the Company has 
grown increasingly careless since it went public, and as it has gradually outgrown DriveTime’s capacity for inspections and 


reconditioning. With management now incentivized to keep numbers up to paint a rosy picture for investors, this comes as no 
surprise to us. Reports of declining inspection standards and vehicle quality are corroborated by Yelp trends.

A Higher Regulatory Standard?


Section 5 of the Fair Trade Commission Act (“FTC Act”) outlaws “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.”1
Is Carvana in violation of the FTC Act for failing to disclose the condition of its vehicles completely and accurately to customers?


We believe that Carvana should be held to a higher standard than are other car dealers with respect to FTC Act compliance, as
Carvana’s customers cannot inspect the state of a vehicle before making a purchase decision. While Carvana does give customers 
a seven-day window for returns, symptoms of undisclosed problems with a vehicle may not express themselves until later. Further,


with buyers already having secured financing, released a down payment, and completed the purchase process prior to receiving 
the car, many customers would likely prefer to avoid the hassle of returning the car and restarting the car shopping process.

By failing to conduct thorough inspections before selling its vehicles, and then covering any servicing conducted by third parties during the 
seven-day trial period through SilverRock – Ernest Garcia’s auto insurance company – the Garcias could be, in effect, shifting pre-sale 


inspection and reconditioning costs from Carvana to another family-owned entity, thereby inflating Carvana earnings.


Note that, since Ernest Garcia II holds such a large stake in Carvana, whether he absorbs these costs through Carvana or SilverRock makes little 
economic difference to him. He would probably rather absorb the costs through SilverRock to improve Carvana’s numbers and encourage 


public investment in the stock.


Source
Odd that even SilverRock –Ernest Garcia’s non-public 


auto insurance company – describes itself as a 
“disruptive” and “innovative” “tech business”…


Carvana ties up the customer in the purchase process 
before giving him a chance to inspect his vehicle, making it 


more costly for the customer to shop elsewhere if he is 
ultimately unsatisfied with his car.

Offloading Inspection And Reconditioning 
Costs To DriveTime/SilverRock?


While Carvana sells separate extended warranty plans which are ultimately sold to SilverRock for a fee, it covers all customers 
under its limited warranty, which covers “certain broken or defective components” over 100 days or 4,189 miles.1 Liabilities 
associated with this coverage fall on Carvana rather than SilverRock. However, we know that SilverRock also administers 


Carvana’s limited warranty1, and that repair costs are first charged to SilverRock. As SilverRock is a related party, are we confident 
that Carvana is being charged a fair price for SilverRock’s coverage of its limited warranty? If Carvana is increasingly negligent in 
its inspection and reconditioning practices, do corrective service charges ordered under the limited warranty constitute effective 


reconditioning charges which are shifted from Carvana to SilverRock, for which Carvana may never be charged a fair price? 
If so, can this practice persist as Carvana continues to outgrow DriveTime/SilverRock?

Carvana: VSC Revenue per Retail Vehicle Sold


Carvana Getting Increasingly Favorable 
Commissions On Related-Party VSC Sales?


Dating back to FY15, Carvana consistently generated about $250 in VSC-related sales per used retail vehicle sold. However, this 
number has grown rapidly since H2 FY17 at a compounded quarterly growth rate (CQGR) of 14%, and now stands at $390 – almost 
double where it stood in Q2 FY17. We note that this growth began not long after Carvana entered into a master dealer agreement 
dated December 9, 2016 under which it agreed to sell its VSCs to DriveTime (to be administered by SilverRock) (see FY17 10-K).


Like revenue from loan sales, VSC-related revenue carries 100% gross margins. Assuming a baseline level of VSC-related revenue 
per car of $250 for Carvana, the recent growth of this figure to $548 boosted Q3 FY18 GPU by 6.5%. At $250 of VSC-related revenue 


per car, Q3 GPU (Ex-Gift) would have been just $2,163 versus $2,303 reported GPU (Ex-Gift). Is this a legitimate source of gross 
profit for Carvana, considering that it is generated from related-party transactions?


VSC-related 
revenue per used 
retail vehicle sold 
for Carvana was 
steady at around 
$250 since FY15.


Why did this figure 
nearly double 


between Q2 FY17 
and Q3 FY18?

increase in 


Carvana’s VSC-

Growth In VSC Income Per Vehicle At Best A 
Reflection Of Questionably Aggressive Practices


The observed growth in VSC income per car, if not attributable to changing VSC sale price arrangements between Carvana and 
DriveTime, could perhaps be attributable to rising attach rates: more customers may be signing up for CarvanaCare. In fact, former 


employees with whom we spoke noted that, at some point over the last two years, Carvana changed its online sales process to 
make the extended warranty a default option at checkout – and that, as a consequence, the Company received frequent complaints 


from customers who had unintentionally and unknowingly purchased an extended warranty or GAP coverage. Others have 
suggested that customers would be charged a higher price on their vehicle if they opted out of the warranty. If this is in fact the 


source of Carvana’s rising VSC income per car, we believe that it may be a reflection of aggressive business practices which run
afoul of FTC guidelines.


Source


So is the growth in VSC income per vehicle to increasingly favorable pricing agreements between Carvana and DriveTime, or aggressive 
warranty sales practices? We find both explanations worrisome.

Is Carvana Violating FTC Guidance In Failing To 
Provide Terms And Conditions?


Carvana appears not to be up-front about the details of its VSCs with customers. Spruce Point made multiple attempts to obtain 
CarvanaCare terms and conditions in the course of our research. In all but one instance, we were either instructed to proceed with 
the purchase process (during which we would supposedly be presented with the terms), directed to the terms of Carvana’s limited 


warranty (which we were incorrectly told were identical to CarvanaCare’s terms), or given a list of items covered under CarvanaCare 
(but not the formal terms and conditions themselves). In the one instance in which we were provided with formal terms and 


conditions, we were given the document only after first being directed to information on the limited warranty. A less inquisitive 
shopper would have taken the sales assistant’s word that it was identical to CarvanaCare’s terms and conditions.


Per FTC guidance, disclosures like these “should be provided before the consumer makes the decision to buy, e.g., before clicking 
on an ‘order now’ button or a link that says: ‘add to shopping cart.’”1 Yet Carvana does not make its extended warranty terms openly 


available on its website to customers before they select a car – nor are they available at the effective point of purchase.


1. .com Disclosures: How to Make Effective Disclosures in Digital Advertising (FTC)


Carvana Checkout Page – Extended Warranty Selection “Here’s what’s covered” Popup


During the point of the checkout process at which the customer is asked to select a warranty plan, clicking “Here’s what’s covered” generates a 
small, uninformative popup message describing CarvanaCare’s coverage in extremely general terms. The “Here’s what’s covered” link on this 
popup directs the customer to a list of items covered under the extended warranty plan. Nowhere at this stage of the checkout process – the 


effective point of purchase for the warranty plan – are the formal terms and conditions made available to the customer.

Stringent Restrictions Reduce Likelihood Of 
Warranty Claims On CarvanaCare


We find a number of CarvanaCare’s terms to be particularly strict and out-of-line with industry standards. For example, Carvana 
requires that customers get an oil change every six months or 5,000 miles, which is more frequent than is required by many vehicle 


manufacturers as per their own owner’s manuals. A customer who failed to read comprehensively through CarvanaCare’s terms 
and conditions (which, again, are not liberally provided to the customer during the purchase process), yet who diligently adhered 
to manufacturer maintenance guidelines, may still run afoul of CarvanaCare maintenance requirements. Other auto dealers, such


as AutoNation, instead require that customers adhere to the maintenance guidelines set out by the vehicle manufacturer. We 
believe that CarvanaCare maintenance requirements are unusually and unnecessarily strict – an offense made more malicious by 
the fact that Carvana does not openly provide CarvanaCare terms and conditions on its website or during the purchase process.

Carvana improperly gives customers the impression that 
CarvanaCare’s terms are similar to those of manufacturer 


warranties, when in fact they are more strict…


…yet Carvana also does not thoroughly inspect and recondition 
its used vehicles. Why does Carvana get to impose more rigorous 
maintenance standards on the customer while giving itself a pass?

Undisclosed Gaps In GAP Coverage Suggests 
Aggressive VSC Sales


Carvana offers GAP waiver coverage in addition to its extended warranty. What the Company doesn’t tell you is that it is licensed 
to provide GAP coverage in only 14 states (as of Sept 2018). We have found numerous instances of customers purchasing GAP 


coverage from Carvana only to find out later, whether through independent research or reading the post-sale fine print, that 
Carvana is not licensed to sell GAP coverage in their respective states. We are highly confident that Carvana has illegally sold GAP 


coverage to countless more customers in non-qualifying states, as it says nothing about state-by-state restrictions on its 
protection plan website. It appears that Carvana is doing all that it can to maximize its 100% gross margin VSC revenue.

Why were these customers offered GAP coverage in the first place?


Shouldn’t Carvana’s system have known that they were in states in which it doesn’t offer GAP coverage?


Is Carvana just hoping that customers don’t do their homework and end up buying GAP coverage anyways?


What happens when a Carvana customer who purchased illegally-sold GAP coverage ends up putting in a claim?


Charging more to customers who do not elect GAP coverage to make up for 
loss of 100% gross margin revenue?

Aggressive Sales Practices Generate Lucrative 
Service Revenue From Unknowing Customers


Violating state or federal law regarding the sale of extended vehicle warranties or GAP waiver coverage could expose Carvana to 
serious loan reassignment risk, which could cripple the Company given its strained financial situation. Failing to conduct sufficient 
vehicle inspections, recondition vehicles as needed, and disclose the state of the vehicle to the buyer would also likely run afoul of 


state or federal law, amplifying this risk.


We encourage Carvana’s financing partners – including Ally and all other involved parties – to investigate these matters before 
conducting further business with Carvana.


CVNA FY 2017 10-K


As Carvana has already been forced to repurchase receivables in the past for misrepresenting them to buyers, we do not take this risk lightly.


We believe that the Company’s apparent misrepresentations of the status of its vehicles to customers, in addition to its aggressive VSC sales 
practices, may violate state or federal law and thus precipitate significant loan reassignments.

Lack Of Transparency Regarding Related-Party 
F&I Income


On its FY 17 income statement in both its FY 17 10-K and its S-1 filed on April 23, 2018, Carvana reports that it realized $8.9M in 
related-party “other sales” in FY 17. On page 92 of its 10-K and page F-22 of its S-1, we see that this $8.9M represents commissions 


received on VSCs sold to SilverRock (DriveTime) “and administered by DriveTime.” However, on page 144 of the 2018 S-1, the 
Company reports that it received $10.5M in “VSC sales pursuant to the master dealer agreement” – e.g. revenue from VSCs sold to 


SilverRock. Was this extra $1.6M associated with GAP coverage administered by SilverRock, which was not discussed in the 
former disclosures? Is it not recognized as revenue for some reason? Regardless, it is not clear why this $1.6M is not included in 


“other sales from related parties” disclosed on the income statement. We also observe inconsistencies in this disclosure for FY 16.


At best, this reflects poor governance and controls at Carvana. At worst, the Company is attempting to hide the extent to which its 
high-margin F&I income is tied to related parties.

VSC-Related Sales Really 100% Gross Margin?


Industry standards dictate that revenue associated with the sale of VSC contracts be recognized as 100% gross margin revenue.
However, Carvana notes that DriveTime / SilverRock received $6.5M and $0.1M in FY 17 and FY 16, respectively, “pursuant to the 
master dealer agreement for VSCs sold to our customers and for administering GAP waiver coverage.” CarMax also reports VSC 
revenue as bearing 100% gross margins, but does not report any similar payments to the administrators of its warranties or GAP 
insurance products. Is this something that CarMax simply doesn’t report, or do they not similarly reimburse its VSC partners for


administering its warranties? If Carvana is paying SilverRock to administer its VSCs, should its VSC-related sales really be a 100% 
gross margin revenue stream?


Subtracting this $6.5M payment from Carvana’s FY 17 gross revenue would cut FY 17 GPU by 10%, from $1,539 to $1,392.

CY18 Q3 Retail Used Car GPU (Excluding Gains on Loans and VSC Sales)


Used Car GPU Average


Carvana GPU Relatively Low When Gain On 
Loan Sales Are Excluded


Looking more closely at the components of GPU, we observe that gross income from the sale of loans accounts for approximately
half of Carvana’s per unit gross profit. Although loan sales account for just ~5% of Carvana revenue as of Q3 FY 18, these sales


carry gross margins of 100%, and therefore contribute significantly to overall GPU. Carvana’s GPU for retail used cars, ignoring the 
contribution of loan and VSC-related income, is just $1,127 – among the lowest of any major auto dealer.


While bulls may see this as an opportunity for Carvana to expand gross margins, we note that scale will have little if any impact on GPU, which 
therefore will not necessarily grow significantly as the Company expands.


We wonder why Carvana cannot support more competitive GPUs after 5+ years in operation, and having benefitted from the guidance and scale 
of an experienced used car dealer in its early days. If Carvana generates substandard GPUs today, why should we expect this to be any different 


going forward?

While CarMax also sees its high-margin “Other” sales contribute an outsized share of GPU, Carvana is materially more dependent on this 
revenue stream for its gross profits. We take this as a negative sign for the health of Carvana: finance companies which generate income from 


loan sales are generally low-multiple businesses. This also renders Carvana more dependent on the availability of financing.


While finance and insurance (F&I) income drives ~50% of Carvana GPU, less than 20% of CarMax’s GPU (Ex-CAF) is attributable to 
F&I. Not only do we see limited upside in the non-F&I component of Carvana’s GPU, but we wonder why Carvana, as a largely-


subprime auto dealer, is able to generate such significant F&I income on a per-vehicle basis.
62


Reporting Two Businesses With Different 
Economics As A Single Segment


Note that, despite the fact that its loan sales are such significant drivers of gross profit, management claims to believe that it is 
appropriate for the business to operate in one reportable segment, whereas CarMax segregates its auto finance business into 


a separate segment (though it also operates a captive finance company). We believe that Carvana should do the same, and that 
this would provide greater transparency into its questionable auto finance-related activities.


Are we really to believe that Carvana operates just one business, 
and that originating/selling subprime auto loans is not economically different from auto sales?


CarMax reporting of two distinct segments seems more appropriate

Carvana’s Business Model:
Not Just Selling Cars, But Originating Loans


Carvana sells its receivables to third parties after originating auto loans associated with its vehicle sales. The availability of 
financing is vital to Carvana – not just because loan sales support a significant share of its gross profits, but because these 


sales help to finance its purchases of used cars at auction – and, thus, its inventory build – as it continues to grow.


Carvana’s sales of receivables to third parties are then recorded as a “gain on loan sales.”


We believe Ally Financial purchases ~65% of Carvana’s loans, with other parties purchasing the remainder (see subsequent slides).

What Kind Of Returns Does Carvana Generate 
On Its Loan Sales?


Carvana does not explicitly discuss its return on loan sales. However, we can deduce its returns from the Company’s financial
statements. Carvana’s cash flow statement includes its gain on loan sales, which represents the dollar amount of its gains on the 
sale of auto loans originated. Also included in the cash flow statement is “proceeds from the sale of finance receivables,” which 


represents the total dollar amount which the Company received for selling receivables, gains on loan sales included. By deducting 
gains on loan sales from proceeds from the sale of receivables, we can determine the notional dollar value of loans underwritten by 


Carvana in a given period, and can use this as a basis on which to determine the return that it realizes on loan sales.

What Do These Loans Look Like, And Who Is 
Buying Them? Management Reluctant To Say


Note that, when first asked about the buyers and the makeup of the loans in Q1 FY 2017, management effectively evaded the 
question, responding that the FICO score distribution of its financing customers “look a lot like the broader used car market” while 


providing no real detail on the makeup of its base of borrowers. We find this level of evasiveness in response to such a vital 
question highly questionable.


“Yeah. Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you help me out 
on what's the average FICO score of your buyers that are using 
financing on your site? And how has that trended as you've doubled 
since IPO, or actually call it massively more than doubled? Also, can you 
– it doesn't look like Ally is now taking all of your loans based on my 
calculations, are you selling to others now as well? And if so, who and 
what type of loans are you selling to other people than Ally?”


- Nat Schindler, Bank of America


“Yeah. So first on the FICO question, I would say our FICO continues 
to look a lot like the broader used car market. So if you look at other 
leading retailers or just kind of used car sales in general, we've got 
a very similar FICO distribution to any of those retailers and that's 
been very stable across time, nothing to call out there. Obviously Ally 
is buying many of our loans and then they're also providing financing to 
other buyers that we're then able to refinance through these refinancing 
transactions. That I would say is in concept somewhat similar to the way 
securitization market kind of works, and we'll probably continue to 
develop more of those financial buyers over time. And those are some of 
the structural changes that we're talking about that we believe we'll have 
access to over the next several quarters we continue to bring more 
people in. But Ally remains our biggest partner by a long way.”

Questionable Subprime Lending Math


In its recent investor day presentation, management provided slightly more detail, providing a stylized graph representing the 
credit distribution of customers who finance through Carvana. Though the graph does not offer rigorous detail, it does show that


subprime borrowers are relatively over-represented among Carvana’s customer base.


Based on our market intelligence, we believe the weighted average FICO score of customers borrowing through Carvana is 
approximately 630-640. Yet, during a recent investor conference, Ally claimed that its used auto loans have an average FICO score 


of 680. We understand that Ally purchases ~65% of Carvana’s loans at ~102 par. Given that it buys loans with an average FICO 
score of 680, the remaining loans purchased by the other buyer must have an average FICO score of ~550 – and, for Carvana to 


report loan sales at 104 par, the buyer must be paying more than Ally pays for superior loans!


November 2018 Investor Day Presentation


“So if you look at our used business, the FICO on our used business 
which represents about 52%, 53% of all the business that we originate 
today is coming on at an average FICO of 680. Our new business is 
coming on an average FICO of 700. So it's very steady across the 
board. You don't see big barbells in our portfolio, which again gives us 
confidence when the environment does turn.”

Famous Last Words: “Trust Us”


How does Carvana get such good terms on subprime loans? Management says the secret is in its model: while all other 
transactions in the automotive securitization market show a close, consistent relationship between FICO score and expected 


cumulative loss, Carvana just happens to offer better-performing loans at each weighted average FICO score. Of course, 
management provides no evidence or data to back this up – just another stylized graph (lacking units or scale) representing 


“historical and current best estimates of future performance for all loans originated on Carvana’s website.”

line of the individual transactions in the chart.

Carvana Gains On Subprime Auto Sales:
Remarkably Different From Market Standards


It is worth emphasizing just how widely these returns on subprime auto loan sales would vary from peer standards. Consider the 
economics of CarMax’s auto lending. Of customers who finance directly through CarMax, CarMax finances most prime borrowers 
(average FICO score of 680+) directly through its captive finance arm, CarMax Auto Finance (CAF). Customers with FICO scores 
averaging 620-680 are financed by third-parties called “Tier 2” providers. These providers either pay a relatively small fee ($200-


$300) for the right to originate these loans, or pay no fee. Meanwhile, CarMax pays a fee to parties which finance its subprime 
customers (average FICO below 620). These are called “Tier 3” providers.


If CarMax would rather pay other parties to originate loans for its subprime customers than engage in subprime auto loan 
origination itself, how does Carvana manage to turn a handsome profit on subprime auto loans?

According to Carvana’s 2017 S-1, DriveTime purchased all of Carvana’s auto loan receivables (at par) from the beginning of 2013 
through the end of 2015. Carvana therefore generated no gains or losses from loan sales through the end of 2015. Carvana 


originated a total of $24M of receivables in FY14 and $80M of receivables in FY15.

Starting in January 2016, Carvana sold its auto finance receivables to “certain trusts” serviced by DriveTime. The trusts, in turn, 
issued notes to Delaware Life Insurance Company (“Delaware Life”), an insurer controlled by Mark Walter. As a >5% shareholder in


Carvana, Walter – who indirectly controls CVAN Holdings, LLC, which in turn owns ~9% of Carvana – was disclosed as the note 
purchaser in Carvana’s SEC filings.

Who Purchases Carvana’s Loans Now?
2016-18: Ally And “Certain Third Party Purchasers”


In Dec 2016, Carvana announced an agreement with Ally under which Ally would provide up to $375M in financing for Carvana’s auto
loans. In a concurrent agreement, Carvana secured another $292.2M of financing from “certain third party purchasers.” Ally 


subsequently committed up to $1.5B in financing capacity for 2018, but has since cut back its lending capacity to $1.25B for 2019. 
We note that, interestingly, this decision came just as Ally’s auto finance president and DriveTime/Carvana supporter Tim Russi 


resigned from Ally in April 2018, shortly after DriveTime’s losses reportedly surged.1

The Third-Party Purchaser:
“Sonoran Auto Receivables Trust”


According to the Master Transfer Agreement, the “third-party purchaser” – the trust to which Carvana sells its receivables – is now 
called “Sonoran Auto Receivables Trust” (“Sonoran”). As discussed, with Ally the only other party currently purchasing Carvana 


loans, we deduce that Sonoran is buying the Company’s subprime loans at a premium.


Note that, according to management’s recent “Explainer on Recent Refinancing Transactions,” Sonoran is funded both by Ally and 
“non-Ally parties.” However, management is reluctant to discuss the source of the non-Ally funding behind the trust.

Carvana Funding Structure,
December 2016 To Present


Carvana is clearly hugely dependent on Ally for financing. But it is also dependent on the equity holders in Sonoran Auto 
Receivables Trust, which purchases Carvana’s subprime auto loans.


Who are the “non-Ally parties” behind Sonoran who seem willing to pay a premium for subprime loans? And why is management 
so reluctant to share this information despite questioning from investors?

Is Ally Aware Of Carvana’s Subprime 
Economics?


As another major financial backer of Carvana’s lending business, one might expect that Ally would be aware of the close ties 
between Carvana and its other financial backers, as well as the suspicious economics of its subprime auto lending. However, 


the relationship between Carvana and Ally was until recently managed by Tim Russi, who, as President of Auto Finance at Ally,
also managed the lender’s relationship with DriveTime and provided financing to the company even as it suffered growing 


losses. Russi has since departed Ally as of April 2018.


Does the recent reduction in Ally’s financial commitment to Carvana suggest that its new auto finance team is applying greater 
scrutiny to its relationship with the Company? Is the new team as comfortable with Carvana’s subprime auto lending as was 


Russi and his team?

Sonoran Providing Financing Just As Carvana 
Needed It Most


Notably, Sonoran increased its funding capacity to $1.4B in Q3 – just as Ally cut its bulk financing capacity (excluding its 
financing of Sonoran of $350M) from $1.5B to $1.25B, and cut its early termination option from 180 days to 90 days. With this, 


Sonoran is set to surpass Ally as Carvana’s largest lender.

Capital Needs Will Become More Dire If 
Carvana Continues To Grow As Analysts Expect


Under current loan commitments and projected financing needs given consensus sales growth estimates, Carvana will exceed 
its current borrowing capacity by ~$1B by FY 2020. This deficit would increase to $2.5B in FY 2021. Just as Carvana’s historical


lenders are being replaced by an obscure trust backed by non-disclosed entities, Carvana’s capital needs are intensifying 
rapidly. We are concerned about management’s ability to continue to obtain financing as it continues to grow the business. 
Why would future lenders be willing to finance subprime auto loans on terms similar to what Carvana has gotten thus far?

Finding New Ways To Milk Profits From Loans: 
Odd Gain From Refinancing Agreement


Q3 With Gain on Loan 
Sale, and Ex-Gift:


$2,303


In Q3 FY 2018, management realized a $4M gain from “facilitating the refinancing of a $236M pool of Carvana-originated finance 
receivables that we had previously sold.” As part of Carvana’s finance-related sales, this revenue carried a 100% gross profit 


margin and flowed directly into GPU, boosting GPU by 7%. In a follow-up note, management described this transaction as 
facilitating the refinancing of loans originated and sold by Carvana into “fixed pools” rather than “forward flow commitments,” 


which are supposedly given less-favorable treatment by ratings agencies and support lower rates of return for investors. All told, 
Carvana generated a riskless ~2% return on a transaction which appears entirely outside the purview of its business. 


The justification for this transaction seems questionable to us.


Without this refinancing income and without excluding the gift expense, management would have missed GPU guidance of $2,300 by ~10%, 
and GPU would have contracted sequentially. Further assuming VSC-related revenue per used retail vehicle sold of $250 (recall our earlier 


discussion), GPU would have been a full 15% lower, at $1,965. Instead, management hit its $2,300 GPU guidance almost perfectly.

Questionable Justification For “Monetization 
Of Finance Receivables”


In its follow-up note, management claimed that it was “uniquely positioned” to conduct this refinancing as the originator of these 
loans, since “financial institutions who fund consumer auto loans typically do a substantial amount of due diligence on loan pools 
and their originators before funding.” However, we believe that another financial institution would have been able to conduct this 


riskless transaction for a lower fee. Why was this transaction conducted by Carvana for a ~2% fee instead?


Further, in its Q3 FY18 10-Q, management states explicitly that the Company does not have the right to “purchase or sell finance
receivables it has previously sold under the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement.” Why was Carvana able to conduct a transaction 


which its financial statements appear to prohibit in clear and unambiguous terms?


Is this enough to justify a riskless 2% fee?

How Much More “Monetization Of Finance 
Receivables” Can Carvana Support?


Carvana completed a similar transaction on December 28, 2018: this time receiving a $2.3M fee for refinancing $134M of loans –
good for another ~1.6% riskless return. Carvana has now facilitated the refinancing of $387.4M of loans out of aggregate principal 
balances of $478.8M sold as of Q3 FY18. This leaves remaining principal balances yet to be refinanced of just $91.3M, which would 


support just $1.5M more in refinancing fees – good for an incremental $55 of GPU ON 27,500 retail units sold, or about 2.5% of 
Carvana’s pre-monetization GPU in Q3, versus 7% in Q3 FY18. While Carvana will presumably try to conduct similar refinancings 


on future loans originated, management now has a far smaller reserve from which to create profits from the monetization of 
receivables, and with which to make up any shortfalls in GPU.

Management Refuses To Reveal Identity Of 
Uneconomical Buyers Despite Investor Questioning


Given the puzzling economics of Carvana’s subprime auto loan sales and its heavy dependence on these sales for gross profit, we 
believe that management should be more transparent about the identity of the new trust’s lender: who would realistically be willing 


to pay a premium for subprime auto loans? Indeed, investors appear to have asking about its identity since the refinancing was 
first announced. Yet management continues to be coy about the trust’s source of funding.

Carvana Recap: Can Carvana’s Uneconomical Loan 
Selling Arrangements Persist As It Grows 
Increasingly Dependent On New Financing?


After taking such an exhaustive view of Carvana’s funding situation, it’s worth taking a step back to understand the significance of 
all of this detail. Carvana is currently burning hundreds of millions in cash and hugely dependent on third-party funding to finance 
its growth. Until now, Ally has been the primary provider of third-party financing for Carvana, but it has likely primarily absorbed 
Carvana’s highest-FICO loans. Meanwhile, the Company appears to be realizing vastly off-market returns on its sale of subprime 


auto loans to its other financial backers – yet management won’t reveal their identities, leaving us wondering whether this funding 
is sustainable. Perhaps they are wagering that the company can achieve self-sustaining profitability before capital runs dry – but, 


with Ally now beginning to reduce its funding, we believe that Carvana’s heavy dependence on irrational third-party financing 
could catch up with it before it can turn a sustainable profit. Any of the concerns which we illustrate in this report – the Company 


running afoul of consumer protection laws, issuing GAP waiver coverage in states in which it is not authorized to do so, etc. –
could also cause capital providers to flee preemptively, creating a cash crunch which could ultimately sink Carvana.

Will the credit cycle turn for the worse between now and then, which could make capital extremely hard to come by for a junk-rated 
borrower like Carvana?


Will evidence of concerning behavior by the Company cause buyers of Carvana’s receivables – or stock – to pull out?

Ernest Garcia II: A History Of
Fraudulent Activity


Ernest Garcia II, founder of DriveTime and father of Carvana CEO Ernie Garcia III, pleaded guilty to bank fraud charges in 1990 
alongside his partner – and now DriveTime CEO – Raymond Fidel for their roles in the collapse of Lincoln Savings and Loan 


Association. They ultimately avoided jail time by testifying against their boss, Charles Keating. However, multiple charges have
been leveled against him since, including a lawsuit from shareholders in Ugly Duckling (now DriveTime), another dealing with 


credit application leaks, and another concerning bribes of CarMax salesmen to divert business. Most recently, in 2014, 
DriveTime was fined $8M by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau for “making harassing debt collection calls.” 


Importantly, we note that Carvana makes no mention of Garcia II’s background despite his status as controlling shareholder.

Woefully Inexperienced C-Suite


All Carvana senior executives are 40 years old or younger. Only Chief Product Officer Daniel Gill had experience as a senior 
executive of a company prior to joining Carvana – with a start-up which, according to Crunchbase, raised no more than $25M. 
CEO Garcia has spent only two years of his professional life outside of companies controlled by his father. CFO Mark Jenkins 
was most recently an economics professor, and had no prior public company experience in finance, accounting, or treasury, 


which are traditional breeding grounds for public company CFOs. He is supported in the treasury function by an individual who
filed for personal bankruptcy, calling into question his suitability to manage financial affairs for a public company. 


Spruce Point does not believe management is best suited to run a large, capital-intensive public company.

In Spruce Point’s Opinion, Carvana Board 
Members Are Not Entirely Independent


Outside of Michael Maroone, an experienced auto dealer executive with companies including AutoNation, no member of the 
Board of Directors is both independent and deeply experienced in the industry. Greg Sullivan served as an executive with 


DriveTime from 1995-2007. Though Ira Platt spent several years in automotive financing early in his career, the vast majority of
his career has been spent in banking and venture capital, and he was a director of DriveTime from 2014-17.


And Dan Quayle – hey, what’s he doing here?

Political Donations To A Member Of The Board?


Upon further review, Quayle’s presence on the board seems a bit less mystifying…
Quayle received political donations from Garcia II years ago. More recently, both Garcia II and Garcia III have given financial 


support to his son, Ben.


How independent and objective can Dan Quayle really be as a Board member?

Insiders Selling Aggressively


Insiders have been selling aggressively over the last six months, just as Ally cut back on its lending to Carvana and as earnings 
became more dependent on one-off drivers.

Convoluted Shareholder Structure
Favoring Insiders


A bizarrely complex organizational structure gives Earnest Garcia II significant economic and voting control over Carvana. 
Meanwhile, the public float (fully diluted for all share classes) is limited by Garcia’s 70% stake, together with the large stakes of 


other sizable early investors. We are concerned that insiders – the Garcias in particular – designed this structure to benefit 
themselves over public shareholders.

92


Convoluted Shareholder Structure
Favoring Insiders


Ernest Garcia II’s significant holdings of Class B shares gives him 90% of total voting rights. While Class B shares themselves 
confer no economic rights, they are fungible into Class A shares when combined with an “LLC Unit,” which were distributed 
prior to the IPO. This leaves Garcia with effective economic control of Carvana of 70%. The IPO structure is a convenient way
for Garcia to monetize his fortune in the used car business, where his prior attempt take DriveTime public failed. He also does 


not have to disclose his troubled legal past as he is not formally on the management team.

A Used Auto Dealer Covered By Tech Analysts:
Do They Understand The Business?


Sell-side firms vary widely in how they assign CVNA to industry groups: some categorize it liberally as a “technology” or 
“business services” name, while others more appropriately group it with other auto-related stocks.


Importantly, we note that technology and internet analysts tend to assign a relatively higher price target to the stock, while auto 
analysts, “industrial technology” analysts, etc. tend to be more conservative in their valuations. We believe that auto-oriented


analysts are much more likely to understand Carvana as a business than are tech or business services analysts, and believe that 
their lower valuations, while still excessive on the whole, are likely better-informed than those of their tech counterparts.

Carvana Trades In-Line With Asset-Light
E-Commerce Firms, Not Auto Dealers


CVNA trades much more like an e-commerce firm than an auto dealer – yet its business model is much closer to that of other auto 
dealers. Carvana buys vehicles, maintains inventory, manages a logistics network, originates loans, etc. – much like a traditional 
auto dealer. Other auto sales sites like CarGurus are simply lead-generation businesses and maintain no inventory of their own. 


While both are “auto e-commerce” sites, their business models are so different that they cannot be considered good comps.


CVNA should trade in-line with other auto dealers, not asset-light auto e-commerce sites.

Spruce Point Sees 50%-70% Downside In CVNA 
At The Very Minimum


Without attempting to project Carvana’s financials out 3-5 years or longer, it’s impossible to value the business on earnings or
EBITDA – and that’s assuming you’re comfortable with the assumption that the business will ever achieve positive profitability. 
Carvana is winning over analysts and investors because it’s a TAM stock: spin a good enough story about how big you might 
grow and how good the economics might be if everything works out, and investors won’t want to miss out on the opportunity. 


We are much more skeptical on both Carvana’s growth and the economics of the underlying business. However, for the sake of 
taking stock of where the market stands, we go through the exercise of valuing CVNA on an EV/Sales basis below.


Applying a generous 0.5x to 0.75x EV/2019E sales, we estimate that CVNA shares have 50%-70% downside from current levels.

More Realistic: Carvana Is A Ticking Time 
Bomb Waiting To Go To Zero


The bulls want you to think that this stock is valuable because the top-line growth is there and the story is good. They’re still 
waiting on profit and cash flow, but they’re excited enough about the growth potential and qualitative aspects of the business 


model to trust that earnings will come. Call it the Ray Kinsella theory of investing: “If you build it, they will come.”


The reality: not only do you have to believe in the underlying economics of the business, but you have to believe that (A) the 
sales today are real and self-sustaining, and (B) that the financing will continue to be there until Carvana is a sustainable 


business. What happens if the seemingly-irrational buyers of Carvana’s subprime auto loans withdraw financing, or lack the 
capacity to fund a larger Carvana? Could gross profit recover? Would anyone else step up to provide funding? What happens if 
the credit cycle turns, and junk-rated Carvana is no longer able to fund the cash burn? What happens if regulators come down 


on Carvana for moving hard and fast to grow sales and generate earnings (neglecting inspection and reconditioning obligations, 
illegally selling VSCs for more 100% gross margin sales, generating outsized VSC profits via related-party dealings, etc.)?


Topic What The Bulls Think Reality


Sales Growth
People like to buy things from the convenience of their home. They don’t want 
to have to deal with used car salesmen.


Carvana is a subprime loan originator earning vastly off-market returns on the 
sale of its receivables. Why should we believe that this will be sustainable as the 
Company grows?


Profitability Of 
Core Business


They can magically make more money off subprime lending than everyone else 
– just trust them!


Subprime auto lending is a competitive, well-trodden business. Why would they 
be so much better at making money from reselling subprime loans? (Maybe a 
party associated with an insider is helping out?)


Scalability
Tech businesses are asset-light and scale well. This business will be profitable 
soon – and it will be substantially more profitable than everyone else.


Carvana says it can cut more than 50% of non-D&A, non-advertising SG&A out of 
the traditional auto dealer model – but it still needs inventory, “advocates,” 
physical locations, IRCs, *AND* a heavier logistics network and tech R&D.


Cash Burn And 
Financing Needs


Hot, high-tech growth businesses burn cash for a while – everyone knows this! 
Just wait and the earnings will come. It’s basically Amazon!


This is a CCC+ rated subprime used auto dealer burning cash with no immediate 
path to profitability, relying financial backers with ties to the Company. If the 
credit cycle turns or these parties exit, there is no more business.


Business Practices 
And Customer 
Relations


The vending machines are so cool! The advocates are really nice!
Carvana is not inspecting and reconditioning vehicles property. It may be 
running afoul of consumer protection laws.


VSC Sales High-margin add-on.
Potentially selling VSCs illegally and getting attractive terms from related-party 
warranty servicer.


Management And 
Actors


They’re super-smart Harvard and Stanford guys! What’s a Board of Directors?
No public company experience. Extremely limited management experience or 
auto of any kind. CEO possibly surrogate of felonious bank fraudster. Non-
independent directors with political connections. So many tied-in parties…
98


How This Goes To Zero


Spruce Point believes that, with such heavy capital needs, and with so many things that can go wrong, Carvana can be 
deemed a zero without much imagination.


Topic How This Goes To Zero


Dependence On Unknown 
Parties For Profitable Sale Of 
Subprime Auto Loans


• Carvana appears to be selling subprime auto loans at vastly off-market rates to unknown buyers. A 
vital source of profit for the Company may disappear without counterparties’ continued ability and 
willingness to buy loans at unheard-of premiums.


• Should these parties, without a known rationale for supporting Carvana, choose to withdraw their 
support – or lack the capacity to support a larger Carvana – the Company may lack necessary funding 
to persist as a viable business


Dependence On Credit


• If the credit cycle turns, auto loan delinquencies rise, and financing becomes harder to obtain,
Carvana could experience serious funding issues as a CCC+ rated subprime auto dealer


• There is already evidence that Ally is cutting back. Tim Russi, a key supporter of DriveTime/Carvana 
at Ally, recently left the company.


Business Practices Come Under 
Greater Scrutiny


• Consumer protection investigations into Carvana’s inspection and repair practices, or warranty 
transparency (e.g. CFPB already fined DriveTime $8m in 2014)


• Investigation into unlicensed sale of GAP waiver coverage
• Violation of consumer protection or other laws triggers loan reassignment / put-back risk to CVNA
• Associated parties no longer large enough to support growing VSC commissions


Management / Board / 
Employee Turnover


• Departures of Board members deemed “independent” or managers in key roles (e.g. Moorehead –
Director of Finance, Accounting and Tax just quietly left in Oct 2018)


• Employee turnover increases as rank/file demand higher wages and no longer accept stock grants 
from management


Equity Investors Lose Faith


• Investors grow tired of continuing to prop up the stock on the expectation that the Company will 
scale and generate positive profits one day. They balk at backstopping additional cash burn.


• Rotation investor base from momentum / tech investors to more traditional auto investors 
triggers selling
