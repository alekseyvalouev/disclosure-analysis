Summary
Over the past few months a lot of evidence pointing to liquidity "crisis"/problems at
EROS has been presented in various venues.


EROS has sold a 9.13% stake in EROS INTERNATIONAL MEDIA  LTD on the
Indian market between April 24, 2017 and May 8, 2017.


EROS furthermore has pledged approximately what appear to be 2nd tier Indian
lenders during the period between March 2017 and May 2017.


Documents reveal that  EROS INTERNATIONAL FILMS PRIVATE LIMITED (a
Subsidiary of EROS) is now buying a property that belongs to Mr. Sunil Lulla and
his Relative Mr. Kishore Lula for approximately $8.49m - $8.80m (Rs. 53 crores to
Rs 55. crores)


EROS insiders in need of liquidity too?


Despite EROS CEO saying "‘Absolutely no question of a liquidity crisis’ ", lots of
evidence pointing to the contrary has been presented to (Link1, Link2, Link3).

As a market participant, I do find quite concerning the fact that:


Despite EROS not being able to repay the off-shore Credit Facility expiring in
January 2017 on time ... 


1.


... despite EROS need to liquidate in the "open market" shares of its major revenue
generating subsidiary (Co raised approx. from the sale $20sh million) ... 


2.


... despite the need to pledge shares of its major revenue generating subsidiary to
what seem to be 2nd tier Indian lenders ... 


3.


... A SUBSIDIARY OF EROS IS SPENDING APPROX. $8.65 MILION TO BUY A
OFFICE PROPERTY FROM INSIDERS.  This becomes more interesting when we
consider the fact that for the year ended 31 March 2016  EROS INTERNATIONAL
FILMS PRIVATE LIMITED had revenue of just $548,157 (Rs 34,259,818), total cash
and bank balances of $2.2 million (INR 13,84,79,629)


4.


My personal view is: "A company that can't honor its debts on time ... and engages in
dilutive transactions for US shareholders ... IMO ... shouldn't be buying personal assets
for millions from insiders - EROS is doing just that!"


HERE IS THE PROOF:
