CSKI’s New Drugs: One Kills People, the Other Is
27 Years Old.


Posted on May 27, 2009 by Asensio.com


Yesterday China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued a


press release stating that the company had obtained production


approval for “two of its newly developed drugs” from China’s State


Food and Drug Administration. One drug is “acyclovir gel,” used to


treat herpes simplex. The other drug is “Shuanghuanglian


suppositories,” used for cold and flu symptoms.


Despite China Sky’s suggestion that these drugs are “newly


developed,” both have long been manufactured by other firms in


different forms.


Shuanghuanglian is an old Chinese herbal remedy. It is sold in


China in many different forms. It is even available for sale in the US


in capsule form as an herbal supplement. China Sky appears new


only in offering the herbal remedy as a “suppository.”


An injectable Shuanghuanglian product reportedly caused the


death of a person who used it earlier this year, which prompted


Chinese health authorities to suspend sales of the injectable form of


the product (See press reports 1, 2, and 3). There are even press


reports of three people falling sick from using Shuanghuanglian in


the city of Harbin, where China Sky’s operating company is based.


The other drug mentioned in the press release, acyclovir, dates at


least from 1982, when Burroughs Wellcome Co. filed to obtain a US


patent for a method of producing acyclovir. A US patent for


acyclovir gel, the product CSKI is claiming to make, was filed in


1993. China issued a patent on acyclovir in 1995. There are dozens


of other patents for different forms and preparations of the drug.


One might expect more innovative product offerings from a


company describing itself as “a leading fully integrated
