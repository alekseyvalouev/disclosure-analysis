WORLD ACCEPTANCE
CORP (WRLD) — PART
DEUX


“Americans know that they have a
responsibility to live within their means and
pay what they owe. But they also have a right
to not get ripped o� by the sudden rate
hikes, unfair penalties, and hidden fees …” 
President Barack Obama   (May 10, 2009)


While President Obama was referring speci�cally to
usurious credit card practices, those are tame and
civil compared to how World Acceptance does
business.  Citron believes in the New America, it is
only time before either legislatures, the courts, or
its own debt/receivables collapse the “shady”
business of World Acceptance.  This report clari�es
the pivotal di�erence that makes World’s business
model much more vulnerable than the payday
lending industry.


In this report, Citron will �rst expose an accounting
arti�ce used by World Acceptance and then will
address the judicial risk the company and its
shareholders bear.  Citron still believes that the
headwinds this company faces are too great, and
will eventually force exposure of the farce that its
book of receivables and business model really is.


Financials at WRLD are worse than they
appear

Citron wishes to draw particular attention to
World’s reliance upon the arcane “Rule of 78’s” in its
revenue stream.   To our knowledge, it is the only
publicly traded company whose main revenue
stream is derived directly from the rule of 78s. 
Simply put, the rule of 78’s allows the lender to
frontload the bulk of the interest in the beginning
of the loan payment schedule.  And for customers
of WRLD and investors who want to understand the
income statement, it is a lesson in subterfuge,
because WRLD’s loans so rarely go to maturity.

[http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/auto/20010827a.asp]


This method is well known to be grossly unfair to
borrowers, however — so much so that it is illegal
in at least 16 states, and illegal for longer term
loans in many others.


Note these e�ects of the Rule of 78’s, both of which
are central to WRLD’s business:


“1. The higher the interest rate, the greater
the penalty amount to the borrower.” 
“2. The earlier the prepayment in relation to
the term, the greater the penalty amount for
the borrower.”     http://www.pine-
grove.com/reading%20room/rule-of-78s.htm
[http://www.pine-
grove.com/reading%20room/rule-of-
78s.htm]


Note how the Rule of 78s works hand in glove to
extort money from borrowers caught in serial loan
�ipping schemes exempli�ed by WRLD.  These
consumers are always paying the �rst and second
month payments of a new amortization schedule –
which have the highest front-loaded interest –
compared to amortization schedules calculated
actuarially.  The company thereby continues to
collect a higher e�ective interest rate than it
discloses to its borrowers.


But much of this money is not real; it just
accumulates as a near half-billion receivable of
dubious collectability on its books.

WRLD’s $460.4 million net loan book is the least
collectible, lowest quality asset of any public
company we know.  It is our opinion that the book
is worth not even 10 cents on the dollar if put into
runo�, while new legislative initiatives and judicial
challenges bring that risk much closer to reality.


When a borrower fails to make scheduled loan
payments to a normal bank, the bank is required by
regulations to categorize the loan as impaired. 
With World, it just gets �ipped to a new loan with a
higher principal.   According to the company’s own
disclosures, the average loan has been �ipped 4 to
5 times.  Presumptively, the main reason for
�ipping a loan is the borrower couldn’t pay it o�.


Consider as an example a recent lawsuit in Texas by
Mrs. Subrina Parker.  This case was brought after
fell behind on her payments and was harassed by
WRLD employees.  She was paying $50 a month on
a $250 loan, on terms which the suit alleges violate
the Texas Finance Code.  After WRLD called her co-
workers, supervisor, and children, the she �led
suit.  The suit eventually went to arbitration; it is the
company’s main defense tactic.

[http://citronresearch.com/wp-

A landmark ruling just issued by the New Mexico
Supreme Court this month, however, held that
World’s arbitration clause, which is a part of every
single one of its loan documents, is unenforceable
due to being “unconscionable” (so one-sidedly
unfair that it isn’t a legal agreement).  This opens
the door to a borrower’s suit challenging World’s
business practices being granted class action status
in the courts.


When the �rst of these cases is in fact granted class
action status, very important consequences begin
to fall on World.  For one, every current and recent
borrower in the state receives o�cial notice that a
legal challenge is in progress, which will itself impair
their collections.  Second, class action status
provides substantial economic incentive which
levels the legal playing �eld.  A loss in such a case

could impair World’s operations in at least the state
where it is located, and potentially expose it to a
large adverse judgment.


In addition to the suits mentioned above, a newly
�led Illinois suit (Dean vs World Finance) alleges
that all of World’s loans violate the Federal Truth in
Lending law as well as Illinois consumer lending
laws.  Because of the recent New Mexico ruling,
there is greatly increased risk that this suit will be
litigated as a Federal class action case.

Finally, World’s litigation risk disclosure states:


“From time to time the Company is involved
in routine litigation relating to claims arising
out of its operations in the normal course of
business.  The Company believes that it is not
presently a party to any such pending legal
proceedings that would have a material
adverse e�ect on its �nancial condition.”


In light of the claims in the abovementioned
lawsuits, Citron believes this language is so
inadequate it is a joke, except as an invitation to a
future shareholder class action suit against
management.


Imagine you had a maxed out credit card with
Capital One.  You notify them that you cannot not
pay your minimum – and the next thing you know,
they increase your limit, give you a cash advance on
your new credit to make your minimum payment,
and charge you a fat fee to extend your credit,
taking up most of the new higher credit line.  Is this
even remotely sustainable business practice in the
current economic climate?  Is this a book of
receivables that you want to own?


This explains how installment loan borrowers such
as John Gilbert in Oklahoma, Subrina Parker in
Texas, Mr. Webb in Illinois and Ms. Cordova in New
Mexico wind up paying “$2,000 just to borrow
$250”, or “well over 100%” and get trapped in debt

by their installment loans extended by WRLD.

They’re not exceptions, they’re representative
examples.   Citron is con�dent that real court tests
of these practices will be ominous for World as the
get shut out of the loophole of arbitration.


World Acceptance vs. Payday Lenders – Apples
and Oranges


After reading part I, some of Citron’s readers
confused WRLD with a payday lender.  The business
models are starkly di�erent.  When you compare
�nancials, you will understand that World
Acceptance makes any payday lender look like
Goldman Sachs.  For this we take as an example the
largest publicly traded payday lender : Advance
America, and also EZ Corp, the largest pawnbroker.

Citron believes that a half-billion dollar book of
unsecured loans, �ipped multiple times, has a huge
undisclosed risk of collection.  This asset just
doesn’t pass the reasonable man test.  While a
payday loan is essentially secured by a known
upcoming payroll check expected within the next

two weeks, WRLD’s loans are for terms stretching
months, and are secured by nothing


Right out of the Guilty Playbook


Just yesterday, WRLD �led an 8-K, announcing their
plan to increase a current $10 million stock buyback
plan (which is currently unexecuted) to $15 million
stock buyback — all of this with only $6.2 million in
the bank.   (Maybe they can get an installment
loan…).  Why a stock buyback now?  Is it because
Citron has exposed the company for what it is and
this is a way to respond?  The stock is still currently
trading above its 50 day moving average.  What is
the urgency to burn its scant cash to buy its own
stock?  This reminds us of the last two companies
over the past two years who have tried the same
tactic in response to skeptical questions raised by
Citron.

Conclusion


As a business model, WRLD has been the master of
loopholes.  Loan �ipping, tacked-on renewal fees,
single-premium “credit insurance” plus Rule of 78-
calculated interest, all exist only because of
loopholes in states’ various usury laws, and
speci�cally the 11 states that haven’t closed them. 
The �nancial e�ect of this crazy business is
unsustainable revenues �owing to current income,
while the toxic impairments are swept into the loan
portfolio, where the company can shield the hidden
risk to investors ….. for a while.


In Part 3, Citron will explore how likely government
reform of consumer lending could soon restrict or
totally halt the company from indulging in these
predatory lending practices.  If WRLD’s operations
in even a single state are shut down, it will be
forced to put that state’s portfolio into runo�,

exposing its uncollectability.  That is why Citron
believes the potential risk of drastically interrupted
operations has to be priced into WRLD’s stock.
