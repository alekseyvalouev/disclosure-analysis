 This report presents substantial, 
overwhelming, and conclusive evidence 
that Tianhe is one of the largest stock 
market frauds ever conceived. 


 SAIC filings and third-party documents 
show that Tianhe generates a fraction of 
the revenues and profits it reports. 


 We present smoking gun evidence that 
Tianhe does not pay the taxes it claims, 
and therefore could not have generated 
the profits it claims.  


 Site visits show that most of Tianhe’s SFC 
customers are related parties that share 
offices and overlapping management.

JP Morgan was lucky to have withdrawn from Tianhe’s IPO. 
 
It’s hard to imagine that three years after the fall of Sino-Forest, a fraud twice its size could navigate 
through a sea of regulators, investment bankers, and auditors to list on a global stock exchange.  
 
Yet here we are. 
 
Tianhe Chemicals is a US$8 billion company that went public on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange earlier 
this year as one of the biggest IPOs of 2014. The listing turned the Company owner and founder, Mr. 
Wei Qi into a billionaire and Northeast China’s richest man.


1
  


 
However, we have conducted months of due diligence, field research and analysis which show that 
Tianhe is a massive fraud and one of the largest stock market scams ever conceived. This report details 
our findings, including extensive analysis of government documents and SAIC filings, site visits to 
Tianhe’s purported customers and review of industry data. Our sources also conducted field interviews 
with former employees and competitors that completely contradict Tianhe’s stated position as a leader 
in China’s chemical market.   
 
Additionally, this report will also provide background on Frost & Sullivan, a firm that had a significant 
role to play in legitimizing Tianhe’s claims, and is cited throughout its prospectus. 
 
In the end, we don’t just expect Tianhe to be unwound and delisted, we also expect the Securities and 
Futures Commission to bring criminal charges against the architects of its IPO.

Our investigation shows that Tianhe Chemicals (“Tianhe”) is one of the largest stock market frauds ever 
conceived. We present irrefutable evidence that Tianhe’s IPO prospectus and subsequent earnings 
announcements massively overstate the scale, scope and profitability of Tianhe’s business. 
 
Overstated profitability: original SAIC filings of Tianhe’s relevant operating subsidiaries show that in 
2012, Tianhe’s true revenue was 85% less than it reports, and its net income was almost 100% less. 
Similar overstatements were made for 2011. We present additional government and third-party 
evidence that corroborate the SAIC filings and discredit the IPO prospectus. 
 
Contradictory tax data: we present smoking gun evidence from relevant tax authorities that Tianhe 
does not pay the taxes it claims. If its financial statements were accurate, Tianhe’s tax payments would 
exceed all the tax revenue collected by the jurisdictions in which it operates 
 
Two sets of books: we provide evidence that Tianhe has created fake SAIC filings to match its 
prospectus, and in the process, presented two sets of books to the SAIC. The original set was audited by 
a registered local auditing firm and shows that Tianhe is a fraud. This set contains anti-counterfeit 
stamps which can be used to verify the authenticity of the SAIC filings online with the relevant 
accounting oversight body. A second set was audited by Deloitte and matches with Tianhe’s IPO 
prospectus. However, we believe this set to be a fake created ahead of the IPO because among other 
reasons, it does not contain the necessary anti-counterfeit stamps, nor any form of verification code.  
 
Related-party customers: our investigation shows that most of Tianhe’s biggest, disclosed SFC 
customers are all either related parties, very small and/or bordering on non-existent.  
 
Impossible market size: Tianhe claims the secret of its profitability stems from its ability to produce and 
sell anti-mar in commercial quantities. However, reports by industry experts, backed up by market 
research show that i) Tianhe’s claimed sales of anti-mar are twice the size of the total market, ii) Tianhe 
is not known by industry players, and iii) statements by former employees show that Tianhe does not 
produce anti-mar, but a far less profitable and less valuable solvent used in the anti-mar process. 
 
Conclusion: we believe that this is the end for Tianhe. Tianhe came to the market as one of the biggest 
IPOs of 2014, and at US$8 billion we believe it will collapse as one of the biggest frauds in history.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 


Executive Summary
5 
 


 
 
Tianhe claims to be one of China’s leading chemical producers with two principal business segments, 
namely Lubricant Oil Additives (“LOA”) and Specialty Fluorochemicals (“SFC”).


2
  





 LOA: Lubricant additives are added to base oils and used by lubricant manufacturers to produce 
industrial and commercial lubricant products. In turn, these products are used in a broad range 
of industries, including engine oil for automobiles, ships and turbines, and in virtually any other 
application where metal-to-metal moving parts are utilized. Tianhe considers itself the largest 
LOA producer in China and the sixth largest producer worldwide.


3
 Tianhe names its top LOA 


competitors as Lubrizol, Infineum, Chevron Oronite, Afton, and Chemtura. 
 


 SFC: Specialty fluorochemicals have a diverse range of applications, including anti-corrosion, 
fire/water resistance and surface protectants. Given their wide-ranging use, SFCs are used in 
everything from leather and textile finishing agents to eyeglasses and touch panel coating. 
Tianhe names its SFC competitors as DuPont, Solvay, Asahi Glass, and Daikin.

The specialty chemical industry is defined by significant barriers to entry, including advanced R&D 
capabilities, complicated production processes, and arduous certification and testing requirements. 
Even if an emerging chemical company has the technical capabilities, OEMs generally stick with 
established suppliers that have a proven track record, brand recognition, and quality assurance systems. 
The product certification process itself is highly complex and time-consuming which discourages 
customers from switching chemical suppliers. 
 
Given these immense barriers, the most successful chemical companies got their start over a century 
ago and developed their technical know-how through two World Wars. The one notable exception is 
Tianhe who can trace its roots back to 1992, and only established its first operating subsidiary in 2004.

In its prospectus, Tianhe reports incredible revenue growth and profitability. Between 2011 and 2013, 
Tianhe’s revenue purportedly grew an average of 22.4% annually to RMB5 billion (US$812M). In that 
same period, Tianhe claims net income tripled from RMB0.9 billion to RMB2.6 billion (US$424M):

Tianhe’s stated profitability is derived from superior operating margins of over 60%. By comparison, all 
of Tianhe’s competitors report operating margins well below 30%:

Fabricated Revenues and Profits
7 
 


While Tianhe presents itself as a top-tier chemical company to investors, government documents show 
that the reality of Tianhe is much different than what the Company has presented in its prospectus and 
subsequent earnings announcements. SAIC


5
 filings for Tianhe’s operating subsidiaries show that the 


Company’s revenue and size as stated in its IPO prospectus are grotesque fabrications. 
 
According to the prospectus, Tianhe has five onshore subsidiaries of which only two had commenced 
business operations as of 31 December 2013: Jinzhou DPF-TH and Fuxin Hengtong. Tianhe conducts all 
its business through these two subsidiaries:

 By way of background, chinese companies are required to file annual financial and business information with the 


State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC). SAIC filings are public documents.
8 
 


We present the SAIC income statements for these two subsidiaries below. These documents show that 
Tianhe’s real revenue and net income are SIGNIFICIANTLY LESS than what has been presented to 
investors.  SAIC filings show that in 2012, Tianhe’s actual revenue was 85% less than it claimed in its 
prospectus, and its net income was nearly 100% less. Similar dramatic overstatements were made for 
2011:

The SAIC filings show that at best, Tianhe is a relatively small company which generates only a fraction 
of the business it claims. This is a far cry from the unbelievably lucrative US$8 billion chemical giant that 
has been presented to investors. Given these discrepancies, Tianhe’s IPO prospectus appears to contain 
some of the most fabricated financial statements we have ever encountered.

Net Income: RMB11 million (US$1.7 million) 
 
The 2012 SAIC filings contained a financial summary page which shows revenue and net income figures 
for the year. This form is signed by the Chairman Wei Qi, under a sentence which reads “I confirm the 
content of the submitted annual audited report is true.”
13 
 


Supporting Evidence from Industry Website 
 
In addition to SAIC filings, numerous government and third-party documents contradict Tianhe’s 
reported financials. In a press release dated 25 November 2011, an industry website citing the Fuxin 
local government announced that Tianhe’s Fuxin Hengtong subsidiary generated revenue of RMB230 
million in the first ten months of 2011: 
 
 


 
Source: http://info.chem.hc360.com/2011/11/251031323958.shtml 


 
 
If we annualize that figure (RMB230 million ÷ 10 x 12) we get RMB276 million, which matches Fuxin 
Hengtong’s 2011 SAIC revenue figure of RMB275 million. This announcement further proves that 
Tianhe’s prospectus is a work of fiction. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



http://info.chem.hc360.com/2011/11/251031323958.shtml
14 
 


Supporting Evidence from Liaoning Daily 
 
The Liaoning Daily is the official newspaper of the Liaoning Province Committee of the Communist Party 
of China, and distributed in Tianhe’s home province of Liaoning. According to an article published by the 
newspaper on 19 June 2012, Fuxin Hengtong generated revenue of RMB43 million and pre-tax earnings 
and VAT of RMB8 million in the first four months of 2012: 
 


 
         Source: http://news.lnd.com.cn/htm/2012-06/19/content_2361265.htm  


 
 
If we annualize the revenue figure (RMB43 million ÷ 4 x 12) we get RMB129 million, which is consistent 
with Fuxin Hengtong’s 2012 SAIC revenue figure of RMB143 million. Once again, this confirms the 
numbers in the SAIC filings, and discredits the IPO prospectus. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 



http://news.lnd.com.cn/htm/2012-06/19/content_2361265.htm
15 
 


Supporting Evidence from Local Chemical Industry Size 
 
According to the prospectus, Tianhe generated SFC revenue of RMB1.5 billion in 2011.


6
 The prospectus 


does not disclose the SFC revenue split between Fuxin Hengtong and Jinzhou DPF-TH. However, the 
prospectus does note that prior to October 2013, both subs operated four SFC production lines each.


7
 


Given that Fuxin Hengtong operated half the SFC production lines, it’s reasonable to assume that it also 
generated half the revenue, or RMB750 million. 
 
Fuxin is home to a number of fluorochemical companies, with a fluorochemical industrial park having 
been built in the city in 2004.


8
 However, according to an announcement dated 19 December 2011 by the 


Fuxin government, the entire City’s fluorochemical industry generated total output of only RMB900 
million for the 11 months from January 2011 to November 2011: 
 
 


 
     Source: http://www.fuxin.gov.cn/fx/zwgk/zdxm/content/183667.html 
 
 
Given the limited output and considering that numerous companies operate in the City, we are not sure 
how Tianhe can claim to have generated total SFC sales of RMB1.5 billion. Furthermore, this 
announcement mentions Fuxin Hengtong by name as one of 19 active contributors, so it would be 
impossible to argue that the government forgot to include the output from Tianhe’s subsidiary in its 
calculations.

Adding further doubt to Tianhe’s claims, we found the following company profile for Fuxin Hengtong on 
an industry website where buyers and sellers connect: 
 


 
   Source: http://fxht.en.ec21.com/company_info.jsp 


 
 
Considering the wording, this profile appears to be written by the subsidiary itself. We note that this 
profile was registered at the end of 2012 (19 November 2012) and states that the annual revenue of 
Fuxin Hengtong is between US$10M and US$50M. 
 
In 2012, Tianhe reported SFC revenue of RMB2.4 billion.


9
 Again, if we assume that Fuxin Hengtong 


generated half, it would translate to revenue of RMB1.2 billion or US$194M. This amount falls outside 
the range of US$10M to US$50M. 
 
However, worth mentioning is that the SAIC filings show that Fuxin Hengtong generated revenue of 
RMB143 million (US$23M) in 2012. This number fits perfectly in the range provided by the company 
profile.

If Tianhe’s sales and profit figures as presented in its prospectus were accurate, the Company would be 
a substantial tax payer in the jurisdictions in which it operates. In China, there are two major taxes: 
 


1. A 17% VAT (Value Added Tax) is paid on sales less cost of goods sold, adjusted for D&A and 
direct labor (adjusted gross profit), and 


2. Income tax on pre-tax earnings. 
 


Exhibit 3 shows our calculations of total Company-level taxes and Exhibit 4 shows subsidiary-level taxes.

Note: we subtract D&A and direct labour from CoGS because these components receive no VAT tax returns. We note that equipment and machinery 
get tax returns, but not property purchases or construction in progress. Page I-33 of the prospectus shows that machinery spending was minimal, so 
we ignore this for calculation purposes. Income tax paid figures are from page I-8 and CoGS figures and adjustments are from page 214.

Note: the prospectus states that Jinzhou DPF-TH generates all the LOA business, and we assume the SFC revenue is split equally between the two 
subs, as discussed on page 15. Accordingly, we have prorated income taxes based on percent of gross profit as determined by the revenue split.

In this section, we present smoking gun evidence that Tianhe is not paying the taxes it claims and 
therefore not generating the profits it claims.  
 
According to the prospectus, in 2011 Tianhe reported adjusted gross profit of RMB1.62 billion which 
translates to VAT taxes of RMB276 million. Additionally, Tianhe reported income taxes paid of RMB201 
million that year. Combined, Tianhe should have paid total taxes of RMB477 million in 2011.  
 
In subsequent years, Tianhe’s tax payments would have grown in tandem with its gross profit and 
income, reaching RMB823 million in 2012 and nearly RMB1 billion in 2013. These sums would be paid by 
Tianhe’s two operating subsidiaries, Jinzhou DPF-TH and Fuxin Hengtong. 
 
Based on our calculations, Jinzhou DPF-TH alone would have paid total taxes of RMB316 million in 2011. 
However, according to the Jinzhou local government, only seven companies paid more than RMB100 
million in national taxes (VAT and income tax) in 2011, and Jinzhou DPF-TH was not one of them:

If Tianhe’s prospectus is to be believed, Jinzhou DPF-TH would have been among the biggest local tax 
payers and certainly made this list.  
 
But it did not.

Furthermore, on the website of Yi County – where Jinzhou DPF-TH is based and pays taxes to – the 
government’s Year in Review report for 2013 notes that there was no company in Yi County that paid 
more than RMB100 million in taxes.

In fact, according to the government, the entire bureau of Yi County only collected tax revenue of 
RMB303 million in 2012:  
 


 
       Source: http://www.ln.gov.cn/zfxx/qsgd/yks_1/yx/201212/t20121221_1026592.html 
 
This announcement dated 21 December 2012, suggests that the Yi County government is proud of its 
RMB303 million tax revenue, noting 2012 as a historic milestone for achieving its annual budget two 
weeks before year-end. If Tianhe’s reported numbers were accurate, then Jinzhou DPF-TH alone would 
have paid approximately RMB495 million in total taxes, which is far more than the entire County 
collected.

To be clear, Jinzhou DPF-TH is not the only company in Yi County. In its announcement, Yi County 
ascribes the success of collecting RMB303 million to the growth of several companies. Jinzhou DPF-TH is 
not acknowledged, but the list provides an interesting read.

First on the list is Liaoning Jiudaoling coal mine which paid RMB138 million in taxes.


11
 Second and third 


are subsidiaries of Huishan Dairy (6863.HK), a Hong Kong listed company. The last and most interesting 
name on the list is Jinzhou Tianhe Import & Export, which is actually a private company owned by 
Tianhe’s Chairman, Mr. Wei Qi.


12
  


 
We find it telling that Mr. Wei’s private company made the list, but the US$8 billion company he took 
public did not. Clearly, one is more profitable than the other.

The story is much the same with Tianhe’s other subsidiary, Fuxin Hengtong. According to the Fuxin 
Haizhou District Tax Bureau – where Fuxin Hengtong is located and pays taxes – the District collected tax 
revenue of RMB103 million in the first five months of 2014. 
 
     Fuxin Haizhou District Tax Bureau announcement dated 6 July 2014 


 
     Source: http://www.mxwz.com/center/view.aspx?ID=1748474  


 
 
If Tianhe’s prospectus were true, then in 2013 Fuxin Hengtong should have paid total taxes (VAT + 
income taxes) of approximately RMB396 million. This amount would have increased in 2014 considering 
Tianhe reported marvelous first-half 2014 results.


13
 However, if we assume no growth in 2014, on a pro-


rated basis, Fuxin Hengtong should still have paid ~RMB165 million in the first five months of 2014 
(RMB396 ÷ 12 x 5). This is more than all of Fuxin Haizhou District collected in taxes.

The amount of tax revenue collected by the relevant local governments is only a fraction of what would 
be needed to validate Tianhe’s reported financial statements. The sources we have cited are all 
competent government authorities responsible for collecting taxes in their jurisdictions. Tianhe’s 
absence from these announcements, combined with the amount of taxes collected by these jurisdictions 
is irrefutable evidence that Tianhe is not paying the taxes it claims, and therefore not generating the 
profit it claims.

Historically, discrepancies between SAIC filings and regulatory filings (SEC, HKex) have been the 
foundation of most Chinese fraud whistleblower pieces. In the last few years, a legion of Chinese stock 
market scams have been exposed this way and ultimately collapsed.  
 
As a sign of the entrepreneurial spirit, fraudsters have changed their tactics, often resorting to forging 
their SAIC filings to make them consistent with their regulatory filings. We believe this is the path Tianhe 
took, albeit at a grade-school level. 
 
Over the course of our investigation into Tianhe, we were surprised to discover that Jinzhou DPF-TH has 
two sets of income statements with the SAIC. The first set appear to be the ‘original’ income statements 
which we have presented thus far, and which have been audited by registered local firm Liaoning 
Zhongheng Certified Public Accountants. This set contradicts the prospectus and shows that Tianhe is a 
massive fraud.  
 
There is also a ‘new’ income statement, which was audited by Deloitte and matches with Tianhe’s 
prospectus, as presented below: 
 
 
 





Two Sets of Books
24 
 


An analysis of the facts suggests that the Deloitte-audited income statement is a fake created by Tianhe 
ahead of its IPO.  
 
First, this filing reflects a consolidated income statement, which is odd. In our experience, SAIC financial 
statements generally pertain to individual subsidiaries and are not consolidated to the parent company 
level. 
 
Second, this new SAIC income statement is audited by Deloitte. We find it unusual that Tianhe would 
use Deloitte to sign off on its SAIC filings. In our experience, SAIC filings are always signed off by a local 
auditing firm. We suspect that since Deloitte had already been retained to sign off on Tianhe’s 
prospectus, it was easy to get them to sign off on matching SAIC files as well. Deloitte is by no means a 
stranger to signing off on fraudulent financial statements, having one of the worst auditing records in 
China.


14
 


 
To maintain consistency with this new SAIC income statement, the prospectus claims that the auditor of 
the Jinzhou DPF-TH subsidiary was Moore Rowlands in 2011, and Deloitte in 2012 and 2013: 
 


 
 Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0609/LTN20140609007.pdf pg. I-3 
 
 
However, the original SAIC filings for Jinzhou DPF-TH, which we presented earlier, were actually audited 
by Liaoning Zhongheng Certified Public Accountants in 2011 and 2012. This is the same local auditor that 
the prospectus acknowledges audits the Fuxin Hengtong subsidiary. Naturally, it makes perfect sense 
that one local auditor would audit both of Tianhe’s operating subsidiaries. 
 
But the prospectus makes no mention that Jinzhou DPF-TH was ever audited by Liaoning Zhongheng. 
This is a key point because it appears that Management does not want to acknowledge that a version of 
the Jinzhou DPF-TH SAIC filings that were audited by Liaoning Zhongheng exists. This is not surprising 
because those filings, as we have explained, show that Tianhe is a fraud. 
 
Below, we present proof that Jinzhou DPF-TH was in fact audited by Liaoning Zhongheng, and that this 
set is authentic. We wonder if Deloitte is aware that Tianhe has two sets of books, with two different 
auditors:

In a bizarre twist, on page 8 of the Deloitte-audited SAIC set there is a note that states the name of the 
auditor as Liaoning Zhongeng: 
 


 
 
 
We do not know what to make of this page, but we assume that in an attempt to legitimize the fake set 
of SAIC filings, Tianhe carelessly repackaged sections of the original SAIC filings and submitted it as part 
of the Deloitte audit.  
 
We presume that Tianhe will respond to this report by claiming that the original SAIC filings we have 
presented are fake and that investors should rely on the Deloitte version. However, any such argument 
is easily refuted because by government order, the Liaoning Institute of Certified Public Accountants set 
up an audit verification tool so that the public could verify the authenticity of SAIC filings.

As presented below, Tianhe’s LOA business has been relatively stagnant over the last three years. This is 
not surprising because the LOA industry is mature and generally grows in line with the engine oil and 
automobile market.  
 
This leaves the key to Tianhe’s revenue growth in its SFC segment. As per the prospectus, sales of SFC 
products have reportedly doubled between 2011 and 2013. The impact of this purported growth has 
been even more pronounced on Tianhe’s bottom line given that SFC margins (~85%) are substantially 
higher than LOA margins (~27%).

Yet, despite a prospectus that clocks in at 429 pages, Tianhe does not name a single one of its SFC 
customers or end-users. Instead, Tianhe has chosen to label its biggest customers as Customer A, B, C:

 By contrast, when chemical company Dongyue Group (189.HK) went public in Hong Kong in 2007, its prospectus 
disclosed a comprehensive list of customers.

The one time that Tianhe disclosed in writing the name of an SFC customer was in its draft prospectus, 
where it named CITIC International Co. Ltd. (“CITIC International”) as a customer. For whatever reason, 
CITIC International’s name was dropped from the final prospectus.  
 
The only other time we are aware that Tianhe has disclosed any information about its SFC customers 
was as part of the buildup to the IPO in response to investor inquiries. Management named its four 
biggest SFC customers as a percent of sales as: 
 


 CITIC International Co. Ltd., the trading and export/import subsidiary of state-owned CITIC 
Group, accounts for  40% of Tianhe’s SFC revenue (presumably Customer A) 


 Shanghai Xidatong, a private company, accounts for ~20% (presumably Customer C) 


 Shanghai Top Fluoro, a private company, accounts for ~15% 


 Heilongjiang Taina, a private company, purchased RMB300 million worth of SFC product

Notably, the prospectus states that 65% to 90% of Tianhe’s SFC sales between 2011 and 2013 were to 
trading companies.


19
 A recurring theme among the legion of stock market frauds that have blown up 


over the years is the use of trading companies or intermediaries as customers.
20‚21,22


 Fake intermediaries 
are relatively easy to set up, and they provide a means to plug the audit hole through paper 
transactions.  
 
For example, for over a decade Sino-Forest maintained that its business was conducted through a series 
of “authorized intermediaries” and in the process raised US$3 billion from unsuspecting investors. When 
Sino-Forest was eventually exposed as a massive fraud by Muddy Waters Research, it was revealed that 
the intermediaries were in fact undisclosed related parties that had been set up by the company itself.

In the case of Shanghai Xidatong, Shanghai Top, and Heilongjiang Taina, our investigation found that 
these ‘independent customers’ are all actually related parties with close ties to Tianhe that go far 
beyond a customer/supplier relationship. SAIC filings and site visits show that these customers share 
office buildings, overlapping management, and have limited business operations.
36 
 


Customer: Shanghai Xidatong     
 
During the IPO roadshow, the CEO of Xidatong, Mr. Zhang Silang was brought in to provide customer 
verification to prospective investors. On an Investec conference call held on 16 May 2014, Mr. Zhang 
told investors that Xidatong purchases (among other products) anti-mar from Tianhe.  
 
Anti-mar is an incredibly expensive substance primarily used to coat touch panels. On the call set up and 
moderated by Investec, Xidatong was said to have purchased from Tianhe 4 tons of pure anti-mar in 
2013, down from 6 tons in 2012. According to Investec, Xidatong accounted for approximately 20% of 
Tianhe’s SFC sales in 2013. Based on this information, we can conclude that Xidatong is Customer C, as 
per the prospectus. This means that Xidatong accounted for sales of RMB703 million in 2013 and 
RMB1.1 billion in 2012.  
 
However, SAIC filings we pulled for Xidatong show that this claim is a lie. The SAIC filings show that 
Xidatong is a tiny company with de minimis operations that generates negligible revenue and profits. In 
2012, Xidatong only generated RMB265 thousand on revenue of RMB36 million: 
 
 
Xidatong 2012 SAIC Income Statement 
Revenue: RMB36 million (US$5.7M) 
CoGS: RMB34 million (US$5.4M) 
Net Income: RMB265 thousand (US$42K)
37 
 


On the other side of its books, the balance sheet confirms that Xidatong is a thinly capitalized company 
unlikely to carry out business at the scope and size claimed, having only RMB7 million in cash and RMB1 
million in inventory: 
 
 
Xidatong 2012 SAIC Balance Sheet 
Cash: RMB7 million (US$1.1M) 
Inventory: RMB1 million (US$160K)
38 
 


To learn how it was possible for Xidatong to conduct business with almost no assets, we sent a team to 
the company’s registered address in Shanghai at: 


 
上海市浦东新区花木镇罗山路1700弄14号388室 


 
This address turned out to be an empty room in an old residential community that neighbors said hadn’t 
been used in at least five years: 
 
 





 
 
 
We have serious doubts that a multi-million dollar chemical enterprise ever operated out of this housing 
community.
39 
 


Xidatong also has a website which provides a contact address for the company in Shanghai at: 
 


中国 上海 上海市 上海市延安西路726号10楼F室 
 
Our team visited this address which turned out to be an office occupied by Boss International and FY. No 
one at the address had heard of Xidatong. 
 
 


 
 
 
Eventually, our team was able to locate Xidatong’s office, but it wasn’t until much later in our 
investigation. We revisit Xidatong’s office on page 52. 







http://www.hg-z.com/
40 
 


All the evidence so far suggests that Xidatong is not the large customer that Mr. Zhang Silang presented 
on the Investec conference call. The CEO of an independent customer would have very little reason to 
lie about its relationship with Tianhe – but our background check shows that Mr. Zhang is far from 
independent – indeed, he is a key figure that connects Tianhe and several of its key customers. 
 
A background check on Mr. Zhang shows that he has held his current position as far back as 2006, when 
he attended an industry conference as CEO of Xidatong:

41 
 


However, we found that Mr. Zhang also had other roles, such as a top-level executive at Tianhe. In June 
2008, Mr. Zhang attended a conference in Guangzhou as VP of Fuxin Hengtong (wholly-owned 
subsidiary of Tianhe):

That same year, Mr. Zhang co-authored a paper with Mr. David Flanigan, a US scientist who works for 
Tianhe and is credited with building the Company’s technical capabilities.

 This paper was written on 


behalf of Fuxin Hengtong and presented at the Fluorochemical Development Application Summit held in 
Chingdao on 4 June and 5 June, 2008.

Then in October 2009, Mr. Zhang attended another conference in Shanghai, this time as the CEO of 
Shanghai Top (another one of Tianhe’s ‘independent’ customer discussed infra): 
 


 
           Source: chem.wzu.edu.cn/UploadFile/20092705112754.doc  


 
 
We even found a short paper written and published by Mr. Zhang of Shanghai Top:
43 
 


And finally, our sources were told by a former customer of Shanghai Top that during their two year 
business relationship (2010-2012), their main contact was Mr. Zhang Silang. The source even provided 
an old business card of Mr. Zhang back when he only held the position of Vice President at Shanghai 
Top: 
 


 
 
 
 
So, who does Mr. Zhang work for? 
 


A) Tianhe 
B) Xidatong 
C) Shanghai Top 


 
The answer appears to be D) All of the above.  
 
 
        The Many Roles of Mr. Zhang Silang 


Timeline Position 


2006 CEO Xidatong 


2008 VP of Fuxin Hengtong (Tianhe) 


2009 CEO of Shanghai Top 


2010-2012 VP of Shanghai Top 


2014 CEO of Xidantong, attended the Investec conference call to promote Tianhe
44 
 


However, the overlap doesn’t end with Mr. Zhang.  
 
According to SAIC filings, Xidatong is 65% owned by an individual named Ms. Wang Xidi (Chinese: 


王锡娣), who is also Xidatong’s board supervisor. Several former Tianhe employees explained that Ms. 
Wang Xidi was in charge of Tianhe’s LOA business as recently as 2012. 
  


 
 Source: SAIC filings 
 
 
So here we have Xidatong, a company that: 
 


 has a CEO that was/is simultaneously a top-level executive at Tianhe 


 has a CEO that was/is the CEO/VP of Shanghai Top, another major Tianhe customer 


 is 65% owned by someone who used to run Tianhe’s LOA business as recently as 2012 


 has a registered address at an abandoned housing community 


 has an address on its website that leads to an office where no one has heard of Xidatong. 


 is a small, thinly capitalized company that in no reasonable way could be the material customer 
Tianhe claims, as evidenced by SAIC filings. 


 
 
Between Mr. Zhang and Ms. Wang’s high-level involvement in Tianhe and other key customers, it’s clear 
that Xidatong is not an independent customer by any conceivable definition of the word. Moreover, 
SAIC filings show that Xidatong is a small company and that Tianhe’s sales to Xidatong could not possibly 
be what has been claimed.
45 
 


Customer: Shanghai Top 
 
During Tianhe’s IPO marketing process, investors were told that Shanghai Top was one of Tianhe’s 
largest customers and accounted for approximately 15% of SFC revenue. This translates to revenue of 
RMB446 million in 2013 and RMB363 million in 2012. 
 
SAIC filings show that in reality, Shanghai Top is small enterprise that is actually losing money. According 
to its filings, Shanghai Top lost RMB529 thousand on revenue of RMB13 million in 2012: 
 
 
Shanghai Top 2012 SAIC Income Statement 
Revenue: RMB13 million (US$2M) 
CoGS: RMB13 million (US$2M) 
Net Income: -RMB529 thousand (-US$85K)
46 
 


Likewise, its balance sheet confirms that Shanghai Top has minimal assets. It is inconceivable that 
Shanghai Top could have conducted tens of millions worth of business with Tianhe while only having 
US$59,000 in cash and minimal inventory: 
 
 
 
Shanghai Top 2012 SAIC Balance Sheet 
Cash: RMB374 thousand (US$59K) 
Inventory: RMB2 million (US$317K)
47 
 


Furthermore, we sent a team to visit Shanghai Top at its registered address (this address can also be 
seen on Mr. Zhang Silan’s business card on page 43): 
  


上海市闵行区莘庄工业园春东路479号C2幢3楼 
 


 
 
 
During the site visit, our team was surprised to learn that Xidatong and Shanghai Top shared the same 
office and operated as one company until Xidatong moved away in 2013. 
 
We suspect that Xidatong was moved ahead of Tianhe’s IPO in order to create the illusion of an 
additional customer.
48 
 


In addition to Mr. Zhang’s deep involvement as noted previously, we found more undisclosed 
connections between Shanghai Top and Tianhe. SAIC filings show that Shanghai Top’s legal 


representative until 2011 was Jimmy Chen (陈介宏/陈玠宏). On 21 January 2011, the legal 


representative was changed from Jimmy Chen to an individual named Ms. Feng (卓淑凤). We suspect 
Ms. Feng is related to Mr. Chen because the BVI holding entity (Abound Fortune Limited) was left 
unchanged.  
 
 
 


 
 
 
Who is Jimmy Chen? 
 
According to the IPO prospectus, Jimmy Chen is a “Taiwanese consultant” and 4.5% shareholder of 
Tianhe.


25
 During the IPO roadshow, a lot of investors seemed confused as to why a “Taiwanese 


consultant” was given shares of Tianhe. As explained in the prospectus, the establishment of Fuxin 
Hengtong back in 2004 was the result of co-operation among the Wei Family (majority owners), Mr. 
Chen and a group of US scientists. Mr. Chen was ultimately given a 4.5% stake in Tianhe for introducing 
the Wei Family to the US scientists who built Tianhe’s technical capabilities.


26
 


 
What the prospectus does not disclose is that Jimmy Chen’s contribution to Tianhe was more than just 
introducing US scientists – as evidenced by the SAIC filings, he is also directly responsible for one of 
Tianhe’s largest ‘independent’ customers.

Customer: Heilongjiang Taina 
 
During the IPO roadshow, Mr. Sun Deqing of Heilongjiang Taina was brought in to provide customer 
verification to potential investors.


27
 Taina was presented to investors as one of Tianhe’s largest 


customers, having purchased approximately RMB300 million worth of SFC in 2013 and 2012. This 
translates to approximately 10% of Tianhe’s SFC sales. 
 
Despite what the dreamweavers at Tianhe claim, SAIC filings show that Taina is relatively modest 
company that generated net income of RMB2 million on revenue of RMB72 million in 2012: 
 
 
Heilongjiang Taina 2012 SAIC Income Statement 
Revenue: RMB72 million (US$11.4M) 
CoGS: RMB63 million (US$10M) 
Net Income: RMB2 million (US$317K) 
 





                                                           
27


 ICBC conference call on 23 May 2014
50 
 


Likewise, the balance sheet confirms that Taina does not have the capital to buy RMB300 million worth 
of SFC products from Tianhe, having only RMB1.7 million in cash and RMB10 million in inventory: 
 
 
Heilongjiang Taina 2012 SAIC Balance Sheet 
Cash: RMB1.7 million (US$270K) 
Inventory: RMB10 million (US$1.5M)
51 
 


The question of its modest financial position aside, Taina also shares links with Tianhe and its other 
customers. According to SAIC filings, Taina is 85% owned by Mr. Sun Deqing: 
 


 
 
 
On its own, Mr. Sun’s majority ownership of Taina doesn’t mean anything. However, we found that Mr. 
Sun is also the chairman of a company named Taifu. The following is a picture of Mr. Sun hosted by his 
Alma Mater, the Material Science and Engineering College on 15 May 2014, where he was presented as 
the Chairman of Taifu: 
 


 
                        Source: http://news.qqhru.edu.cn/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=37467 
 
 



http://news.qqhru.edu.cn/Article/ShowArticle.asp?ArticleID=37467
52 
 


And what is Taifu?  
 
To answer that question, we sent a team to Taifu’s registered address in Shanghai and this is what we 
found:  
 


(上海市嘉定区菊园新区环城路2222号 (嘉乐园商务大厦) 1205室) 
 
 





Taifu, as it turns out, is a company that shares an office with the very elusive Xidatong. Of all the gin 
joints in all the towns in all the world – what are the odds? 
 
It appears that Xidatong and Shanghai Top operated as one company prior to Tianhe’s IPO. In 
anticipation of the IPO, Xidatong was split and had to establish its own office to create the illusion of an 
additional customer. It seems then that Xidatong set up a shared office with Taifu, which is chaired by 
the same man that controls Taina, another of Tianhe’s customers. One would think that with the 
purported multi-million dollar chemical empires these customers run they could afford their own 
separate offices. Apparently not. 
 
The number of undisclosed related parties, shared offices, and overlapping management between 
Tianhe and its major customers is extensive. This is not how real, independent customers and businesses 
operate. Indeed, the SAIC filings make clear that these customers only have minimal business operations 
and could not conduct business at the scope and size claimed by Tianhe. We suspect that real value of 
these “customers” comes from acting as counterparty and transacting with Tianhe on paper in order to 
satisfy the auditors.
53 
 


Summary: the Intertwined Web of Xidatong, Shanghai Top and Taina 
 


 Tianhe named its 2
nd


, 3
rd


, and 4
th


 largest SFC customers as Xidatong, Shanghai Top and Taina 
during the IPO roadshow. In fact, we have shown that these customers are interconnected, 
related, and not credible. 


 
 
Shanghai Xidatong 
 


 Xidatong was named Tianhe’s 2
nd


 largest SFC customer. Mr. Zhang Silang was brought in as the 
CEO of Xidatong to provide customer verification in support of Tianhe on a conference call 
hosted by Investec on 16 May 2014. 


 Background checks show that Mr. Zhang has been the CEO of Xidatong going as far back as 
2006. However, in that time frame he has also been a top-level executive at Tianhe and 
Shanghai Top.  


 SAIC filings show that Xidatong is a small, thinly capitalized company that cannot possibly 
conduct business in the amounts claimed. Its registered address is an abandoned housing 
community. 


 Xidatong is 65% owned by an individual named Ms. Wang Xidi (Chinese: 王锡娣). According to 
several former Tianhe employees, Ms. Wang Xidi was in charge of Tianhe’s LOA business as 
recently as 2012. 


 Based on information from site visits, Xidatong and Shanghai Top used to share on office and 
effectively operate as one company until sometime in 2013 when Xidatong moved. 
 
 


Shanghai Top 
 


 Shanghai Top was named Tianhe’s 3
rd


 largest SFC customer. SAIC filings show that in reality 
Shanghai Top is only a modest enterprise that is losing money and would be unable to conduct 
business of the size claimed. 


 Our investigation shows that Shanghai Top shares overlapping management with Xidatong and 
Tianhe, namely Mr. Zhang Silang. Moreover, Shanghai Top’s legal representative until 2011 was 
Jimmy Chen, a shareholder and notable key individual of Tianhe. 


 
 
Heilongjiang Taina 
 


 Taina was named Tianhe’s 4
th


 largest SFC customer. Mr. Sun Deqing owns 85% of Taina and was 
brought in to provide customer verification to potential investors on behalf of Tianhe. 


 Background checks show that Mr. Deqing is the chairman of a previously unknown company 
named Taifu. A visit to Taifu’s registered address shows that it shares an office with Xidatong. 


 SAIC filings show that Taina is a small company and does not have the capital or financial 
resources to carry out business of the size claimed.
54 
 


Customer: CITIC International 
 
According to Tianhe, CITIC International accounted for sales of RMB829 million in 2011, RMB953 million 
in 2012, and RMB1.5 billion in 2013.


28
 Tianhe’s own SAIC filings show that total Company revenue only 


reached RMB645 million in 2012, making Tianhe’s claims that it sold RMB675 million to CITIC 
International that year highly unlikely. 
 
Moreover, it’s important to distinguish between CITIC International (Tianhe’s customer), and CITIC 
Group, the sprawling SOE conglomerate that generally springs to mind. The distinction here is an 
important one. 
 
On the website of CITIC Bank – the Hong Kong and China listed entity – we found a related party 
transaction announcement that describes CITIC Group, noting that in 2009, CITIC Group generated 
revenue of RMB209 billion and net profit of RMB35.4 billion: 
 


 
 
 
By contrast, the same announcement also describes CITIC International in detail, noting that it 
generated revenue of RMB1.31 billion and net profit of RMB29 million in 2009: 
 





 
From this announcement, we can see that CITIC International is just a tiny subsidiary within a giant 
conglomerate. Given this, it would take a feat of mental gymnastics to assume that while CITIC 
International only generated revenue of RMB1.31 billion in 2009, it purchased RMB829 million worth of 
chemicals from Tianhe in 2011 and even more in subsequent years. This assumption becomes even 
more unrealistic when we consider that CITIC International’s business consists of domestic trading, 
exporting, and importing.

55 
 


CITIC International’s size aside, its official website makes no mention of trading in SFC chemicals, either 
domestically or internationally.


29
 On the domestic side, CITIC’s trading business is mainly limited to 


stainless steel and textile raw materials. On the export side, the website notes that it deals in fine 
chemicals, but makes no mention of SFC chemicals (which are an entirely different beast from fine 
chemicals).


30
  


 
Clicking on CITIC International’s various business departments provides a list of products that particular 
department exports and imports. For example, the 1


st
 business department is focused of chemical 


exports, but again, these exports are only named as LOA products and medicine intermediates 
(presumably fine chemicals): 
 


 
Source: http://www.intl.citic.com/iwcm/zxgjsmyxgs/en/ns:LHQ6MTIsZjozNCxjOixwOixhOixtOg==/channel.vsml 
 
 


Our sources interviewed multiple manufacturers and distributors of SFC chemicals, and none of them 
were aware that CITIC International is involved in the SFC business in any form. This information was 
also corroborated through interviews with former employees of CITIC International. One former 
employee explained that CITIC International exports fluorite, which is used in the production of SFCs, 
but not SFC chemicals themselves (the 1


st
 business department is in charge of exporting fluorite). Based 


on these interviews as well as website information, we suspect Tianhe is extensively fabricating its 
relationship with CITIC International. 
 
Notably, during the IPO marketing process, Tianhe brought in executives from Xidatong and Taina to 
issue customer verification, but did not bring in anyone from CITIC International, which is purportedly 
their largest customer.

During the IPO roadshow, investors had a lot of questions about how it was possible for Tianhe to 
achieve its financial results. These type of questions are understandable because Tianhe’s reported 
results seems unreal – If true, Tianhe has far surpassed industry trends by growing revenue more than 
20% annually, while simultaneously reporting net margins north of 50%. 
 
Management’s answer to appropriately skeptical investors is that they have a secret weapon: Anti-mar. 
 
Tianhe claims to produce and sell anti-mar (anti-fingerprint) agents in commercial quantities. Anti-mar is 
an agent applied primarily to touch panels used in smartphones and tablets to make them smear and 
fingerprint resistant.  
 
Anti-mar is an incredibly expensive substance, and by weight, pure anti-mar is far more expensive than 
gold. Management told investors that Tianhe sells one ton of 100% pure anti-mar for approximately 
RMB130 million (US$20M). This is actually cheap, because price checks with Daikin and Shinetsu show 
that the average selling price of anti-mar is RMB100 million for one ton of 20% concentrate (20% 
concentrate is industry standard).


31
 Daikin and Shinetsu are both Japanese companies that are 


acknowledged to dominate the anti-mar market.  
 
Management told investors that Tianhe sold 8 tons of 100% pure anti-mar in 2013. Tianhe’s anti-mar 
sales are reported on its income statement as part of ‘downstream specialty fluorochemical products’. 
This segment has seemingly come out of nowhere and exploded since 2011. In 2013, RMB1 billion (60%) 
of this line item came from the sale of anti-mar agents (8 tons of anti-mar @ RMB130 million per ton): 
 
       Exhibit 7 
       Tianhe Revenue Segments 


 
       Source: http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0609/LTN20140609007.pdf pg. 212 
 
While anti-mar sales only contributed to 20% of Company-wide revenue in 2013, ‘downstream specialty 
fluorochemical products’ is by far Tianhe’s fastest growing line item. More important than sales growth, 
the gross margin on anti-mar is in the neighborhood of 90%, which means the 20% revenue contribution 
has a wildly disproportionate effect on the Company’s net income.

The Anti-Mar Market 



http://www.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/SEHK/2014/0609/LTN20140609007.pdf

http://daikin-america.com/docs/OPTOOL%20DSX.pdf
57 
 


Given anti-mar’s importance to Tianhe, we dedicated substantial time to analyzing and researching the 
anti-mar market over the span of several months. We talked to industry experts, consulted application 
manuals, and engaged a highly qualified outside firm to conduct research into the industry. Combined, 
sources along the entire anti-mar supply chain were interviewed, including Daikin, Biel, Lens One, TPK, 
Wintek, and XinXin. We are confident that we have spent more time and resources than any investment 
bank or analyst in fully understanding the anti-mar market – and all our collective research shows that 
Tianhe’s claims of selling 8 tons of pure anti-mar in 2013 is fiction. 
 
First, Tianhe claims that 4 out of the 8 tons of pure anti-mar were sold to Xidatong. Our investigation 
into Xidatong, as well as a review of its SAIC filings has already provided ample evidence that Xidatong is 
neither an independent customer nor has the capital to buy 4 tons of pure anti-mar. But even if we 
suspend disbelief and assume that Xidatong is the real, independent customer that Tianhe claims, it is 
highly unlikely that there would be enough global demand to absorb Tianhe’s 8 tons of pure anti-mar.   
 
Here is how the math works: 
 
Management told investors that 1 gram of anti-mar can be applied to 200 iPhones. To verify this claim, 
our sources contacted two touch panel vendors who are suppliers to Fujitsu and Samsung who stated 
that that 1 gram of anti-mar can be applied to 150 iPhones. We also contacted a sales manager from 
Daikin and an expert from IHS who further confirmed these numbers. More specifically, the experts 
noted that when they are talking about 1 gram of anti-mar, they are referring to 20% concentrate which 
is the industry standard. Daikin and Shinetsu both ship anti-mar in 20% concentrate.


32
  


 
Another source of verification is an online product catalogue referencing Shinetsu, which states that the 
cost of applying anti-mar is around RMB0.5-0.6 per touch panel using spray coating: 
 





Shinetsu sells anti-mar at 20% concentrate for RMB100 million per ton. At a cost of RMB0.5-RMB0.6 per 
touch panel, that means 1 gram of anti-mar can be applied to between 167-200 iPhones, which once 
again is consistent with other sources.  
 
For our purposes, we will use the midpoint and assume that 1 gram of 20% concentrate anti-mar can be 
applied to 175 iPhones.

To calculate world demand, we can start with Apple. An iPhone screen has a surface area of 11.25 
square inches (2.31in x 4.87in), while an iPad screen has the surface area of 62.04 square inches (6.6in x 
9.4in). Therefore, the surface area of an iPad is equivalent to 5.5 iPhones (62.04 ÷ 11.25). 
 


 
 Source: www.apple.com 
 
 
In 2013, Apple sold 154 million iPhones and 74 million iPads globally.


33
 In terms of surface area, this is 


the equivalent of selling 566 million iPhones (154M + [74 x 5.5]). 
 
There are 1 million grams in a metric ton. Given that 1 gram of 20% concentrate anti-mar can be applied 
to 175 iPhones, it means that 566 million iPhone equivalents would require 3.2 tons of anti-mar at 20% 
concentrate. This is the total amount of anti-mar required for all the iPhones and iPads sold in 2013.  
 
From here, we can move beyond Apple and extrapolate global anti-mar demand for the entire 
smartphone and tablet industry. 
 
According to IDC data, 1 billion smartphones and 217 million tablets were shipped globally in 2013.


34‚35 


In terms of surface area, this is the equivalent of shipping 2.2 billion smartphones (1B + [217M x 5.5]). 
Assuming the same math as above, 2.2 billion smartphone equivalents – the global shipment of all 
smartphones and tablets in 2013 – would require 12.5 tons of anti-mar at 20% concentrate.

Furthermore, according to IHS, approximately 63.5% of the touch panel market is used in smartphones 
and tablets. The other 36.5% of market applications includes touch screen notebooks and LCD 
monitors.


36
 Therefore, we have to adjust our 12.5 ton figure to 19.7 tons (12.5 ÷ 0.635) to include all 


other touch panels produced in 2013. 
 
Finally, industry experts tell us that at least 10% of touch panels do not use anti-mar, usually because 
the final product is of low quality and cheaply priced. Accordingly, we would need to adjust our 19.7 
tons figure down by 10%. However, this is balanced by the fact that industry experts tell us that while 
90% of the anti-mar market is used in the application of touch panels, the remaining 10% of the market 
is mostly applied to eyeglass lenses. These two adjustments cancel out and we can conclude that total 
global demand for anti-mar in 2013 stood at approximately 19.7 tons of 20% concentrate, or nearly 4 
tons of 100% pure concentrate.

In this context, Tianhe’s claims of having sold 8 tons of pure anti-mar in 2013 become untethered from 
reality, and imply that Tianhe effectively sold anti-mar equal to 200% of global demand, by our 
estimates. Moreover, this would mean that Tianhe is by far the largest supplier of anti-mar in the world, 
outstripping market leaders Daikin and Shinetsu.  
 
On the other hand, when our sources conducted expert interviews with Daikin, they were told that 
Tianhe is not even a supplier of anti-mar, but rather a supplier of far less valuable solvents used by 
distributors to dilute anti-mar concentrate. These solvents are priced at around RMB300,000 per ton. 
This information was confirmed by former Tianhe employees who stated that the “anti-mar” product 
Tianhe referred to internally was priced at RMB300,000 per ton and is in fact a fluorine-contained 
solvent for anti-mar finished products. 
 
Sources also believe that it would be impossible for Tianhe to have sold 8 tons of pure anti-mar without 
the industry having heard about it. As we have shown, 8 tons of pure anti-mar is substantially more than 
global demand. 
 
Based on our research, we find it unlikely that Tianhe has the capabilities to produce anti-mar 
commercially or the demand to sell 8 tons of pure substance. Adding further doubt to its claims is that 
Tianhe has never named a single end-user of its anti-mar agent. 
 
By our estimates, Tianhe’s purported sale of 1RMB billion worth of anti-mar represents 30-35% of its 
operating income – all of which we believe has been fabricated.

Comparison of Daikin vs. Tianhe 
 
A simple way of debunking Tianhe’s anti-mar claims is to compare its reported sales to Daikin. According 
to industry experts, Daikin is acknowledged to dominate the anti-mar market with 60% market share, 
followed by Shinetsu, Dow Corning and Dupont who effectively share the other 40%. In our own market 
research and the market research of our outside consultant, Tianhe’s name never came up as a visible 
anti-mar supplier. In fact, the only time Tianhe’s name came up was only to mention that Tianhe is not 
an anti-mar supplier. 
 
Furthermore, most anti-mar demand comes from China where the majority of smartphones/tablets are 
manufactured. Biel Crystal was named as consuming 57% of the world’s anti-mar coating material. Biel 
supplies touch panels to Samsung, Apple, and Lenovo. In second place, Lens One was named as 
consuming 37% of the world’s anti-mar coating material. Lens supplies touch panels to Apple, Samsung, 
HTC, and Huawei. Both Biel and Lens have substantial production in China and experts tell us that the 
majority of their anti-mar comes from Daikin and Shinetsu. 
 
In 2013, Daikin’s total chemical sales in China were RMB2.03 billion.


37
 After adjusting for FX fluctuations, 


Daikin’s chemical sales in China have effectively remained flat between 2011 and 2013. Notably, Daikin 
states in its financial summary that sales to existing customers of anti-fouling (anti-mar) coating in China 
and Asia were sluggish in 2013.


38
 


 
By contrast, during the same time period, Tianhe’s downstream SFC product revenue – the line item 
which consists mostly of anti-mar sales – has exploded:

            (FX adjusted - RMB millions) 


 
           Source: company financial statements 


 
We are skeptical that Tianhe, a relatively new company with no disclosed end-users has grown so fast in 
the last three years that it downstream SFC segment alone has effectively caught up with Daikin’s entire 
China chemical division.

To be fair, it’s also possible that Daikin sells its anti-mar through Japanese distributors before it gets 
shipped to China, in which case revenue would be recognized in Japan. However, Daikin’s Japan 
chemical sales in 2013 were comparable to its China chemical sales at RMB2.3 billion.


39
  


 
Even if we combine ALL of Daikin’s chemical sales in Japan and China in 2013 (RMB4.3 billion), it still 
wouldn’t lend any sense to Tianhe’s claimed anti-mar sales of ~RMB1 billion. 
 
Just to put things in perspective: most of the world’s anti-mar supply is consumed in China. Daikin is 
widely acknowledged to dominate 60% of the anti-mar market, while Tianhe is a virtual unknown. Even 
still, Tianhe’s claimed anti-mar sales equal nearly a quarter of ALL of Daikin’s combined chemical sales in 
China and Japan.

Research and Development 
 
Expert interviews and industry research aside, there are other reasons to doubt Tianhe’s anti-mar 
claims. Big manufacturers including Apple, LG, and Lenovo have very strict certification requirements 
which make it unlikely that they would change suppliers to a newcomer like Tianhe. These 
manufacturers work directly with their big-name suppliers to constantly improve and develop their 
performance chemicals. Products are fast changing and chemical suppliers need extremely high R&D 
capabilities to keep pace.


40
 


 
In that context, we find it questionable that in both absolute and relative terms, Tianhe spends almost 
no money on R&D. Exhibit 9 presents R&D expenses as a percent of revenue for Tianhe and other SFC 
competitors. While most industry players spend between 2% to 5% of revenue on R&D, Tianhe spends 
0.2%. In fact, Tianhe’s spending is so small that we had to stretch this graph to make it visible: 
 
Exhibit 9 
Industry R&D Spending as % of Revenue 


 
Source: annual reports 


 
Throughout the IPO marketing process, Management made a big deal of having retained three US 
scientists led by Dr. David Flanigan to develop Tianhe’s technical capabilities.


41
 In return for their 


services, the US team was given a 5.33% equity stake in Tianhe back in 2006. As of this writing, that 
stake was worth quite a bit, and it is possible to look at the equity offering as a substantial one-time 
payment in lieu of annual R&D expenses.


42
 


 
Mr. Flanigan and his colleagues have been held out to be highly qualified scientist. Mr. Flanigan himself 
worked as a consultant to DuPont for a decade before joining Tianhe.


43
 But here’s the catch: even 


though Mr. Flanigan worked for DuPont, DuPont still spends 6% of its revenue on R&D annually. This is 
despite the fact that the value of DuPont’s intangible assets + goodwill is 19% of total assets, whereas 
for Tianhe it is closer to 2%. DuPont, and all the other chemical companies in the world continuously 
spend substantial amounts on R&D just to keep them competitive and developing new products.

Considering that Mr. Flanigan lives in Colorado,
44


 we find it unlikely that he has the time or the presence 
to fully dedicate himself to the evolving needs of Tianhe’s customers. An internet search shows that Mr. 
Flanigan’s time is spent on other projects, including running his own consulting firm.


45
  We find it hard to 


believe that one man who lives half a world away and two of his colleagues – no matter how 
experienced – can act as substitute for the annual R&D spending of a US$8 billion company.

Throughout our research, we found that the source most consistent with Tianhe’s claims was Tianhe’s 
own prospectus.  
 
In preparing its prospectus, Tianhe retained a research firm named Frost & Sulliven (“F&S”) to provide 
business, industry, and company-specific data. As an example, the prospectus cites F&S when stating 
that the anti-mar market in 2013 was worth US$2.6 billion.


46
 If the anti-mar market was indeed that big, 


Tianhe’s claims of having sold 8 tons of pure anti-mar would be plausible. However, our own substantial 
research shows that the anti-mar market in 2013 was only valued at US$0.3 billion (RMB1.97 billion).


47
 


 
The prospectus relies heavily on data from F&S as evidenced by the 113 references to “Frost & Sullivan”. 
By comparison, the word “Tianhe” appears 200 times. In turn, sell-side analysts refer to F&S data in their 
own research reports. For example: 
 


 Goldman Sachs (“Buy” rating on Tianhe) refers to F&S 30 times in its initial report. 


 Bank of America ML (“Buy” rating on Tianhe) refers to F&S 24 times in its initial report. 


 BOC International (“Buy” rating on Tianhe) refers to F&S 16 times in its initial report. 
 
With such heavy reliance on F&S for everything from industry metrics to company-specific market share 
data, one would expect F&S to be an independent, unbiased research firm that conducts rigorous due 
diligence for the benefit of potential investors. However, according to the marketing material we 
received, F&S appears to be more of a public relations company than an independent research firm. For 
example, here is one slide from their marketing material:

We find it dubious that F&S sells itself to issuers as being instrumental to “investor confidence building 
measures” and “pre-empting investor concerns”. Such implied support for issuers certainly calls into 
question F&S’ objectivity. In any case, our favorite part of the marketing material is that F&S goes on to 
give a case study of an IPO it supported: 
 
        F&S Case Study 


 
         
 
F&S is either so robust of ego or so completely removed from reality that they chose to showcase their 
work on China Zaino (now named Dapai International Holdings) as marketing material.  For those who 
aren’t aware, China Zaino was part of a wave of Singapore-listed Chinese frauds that saw its stock price 
collapse to zero. If F&S had updated China Zaino’s graph on its presentation, it would look something 
like this: 
 


 
 
It’s unfortunate that Tianhe needs to resort to littering its prospectus with garbage from F&S to validate 
its claims.
66 
 


 
 
We believe that the totality of the evidence shows that Tianhe has vastly misrepresented the size and 
scope of its business, and has produced false and misleading statements to the market.   
 
All the evidence we have reviewed and relied upon in forming our views is publicly available, and set out 
in our report – it’s what an honest and authentic due diligence exercise looks like, and the crime here is 
compounded by the fact that so many relevant parties have been at best negligent and derelict, and at 
worst guilty of false statements and fraud, in carrying out their duties related to the IPO.   
 
We believe that the Securities & Futures Commission and the Hong Kong Stock Exchange will quickly 
verify the evidence we have presented herein and halt trading of Tianhe’s stock. Thereafter, we expect 
that regulators will delist Tianhe and prosecute the executives and promoters responsible for this fraud.
