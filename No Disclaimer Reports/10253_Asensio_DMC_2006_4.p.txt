DMC: A Long History of Silly,


Fruitless Litigation


In a David vs. Goliath-like battle, everyone roots for the


underdog. In any case where the validity and enforceability


of the Wicker Patents is concerned (AMEX: DMC, $8.65) this


has proven to be a losing bet. The Wicker Patents are the


patents that comprise the portfolio of patented technology


that DMC claims to own and were developed by Ralph


Wicker. The past unsuccessful legal history of the Wicker


Patents should be of great concern to DMC as they are


currently embroiled in a patent infringement lawsuit with the


European Central Bank (“ECB”), which in turn sued DMC


claiming its patents are invalid.


In a case �led by the Wickers, claiming that two of The


Standard Register Company’s (“Standard”) patents were


invalid due to obviousness and incorrect inventorship, the


Wickers were not just unsuccessful, but the Court found


them to have engaged in “willful infringement” of Standard’s


patents and �ned them $50,000. On December 02, 1994


Ralph Wicker d/b/a the Wicker Group �led suit against


Standard in the United States District for the Eastern Circuit


of Virginia alleging that Standard’s Patents Number


4,227,720 (“720”) and 4,310,180 (“180”) were invalid due to


obviousness and incorrect inventorship.

Standard’s counterclaims alleged “willful infringement” of the


720 and 180 patents by the Wicker Group. In a decision that


was a�rmed by the Court of Appeals the jury found the


Patents were not to be invalidated due to obviousness or


incorrect inventorship and the Wicker Group was in fact


willfully infringing upon the Standard Patents and Standard


was awarded $50,000 dollars in damages.


Ironically, in a case brought by the Wickers against the


United States of America in 1995 for infringement of two of


the Wicker Patents the Court ruled that upon further review


claims of these Wicker Patents were in fact “obvious in light


of prior art” and ordered those claims invalidated. In 1995


Ralph Wicker, Thomas Wicker, and SMW Patent Corporation


�led a lawsuit alleging that the United States Treasury


Department had infringed upon Ralph Wicker’s United States


Patent Numbers 5,018,767 (“767”) and 5,193,853 (“853”) by


manufacturing and distributing the $100 bill unveiled in


1995.


On March 13, 2000 the United States Court of Appeals for


the Federal Circuit a�rmed a decision by the Court of


Federal Claims. According to the decision authored by Circuit


Judge Gajarsa “The Court of Federal Claims found that the


United States in fact was infringing the patents. However,


the trial court also determined that the claims of both


patents were invalid as obvious over the prior art, i.e., British


Patent No. 1,138,011 and [*2] German Patent DE 3,602,563


C1 in particular, under 35 U.S.C. § 103 (1994).”


Both the 853 and 767 Patent were allowed to expire “due to


failure to pay maintenance fees,” with only the 767 Patent


being reinstated in March 2004 after expiring in May 2003.


The Wicker’s legal history further became a losing cause


when an injunction was granted to stop the Wickers from


licensing technology that had already been exclusively


licensed. On July 12, 1996 the New York Supreme Court


issued a preliminary injunction enjoining and restraining Privacy  - Terms

Ralph, Thomas, David, Christine and Mary Wicker (“Wicker


Group”) from violating, breaching and or repudiating the


terms of its Management Agreement and Licensing


Agreement with Secured Document Systems, Inc. (“SDS”).


The technology had been licensed in a June 9, 1994


Management Agreement in which the Wicker Group named


SDS the sole Licensing Agent for its patents and trade


secrets.


In October 1996, only three months later, Thomas Wicker


again willfully violated the SDS Management and Licensing


Agreements as well as the recently ordered Court injunction.


Continuous Forms and Checks, Inc., Wolf International, Inc.,


Thomas W. Wicker Enterprises, Inc, (“TWE”) Robert L. Lenox,


Casey Campbell and Latitude 49 Business and Security


Systems, L.L.C. together formed Optical Deterrent Systems


L.L.C. (“ODS”).


On October 28, 1996 ODS executed a Technology License


Agreement in which Thomas M. Wicker represented that he


had assigned his rights in technology covered by the Court


injunction to TWE which then granted to ODS an exclusive,


perpetual and irrevocable license to utilize the technology.


The ODS Licensing Agreement was executed when Thomas


Wicker was under the restraint of an injunction which


speci�cally barred him from assigning the technology in the


ODS Agreement and therefore voided the agreement.


On August 1, 2005, in its latest David vs. Goliath adventure


DMC �led a lawsuit against the ECB in the European Court of


First Instance alleging that Euro banknotes infringe upon


DMC’s European Patent No 044750B1 (“EP 750”). As of April


27, 2006 the ECB has �led counter claims in eight countries


arguing that DMC’s EP ‘750 should be invalidated. The


countries in which counterclaims have been �led are:


Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, the


Netherlands, and the United Kingdom, with an imminent


�ling by Spain anticipated. Privacy  - Terms

This does not bode well for DMC as the nulli�cation of


patents by a governing body is not a new theme to DMC. In


the lawsuit against the United States, the Court reversed the


opinion of the United States Patent and Trade O�ce and


invalidated claims of the DMC patents in question. The


nuances here should not be lost on DMC shareholders. A


branch of the governing body that had initially issued DMC


its patent has now sued DMC for invalidity of the same


patent.


In the original story, David took down Goliath with a sling-


shot. DMC shareholders are now holding on to the slender


sliver of hope that the large stones that the Company’s


management are now swinging are more potent than they


have proven to be in the past.
