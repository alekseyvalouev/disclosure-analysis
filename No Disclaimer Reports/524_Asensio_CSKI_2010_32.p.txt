CSKI Erroneously Touts Its “High Ethical
Standards” while NASDAQ Continues Its
Supposed Listing Review.


Posted on January 7, 2010 by Asensio.com


On January 4th China Sky One Medical, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSKI) issued


a press release stating that its stock listing had been moved to the


NASDAQ Global Select Market. CSKI referred to the Global Select


Market as having “the highest financial listing standards in the


world.” CSKI also referred to the listing as “a mark of achievement,


leadership, credibility, and high ethical standards.”


However, a review of NASDAQ listing requirements shows that


there are no more stringent due diligence procedures or corporate


governance standards involved in a “Global Select” tier listing.


There appears to be only one corporate governance standard


required for listing on any tier of the NASDAQ exchange.


A company can move to the Global Select Market from a lower


NASDAQ tier based mainly on its reported earnings and equity


market value. NASDAQ will upgrade a company automatically if it


meets the reported criteria without any further independent


review.


Based on NASDAQ’s disclosed criteria, CSKI’s statement that the


listing shows a “high ethical standard” seems unwarranted and


disingenuous.


CSKI could show a greater devotion to a “high ethical standard” by


resolving some of the company’s many problematic issues


described in previous asensio.com reports, such as financial


statements filed with the Chinese government that do not reconcile


with its SEC filings, reported inventory levels that are incredibly


low, and gross margins that are inconsistent with its own reported

changes in product mix. The company could also retain an auditor


with a less problematic history than Moore Stephens.


Yesterday NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: NDAQ) issued a


press release stating that 33 Chinese companies listed on NASDAQ


in 2009, the most of any U.S. exchange, and that a total of 124


Chinese companies are now listed on NASDAQ.


asensio.com recently issued three reports (see reports 1, 2, and 3)


detailing problems in NASDAQ’s listing oversight, especially in


connection with Chinese reverse mergers and NASDAQ’s former


chief representative in China, Xu Guangxun, who left the company


suddenly last year. The current head of NASDAQ’s listing


investigations department, Gary Sundick, was also involved in the


oversight problems with Pegasus Wireless Corporation, which


asensio.com reported on in 2006 when it was listed on the NASDAQ.


The SEC filed a complaint against Pegasus and its former executives


detailing fraud charges in 2009.


Given the investor-protection concerns surrounding Chinese


reverse mergers and CSKI in particular, investors should hope that


Mr. Sundick is fulfilling his oversight duties and reviewing CSKI’s


claims.


Rather than touting a fundamentally meaningless listing change,


CSKI might consider providing investors with disclosures related to


the consulting work done by Pricewaterhouse Coopers on ‘the


financial reporting and control requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley


Act.’ As previously reported by asensio.com, CSKI made numerous


efforts to tout its engagement of Pricewaterhouse, not as an auditor,


but as a consultant. asensio.com contacted executives at


Pricewaterhouse responsible for Sarbanes-Oxley consulting, but


they would not provide comment on CSKI, nor would they comment


on the problematic nature of consulting on auditing issues for a


client that they have not audited themselves.
