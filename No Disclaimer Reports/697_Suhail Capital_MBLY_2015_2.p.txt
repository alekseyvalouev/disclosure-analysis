Mobileye: Tesla/GeoHot Controversy Just The Tip Of The Iceberg

Summary


The Tesla/GeoHot Incident is largely irrelevant to near-term operating business, but
puts major dent in technological mystique around the name.


GeoHot, Autopilot, and other developments leading us to believe semi-autonomous
ambitions likely to suffer setback/take back seat to full autonomous road maps.


This benefits competing technologies like LIDAR and High Precision maps which are
already seeing ramping adoption at expense of Mobileye.


Wall Street will need to rethink their out year models, and long-term asp projections
on the name.


Stock now ironically more of a valuation outlier as high growth tech IPO mania has
completely died and broader tech beta valuations have drastically come in.


Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic" - Arthur C.
Clark


Last week's Bloomberg Article on George Hotz stirred up some serious controversy in the
self-driving vehicle space. While the main controversy centered on Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)
and Mobileye's (NYSE:MBLY) supplier relationship with respect to the former's Autopilot
system, we believe this incident has opened the door to a much more interesting debate
about where this whole space is heading. As we have not commented on Mobileye since
our initial report, we thought this would be a good time to update our views on our short
thesis and address recent developments in the space.


So what's all the ruckus about?


Well, as far as the market is concerned, the main controversy centered around a
Bloomberg article/interview in which famed hacker George Hotz shared his own self-
driving hack as well as disclosed that he had been approached by Elon Musk to work on
displacing Mobileye's technology in-house at Tesla. This was followed by a tweet from
Citron Research highlighting Mobileye as their short of the year for 2016. The combination
of the two led to a prompt drop in Mobileye's stock price. The next day Tesla responded

with your expected damage control 'correction' corporate statement that took some shots
at what Hotz has accomplished, and defended their supplier relationship. This was
naturally complemented by several immediate sell-side analyst defenses of Mobileye, and
a brief but limited bounce in the share price. Pretty much your typical growth stock
controversy market scenario as far as relevant stock moving news goes. We went from a
hacker in a garage is going to displace Mobileye at Tesla and maybe bring down their
whole business on Wednesday, to what he accomplished can be done by any one of
Mobileye's CTO Professor Amnon Shashua's computer science students and that Tesla
still loves Mobileye by Thursday. That market pendulum sure loves to swing!


Now strip emotions out and let's just focus on the facts here.


1. Hotz hacked an Acura in his garage and has built some form of a functioning autopilot
that is highly AI direct perception driven in its approach, and he took direct shots at
Mobileye's technology calling it a 'joke' and 'outdated'


2. Elon Musk was impressed enough with what he's doing to offer him a job with the aim
of discontinuing Mobileye's technology at Tesla as his primary goal.


That's it as far as we are concerned.


Well, with respect to point #1, it is clear Hotz is not putting Mobileye out of business
anytime soon with his hack, and his system is so premature it would be ridiculous for
anyone to draw conclusions about Mobileye's future based on what was provided in the
interview. All we have here is the impressive work of a clearly bright and highly motivated
individual with a track record of 'figuring things out'. There is one big caveat here, and
that's that ever since Mobileye went public, Wall Street has gone out of its way to
hype up their technology. There is an aura of mystique around the company that
has at times bordered on the ridiculous. The type of ridiculous that leads to sell-
side models in which Mobileye's ASPs are double what they are today 25 years
from now! Hotz, with his public persona, just put a major dent in that mystique.
Which is ironic because there is essentially an entire industry of traditional ADAS vision
engineers who can demystify this in a few minutes. Or AI vision focused autonomous
driving experts as far away as China who make bold claims like Hotz. This is the problem
with being the very public leader in a space, and a hot tech IPO. On one end you have a
target on your back, and the other end you have people who are not satisfied just selling
your very good story. They need to create a better one. Mobileye clearly has that problem.
Their initial business model was about NOT BEING CUTTING EDGE. They took a

cheaper, quicker, we will find a way to make it work approach to get the mass market and
be the leader. Business model wise how can you fault that? But reading about 500 people
in Sri Lanka validating images doesn't sell 100x revenue stocks.


As for point #2, this story obviously would not have gotten the coverage it received if it
weren't for the fact that Hotz revealed he got Elon Musk's attention with his work. The
Tesla 'correction' which we will get to in a moment does not deny that he was offered a job
to work on replacing Mobileye with in-house developed technology. This is again not
interesting news because of any remotely material financial impact on Mobileye's
immediate business model, but because of the dent it puts into the Wall Street created
Mobileye mystique. Think about it, Tesla sells 10-15k cars a quarter, annualized that works
out to about 1% of the EyeQ chips Mobileye will ship this year. Financially speaking
Mobileye could never do business with Tesla again, and it wouldn't impact their bottom line
in the least bit. But then why was Tesla mentioned like 20 times on the last Mobileye
conference call? The answer to that question is not complicated; Tesla has the most
technological mystique of any publicly traded company in this market. Mobileye by virtue
of being a key component supplier in their autopilot system has decided to marry
themselves to that mystique. But the problem is that Tesla is Tesla, and they are not in the
business of giving anyone else credit for what they are doing. This has been clear
throughout the entire relationship as Musk has gone out of his way to emphasize the
proprietary nature of his company's self-driving ambitions (and their correction response
gets into this as they continued to stress their whole sensor suite and more importantly
that Tesla's fleet learning algo improvement has zero to do with Mobileye). Do you think
Tesla is going to dedicate the resources to replace Mobileye's tech to save 20-30$ a
chip down the road? Not a chance. Thus, to us the real notable news here is that
Hotz has confirmed what many of us already suspected, Musk thinks he can do it
better. Not exactly a shocker considering how much press Autopilot has gotten and
how outspoken he is on autonomous driving ambitions. What is shocking is that he
only offered a multi-million dollar bonus to replace the technology of a Tier 2 sensor
provider that was as of a few months ago being valued at nearly 65% of Tesla's
market capitalization.

Combine this news with Musk's tweets a few weeks ago about software hires for the
autopilot team, and you don't exactly come out with a ringing endorsement for Mobileye's
current share price. Anyway, that's our direct take on this Tony Stark-esque incident, now
onto the more interesting stuff.


Tesla's Autopilot and GeoHot's Hacked Acura Raise Much More Interesting Future
Questions About The Viability Of Semi-Autonomous Driving


Tesla's correction of the Bloomberg article emphasized the unique software nature of their
autopilot, the multiple sensors involved, and did some PR damage control by touting
Mobileye as the best at what they do. This was all pretty much expected stuff considering
the headline grabbing nature of what transpired the day before. What did however
surprise us was Tesla's decision to criticize Hotz's project for its obvious limitations.


Specifically, they wrote this:


We think it is extremely unlikely that a single person or even a small company that lacks
extensive engineering validation capability will be able to produce an autonomous driving
system that can be deployed to production vehicles. It may work as a limited demo on a
known stretch of road -- Tesla had such a system two years ago -- but then requires
enormous resources to debug over millions of miles of widely differing roads.


This is the true problem of autonomy: getting a machine learning system to be 99%
correct is relatively easy, but getting it to be 99.9999% correct, which is where it ultimately
needs to be, is vastly more difficult. One can see this with the annual machine vision

competitions, where the computer will properly identify something as a dog more than
99% of the time, but might occasionally call it a potted plant. Making such mistakes at 70
mph would be highly problematic.


So, Hotz is essentially taking an approach that involves building and testing a system with
simplified code predicated on outright direct perception learning from actual human
driving, and Tesla is criticizing him for the potential risks involved in doing such a thing
without extensive validation capabilities. Yet, here is Tesla, with its 'extensive engineering
validation capabilities', sticking its definitely not 99.9999% reliable yet Autopilot system in
the hands of 40,000 eager consumers. What's more concerning Hotz's machine
learning system confusing a dog for a potted plant with him behind the wheel
building out his capabilities and collecting data, or 1/40,000 amped up Model S
driver engaging Tesla Autopilot and failing to react when the car misses a lane
marking and decides to accelerate towards oncoming traffic?


We wonder what Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) thinks about all of this as
they have taken the painstakingly slow and safe approach here versus Tesla who brought
(albeit quite impressively so far) Autopilot to market in less than two years.


Here is what they had to say about the flaws of semi-autonomy in their most recent
monthly self-driving car project update:


People didn't pay attention like they should have. We saw some silly behavior, including
someone who turned around and searched the back seat for his laptop to charge his
phone -- while travelling 65mph down the freeway! We saw human nature at work: people
trust technology very quickly once they see it works. As a result, it's difficult for them to dip
in and out of the task of driving when they are encouraged to switch off and relax. We did
spend some time thinking about ways we could build features to address what is often
referred to as "The Handoff Problem" -- keeping drivers engaged enough that they can
take control of driving as needed. The industry knows this is a big challenge, and they're
spending lots of time and effort trying to solve this. One study by the Virginia Tech
Transportation Institute found that drivers required somewhere between five and eight
seconds to safely regain control of a semi-autonomous system. In an NHTSA study
published in August 2015, some participants took up to 17 seconds to respond to alerts
and take control of the vehicle -- in that time they'd have covered more than a quarter of a
mile at highway speeds. There's also the challenge of context -- once you take back
control, do you have enough understanding of what's going on around the vehicle to make
the right decision? In the end, our tests led us to our decision to develop vehicles that
could drive themselves from point A to B, with no human intervention. (We were also

persuaded by the opportunity to help everyone get around, not just people who can drive.)
Everyone thinks getting a car to drive itself is hard. It is. But we suspect it's probably just
as hard to get people to pay attention when they're bored or tired and the technology is
saying "don't worry, I've got this...for now."


Kind of hard to disagree with their concerns, and it seems they are not alone. BMW's CEO
took a shot at Tesla's autopilot, dubbing it an 'app industry' approach that doesn't comport
with the automotive space where you need to launch a car that is 100% reliable versus
simply putting out something that can be done but definitely not completely ready to be put
in the hands of consumers yet. Ford (NYSE:F) has also decided to skip Level 3 Semi-
Autonomy and move right to Level 4, and word is other automakers are starting to
consider the same thing. The growing consensus is, generally speaking, focusing on an
HMI to address the human problem in level 3 semi-autonomy is simply not worth the risk,
and that resources are better spent focusing on Level 4 or in Google's and some other
cases complete Level 5 autonomy.


So why bring this up here?


We personally love what Tesla is doing, and for that matter what Hotz is trying to do. Can
you imagine Uber (UBER) retrofitting an entire fleet of their cars with his technology?
What do you think that would do for advancing AI trained driving vision systems? The
problem is we are now much more confident that this experimenting is either going to end
or be brought under a very tight regulatory leash. Tesla is already dialing back on the
Autopilot by bringing restrictions to its new upgrade which we have no doubt are going to
anger a lot of vocal Model S owners who paid $3,000 for what right now can best be
described as a unique gadget whose owners love showing off and tinkering with it, and
are always one unfortunate catastrophic accident away from a media and industry
firestorm. We also imagine it is a matter of time before the inevitable regulatory backlash
regarding Hotz's hacking gains steam. How long before some politician starts making a
name with the, 'we can't just have 20-somethings building self-driving cars in their garage
and then putting them on public highways can we' message? A couple months max? No
matter how you cut it, we are quite confident that the self-driving space is
approaching a critical turning point. There is going to be a lot more structure, and
we are confident the big loser in all of this will be those with near term semi-
autonomous ambitions. We also think this changes the game for the technologies
involved on the road to full autonomy, and who the winners might end up being
there. With less focus on incremental near term semi-autonomous features, we
expect a lot more focus to shift towards LIDAR, high precision GPS, and V2V

communication. In particular, we expect LIDAR to be a big beneficiary. Prices have
already come down drastically with Veldoyne expected to ship sub $500 systems in the
first quarter of 2016 and Quanergy launching a $250 solid state system next month. As
more automobile companies focus on Level 4 and Level 5 roadmaps, we expect LIDAR
and high precision GPS adoption to accelerate. This isn't just speculation on our part; at a
recent industry conference, Delphi's CTO stated, "We found as we looked at the data that
LIDAR is going to be instrumental, we think, to fully automated future vehicles." Then you
have Mercedes which had seemingly been confident that they can do without LIDAR
changing their tune by making investments in the space. The much talked about Nissan
Piloted Drive relies on a specially developed high spec miniature laser scanner to allow
the car to weave through tight spaces.


How Does This All Impact Mobileye?


Well, on one end there is a degree of good news here as automakers will probably focus
more on their near term ADAS plans where Mobileye is a dominant and well positioned
player. The bad news is that Mobileye's almost religious argument for a mono vision
dominated autonomous future is clearly dead on arrival. The related sensor tech is just
going to be way too cheap and way too reliable by the time these cars start hitting the
road, and thus Mobileye will be a smaller piece of the pie. Not the biggest deal until you
look at sell-side models like the recent Evercore report which has Mobileye ASPs rising to
over $100 in 2040.


Why Is the Sell-Side So Stubborn On This Name?


Honestly, reading sell-side research on Mobileye makes us cringe. It's as if their goal in life
is to drive unwitting investors to lose money on this stock. Below is the change in Mobileye
short interest since we published our report in mid-August.

You'd think this would get some of these geniuses on the sell-side to back off a bit, but that
has not been the case.


For example, how can you not cringe when you read comments like this:


"Even though machine perception is likely to be commoditized over next few years, each
successive moat may be even wider."-Evercore, MBLY DEC 7


So, they have a 4-7 year lead in deep learning, and a potential inestimable lead in artificial
super human intelligence down the road. Mobileye hadn't even mentioned the phrase
deep learning until Drive PX popped onto the scene, and all of a sudden they are
untouchable here? Do you think this analyst spoke to anyone outside of Mobileye's CTO
in the AI Driving Vision space because we can tell him there are some people in the field
who would die laughing after reading such a statement. Who are we to judge these
engineers, as we are not AI experts. All we can say is that Hotz thinks their technology is
a 'joke' and he's made AI his life obsession for the past few years. Maybe just maybe
there is a middle of the road that doesn't essentially require stating:


Mobileye's main source of revenue for the next three to four years will be
commoditized, but they will dominate cutting edge future technology I have little
understanding of for the coming twenty years!!

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3768736-mobileye-tesla-geohot-controversy-just-tip-iceberg 9/22


We do often wonder what it is about growth darlings that makes analysts never ever want
to back down. Consider the fact that several analysts are willing to concede Mobileye will
see serious commoditization pressure in ADAS, and some are even of the view that ADAS
adoption rates could disappoint. Yet, they all seem to have these elaborate projections for
autonomous/semi-autonomous future domination as well as strong views on said
technology today. You think any of these guys realize that in the time since we published
on Mobileye our Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) long actually outperformed our Mobileye short.
Literally, Nvidia shares are up over 50% versus a 35% decline in Mobileye. There is
essentially no material news out of Nvidia and yet the world's leading GPU maker rerated
up 50% in the span of months. Yet, here they are all still pounding away on MBLY stock,
and having to defend it from threats from 26-year-old whiz kid garage hackers. This to us
is remarkable, and here is why.


Consider for a second that we are completely wrong with respect to our views on semi-
autonomous driving, and Mobileye's future role as a dominant sensor in autonomous
driving. We are willing to accept that and despite our rapidly rising conviction here
acknowledge a probability of being proven wrong on this topic. Certainty here is extremely
difficult to achieve even if you start to see evidence of a strong thesis materializing, yet
this doesn't seem to give most sell-siders pause. Meanwhile they seem much less
interested in current developments in the space that have a greater bearing on Mobileye's
prospects or for that matter doing a better job of explaining what it is the company actually
does.


One thing that still bothers us a lot is this general view of Mobileye as some sort ADAS OS
that the Tier 1's simply buy and presto achieve functionality once they plug it into a
camera. Tesla has gone to great lengths to shed the off-the-shelf product view with

https://seekingalpha.com/article/3768736-mobileye-tesla-geohot-controversy-just-tip-iceberg 10/22


respect to their ADAS, but that doesn't mean the others don't also feel the same way.
Mobileye provides vision algorithms on a chip, they do not do the complex control system
integration. Yet, we can't recall a single report that has gone to great lengths to explain
what this means. There is a reason the Tier 1's working with Mobileye still hire teams of
vision algorithm engineers and product feature development engineers, and often work
with related contract manufacturers to develop their complex ADAS systems. Also all
these players have invested heavily in sensor fusion capabilities to develop the related
ECUs, and in many cases in related automobile vision technology capabilities that they
are doing in-house despite using Mobileye.


To put the recent hoopla around GeoHot's hack in perspective, just consider the below
project description from an employee at Mobileye's largest Tier 1 customer TRW for a
rear-camera AEB system for a model 2018 year launch.


Technical Specialist, Camera & Radar


TRW


June 2014 - January 2015 (8 months)


I was the lead embedded algorithm engineer developing an intelligent rear-view
camera to detect and classify objects behind a passenger car. This safety sensor
activates automatic braking to prevent the vehicle from impacting objects during
backup maneuvers. I designed the machine vision algorithms and wrote embedded
C code capable of real-time execution (30 frames per second) on a TI-TDA2x
processor. I was the technical manager for a team of 4 contract engineers working in
India. These engineers worked under my guidance developing other crucial
components of this safety sensor. Intended for MY 2018, domestic passenger car
production.


Mobileye is supposedly planning on getting into rear AEB and surround view, yet here we
have a team of four at Mobileye's largest customer developing the machine vision
algorithms in-house on a TDA2X processor. Hmm, not exactly the type of stuff that quarter
century monopolies are made of.


What are we supposed to read into TRW's parent ZF Friedrichshafen's acquisition of the
vision algorithm engineering software group of HDLE GmbH? These guys are supposedly
developing the in-house surround view capabilities at ZF, where does that fit in with
Mobileye down the road?

And how about this recent pamphlet from ZF on Automated Driving which highlights
stereo technology as well as mono?


Or how about this recent job posting for an Image Processing Algorithm Engineer from
another Mobileye Tier 1 partner Magna.


Magna Electronics, an operating unit of Magna International, provides innovative
electronic systems through manufacturing facilities and engineering divisions located all
over the world. They design and supply the unique electronic components and sub-
systems to meet future vehicle system needs.


Major Responsibilities  
• Development (design, implement, validate and debug) of state of the art camera based

from concept phase to production  
• Definition, integration, testing, delivery and maintenance of automotive vehicle control

• Select and design the image processing and enhancement algorithm for the specific

Are we supposed to conclude they are building their own camera? Can we conclude they
have no aspirations at any point down the road to do so?


Our research presently indicates that is not the case, but then again we also don't expect
current partners to advertise their future competitive road map plans to their existing
suppliers. What we do know with confidence is that the Tier 1's are developing significant
in-house vision algorithm development resources by the simple virtue of working with
Mobileye. At the worst, this gives us conviction in the view that when combined with
related competition this will continually exert downwards pressure on ASPs as ADAS

adoption ramps. We've gone into this detail to prove a point about Wall Street analysts
reading too much into things that don't matter and simultaneously speculating about future
technology that clearly none of them understand.


What we can tell you is there has been a whole bunch of stuff going on in the space
worthy of keeping an eye on that gets virtually no sell-side coverage.

Some Thoughts On The Stock Side Of Things


This article really is meant to be about shorting Mobileye stock. We think we did a good
enough job laying that out the first time around, and that's why we have kept silent on the
matter since we first published. But to be clear ,our views on this short haven't changed
much since our initial report, and we don't plan on getting into valuation here again. It is
obviously less compelling at $40 than it was at $63, but that is not exactly saying much.
The stock could fall another 50% from here, and this debate could simply be recycled for
whether it's going to be heading to $10 or $30 from there.


The news flow has kind of gone as we expected with the surprises so far being heavily
weighted to the negative side. The Hotz/Musk incident definitely took us by surprise as
you rarely expect to see such embarrassing headlines enter the public domain on a
company like this. Add in our views on semi-autonomous going forward, our expectations
for Mobileye ADAS volumes in 2016, and generally the worst tape we have seen for
hyped growth tech stocks in five years and we guess you could say we are modestly more
negative on the name now. The macro environment for these names has definitely crept
up on us, as for the first time in a while there seem to be no fads in publicly listed high
