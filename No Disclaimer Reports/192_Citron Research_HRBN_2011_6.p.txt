HARBIN ELECTRIC: THE
BLACK HOLE OF
INFORMATION


Whether a company’s stock trades in the US, Shanghai,


Hong Kong or Shenzen, all investors want the same thing: 


transparency.  The problem with Harbin
(NASDAQ:HRBN) is not the short-sellers, as the company


so vehemently stated on its last conference call.  The


problem is the company has been violating every principle


of transparency over recent years, which only intensifies as


the company ramps up its claims of an upcoming $24 a


share private takeover.


Investors have nothing to judge an actual business, absent


a buyout offer, except a 2010 audit by defunct auditor


Frazer Frost, which was has become the poster child for


auditor negligence in the Chinese RTO space.  Meanwhile,


Harbin Electric’s stock is being propped on the promise of a


going-private transaction at $24 per share, a make-good


for any possible operational problem the company has or


any inconsistency in its financial reporting.  The story has


not wavered in the face of:


industrial slowdowns both worldwide and in China


increasing gross margin pressure on the entire Chinese


industrial sector — in both labor and materials


wave after wave of exposures of fraud among China


RTO’s

the specific corruption being investigated among


China’s rail industry after the recent fatal crash


bank / state credit tightening in China


… just to name a few headwinds.


The operations of the company, as well as the going-private


promises, are perched to an extraordinary degree, on the


representations and obfuscations of just one man,


Chairman Tianfu Yang.


The going private transaction filings are already replete


with Chairman Yang’s refusal to provide transparency into


his company.  Thwarting Morgan Stanley's buyer search,


Chairman Yang’s was unwilling to share sufficient


information with any parties trying to value the company. 


Its language we've never seen before in a public company


document.  (See link below to "no disclosure to suitors". )  


Further, despite having hired the world’s pre-eminent


investment bank, Goldman Sachs to advise him personally,


the bank financing essential to the company’s going-private


transaction has been negotiated by just one man, Tianfu


Yang.  Outside confirmation of the “bankability” of this loan


commitment has been reduced to just one single disclosed


conference call among the parties.  All of the nameplate


advisors have explicitly disclaimed any
independent verification of material company
information, or the responsibility to acquire
any, beyond what the company has disclosed
to them.


And still the financials for this company are no better than


those provided by the disgraced audit firm Frazer Frost,


which is actually not in business any longer, its own


merger-formed company torn apart by SEC sanctions for


shoddy work practices (


http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/33-9166.pdf


[https://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/2010/33-9166.pdf]


) and failure to detect fraud at RINO.


   Where is Harbin’s Real Business?

Here is a glaringly simple question, yet one which


shareholders are willing to overlook in the hopes of a


buyout.  Who are Harbin’s customers?  The linear and


micro motor division creates custom motor solutions. 


Therefore the company should have a portfolio  of


customers with large-scale production orders.   Harbin’s


revenue growth claims are enormous – it claims it is now


doing more business in its most recent quarter than it did


in the entire year 2008 — a 400% increase in just over 2


years — and at very high margins.   But not a single


customer of significant size can be independently


confirmed.  With a $500 million a year run rate, it should


be possible to find at least a few customers doing $25, or


$15 or even $10 million a year in verifiable revenues with


Harbin.  But there simply are not.


This is why Citron’s findings published two weeks ago here 


http://citronresearch.com/index.php/2011/08/03/harbin-


electric-completely-exposed/


[http://citronresearch.com/index.php/2011/08/03/harbin-


electric-completely-exposed/]   are so disturbing.  Harbin


stopped disclosing customer concentration identities and


percentages in 2010.  But its claimed 2009 and 2008 large


customers do not check out, and are easily disproven. 


Harbin’s largest purported customer in 2008 (and #2 in


2009), Jiangsu Liyang Car Seat Adjuster, simply does not


manufacture or offer for sale electric seat adjusters (after a


brief attempt to expand into that product line), and states


it buys no electric motors. 


So who are the customers?  To make matters worse, the


company was not willing to disclose or discuss customers


even with a possible suitor, who was brought to the table


by Morgan Stanley, as evidenced by comments in the


fairness opinion.

suitors.pdf]


Instead of issuing Press Releases attacking short sellers, if


Chairman Yang were interested in building the value of his


company, rather than manipulating the price of his


company’s stock, he simply needs to make his company


transparent to investors.  With millions spent on “advisors”,

http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-the-black-hole-of-information/ 4/10


not one dime has been spent to remedy the lack of a


reliable audit.  Why has Harbin published at least 5 PR’s in


the last year attacking shortsellers, and 7 others about the


going-private transaction, yet only one identifying a single


design win leading to a new piece of business with a


disclosed party.  Citron has made a simple chart that shows


the communications from Harbin to Wall Street.  In the


past 2 years, Harbin has only disclosed one customer order


(and we do not even know the value of the order) in


December in 2010.  Besides that….nothing.


HRBN PR survey [http://citronresearch.com/wp-
content/uploads/2011/08/HRBN-PR-survey.pdf]


 


   How do you explain this land
transaction?


It has been a common tactic of China fraud stocks to


announce fraudulent asset purchases to offset claims of


fraudulent revenue.  The problem is, if you announce huge


fictitious gross and net revenues, how do you account for


the fact that your cash never goes up?  You have to offset


the fake profits with fake asset purchases.  PUDA, YONG


and BORN are just a few of the firms that have gone this


route.


So it raised a few eyebrows when Harbin abruptly


announced with its most recent “record” quarter, that it


was putting down a $23 million deposit on land rights for a


new factory.   This transaction was never disclosed in a


press release, nor was the need for these 80 acres was


ever previosuly disclosed in a conference call or investor


presentation.  It just suddenly appeared in a filing last


quarter’s 10-Q.  (It is just a coincidence that the purchase


price is almost exactly Harbin’s pretax net income reported


for the quarter?)


 


"On June 10, 2011, Simo Motor entered into a land use


agreement (the “Simo Land Use Agreement”) with Xi’an


Lintong Tourism and Business Development Management


Commission (“Xi’an Lintong”) with respect to Simo Motor’s use


of 500 Chinese Mu of land (approximately 82.4 acres or 333,500

square meters) located at Daixin Industrial Development Zone in


Xi’an Lintong (the “New Site”). Pursuant to the Simo Land Use


Agreement, the New Site will be used for construction of a new


manufacturing facility that will produce electric equipment and


machinery and related products as part of a capacity expansion


project at Xi’an Simo. The term of the Simo Land Use


Agreement is 50 years and the aggregate amount that Simo


Motor shall pay to Xi’an Lintong is approximately $38.8 million


(RMB 250 million). The Company made a pre-payment of $23.0


million (RMB 150 million) as of June 30, 2011 and will pay in


full upon receipt of the land use license to be issued by the


government."


 


The price Harbin paid for the most recent land transaction


comes out to be 500 thousand RMB per Mu.  This price


appears seriously inflated after some online research and


review of corresponding land bureau records.

The link above shows the purchase of 242.85 Mu of


industrial use land in the exact same industrial park,


dated 2008.  The purchase price then was a mere 70


thousand RMB per Mu, 14% of what Harbin is paying. While


Chinese land price appreciation has been steep since 2008,


a 700% appreciation is not credible.

The link above is a policy document that shows the


purchase price of the industrial park. While the date of the


info is unclear, the purchase price comes to between 30


thousand to 60 thousand per Mu, roughly in line with the


2008 purchase record.

The link above contains information about industrial land


purchase prices during 2009 and 2010, in the city of


Lintong, where Harbin’s land purchase is located.  We see


prices of 112 thousand per Mu, less than 1/4th the 500


thousand per Mu Harbin paid for its land.

The link above shows transactions and comparable land


purchase data pulled from Xi’an land bureau. Harbin’s land


purchase price simply doesn’t make sense when


benchmarked against the recent transaction data and it


most likely grossly overstated the price it paid for the land


acquisition.  Further, this price would amount to more


than double the entire land use rights the entire


company shows on its balance sheet! 


Yet, not only did the company not state its intention to


commit to this size land rights purchase, it didn't even put


out a PR when it closed the deal.  Can this transaction


stand independent scrutiny?  


   Xi’an 


Citron thought the following article, on the wild-west state


of stock peddling in China, with epicenter in Xi’an, which


happens to be where Harbin Ximo Motor is domiciled and


where the “funky” land transaction occurred.  What makes


this article interesting is it shows that even local Chinese


are not immune to RTO scams and the epicenter of the


problems is in the backyard of Harbin.

http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-the-black-hole-of-information/ 7/10


In Harbin’s most recent filings, we read an interesting


disclosure, which management was recently asked to


explain.  


“In February 2011, the Company entered into a


consulting service agreement with a third party which


agreed to provide advisory and consulting services to


obtain financing in Chinese Capital Market for a period


of 5 years from 2011 to 2015. The service fee is non-


refundable and amounted to $3 million.”  


Of the $3 million, over 2.9 million has already been paid to


this undisclosed party … in cash.  Now while Citron does


not believe that $3 million is enough to secure a $450


million loan that cannot get paid back, we do believe that it


is more than enough to secure loan documents.  Why we


believe this to be true is twofold.


1. If there is one thing Harbin can do without
consultants is raise money.  The company has


multiple bank loans, relationships with the largest


investment bankers in the world, and a purported


deep-rooted relationship with one of the largest banks


in China. 


2. In normal fundraising situations, companies pay
investment bankers a percentage after the money


has been raised.  The upfront money to this


undisclosed entity that was given the same month


that all parties walked away from a possible takeover


transaction is the type of business done by companies


on the brink of bankruptcy, not ones about to be


taken over.


3. Most importantly, what makes this relevant now is
that management had an opportunity to respond to


the question of to whom and why they gave this


money.  But management chose doubletalk and


subterfuge, offering us this response:

   The Black Swan


 


Citron, like many other investors, has taken a position that


the lack of transparency about this company, and its


operating history, create a significant risk that this deal is


just a charade and can never close on the terms disclosed. 


Investors will have to take their chances on a binary event


– either the going private deal is funded and closes, or it


does not, and the stock falls to low single digits.  There is


really no other outcome.


This has nothing whatsoever to do with the fiction of


"forcing down the company's stock price" the fiction


management keeps trumpeting.   Based on mountains of


due diligence, only the summary of which can be effectively


reported in a blog, it is Citron’s belief that Harbin Electric


cannot possibly pass an audit with a real accounting
�rm, or justify an enterprise value of $750+ million. 
Further, without the going-private deal, its stock is worth


no more than $2 or $3 on the Nasdaq market.   Meanwhile,


Harbin has never responded to any of the substantive


disclosure failures raised by Citron with verifiable  answers


about the business, rather just more defense of the


buyout.  Their story, and their stock, is propped by hope –


the light at the end of the tunnel — without ever disclosing


the dangers lurking for investors if that light is not reached.


However, what Citron cannot control is whether the political


and economic situation in China is so corrupt that a bank


can be influenced to make a low interest $400 million dollar


loan that makes no business or economic sense, and that


has no chance of ever being repaid.   If Tianfu Yang is able


to use his influence and power to effect lending of a state


owned bank on a stack of material misrepresentations,


then the shorts are dealt a black swan situation. That is a


question that no independent research or investment


banking firm can handicap.


If this is the case, however, the current price of Harbin’s


stock should be of no consequence whatsoever to Chairman


Yang.  In fact, the lower it trades, the more “easy money”


can be earned by his minions by simply waiting for this


"sure thing" deal to close.  His preoccupation with the short


positions and the option positions is all just noise.  The
5/18/2018 Harbin Electric: The Black Hole of Information – Citron Research


http://citronresearch.com/harbin-electric-the-black-hole-of-information/ 9/10


shareholder vote is a foregone conclusion; every


shareholder wants the “easy profit” of the $24 payout.  The


only question is whether this deal is real or not, period. 


   Conclusion


Citron expects that there will be private buyouts of a few


Chinese companies in the next year.  But these will be at


very modest prices, after the fraudulent inflated claims


wash out.  The transparency risks of companies operating


in China have been made very very clear to the market,


and are now increasingly being priced in.


Meanwhile, Citron has published ample evidence that


Harbin Electric closely resembles the raft of other China


RTO’s that have collapsed under the weight of their


material misstatements to the US market.  Consider:


Extreme revenue growth, but an absence of verifiable


customers


50-year old main manufacturing facility


Its unlikely cash position inconsistent with its


patchwork of loans and financings


Quarter after quarter of purported “record profits”, but


keeps needing financing


Hasty and apparently fabricated land rights transaction


Unnecessary cash-up-front “Fees” to undisclosed


parties


No legal or financial accountability from the many paid


advisors and consultants to the deal


If this buyout deal should hit a “last minute snag”, in Q1,


2012, China Development Bank’s financing commitment is


set to expire, just days before the company faces its March


15, 2012 audited 10-K filing date with no “plan B”.  Without


audited financials, Harbin then faces delisting proceedings. 


It is Citron’s belief that the company cannot pass a real


audit, and the only way an unaffiliated banking entity


would finance a $400 million dollar loan for this company is


with the application of substantial “guanxi”, which is not a


balance sheet item.

Meanwhile, the regulatory risk remains very high.  Harbin


trades despite its obviously deficient 2010 audit, and its


failure to satisfy Nasdaq independent audit committee


requirements, which it was notified about in 2009.  It is


obvious from prior Citron reports that Audit Committee


Chair Boyd Plowman is not and was never "independent",


due to his undisclosed director's role at various Abax


entities. 


Meanwhile, if unchallenged by regulators, the proliferation


of other “Chairman led” buyouts flying in the face of due


diligence, (latest example PUDA) is an obvious


consequence for the US markets.


 


PS   If the deal doesn’t close, don’t expect the deal terms


to provide consequences that protect shareholders.  No


purchase money is escrowed in this deal structure.  90% of


the termination fee would be due from Chairman Yang


himself.  And as Chairman, it would be his responsibility to


collect it …. from himself.  Now that’s a payment that


would take some “guanxi”…!
