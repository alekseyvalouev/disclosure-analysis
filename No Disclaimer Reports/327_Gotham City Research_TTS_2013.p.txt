GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH LLC


a GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH’S OPINIONS


 Tile Shop’s 2013 LTM earnings are overstated by over
200%. TTS’s actual 2013 LTM EPS is closer to $0.18/share.


 TTS will restate several years’ historical results as a result
of the issues covered in this report.


 The company has used its China-based undisclosed related
party and improper accounting to overstate profits.


 Gross margins will continue to decline through 2014, as
TTS must reverse prior years’ accounting overstatements.


 Tile Shop’s shares are worth no more than $1.54-
$3.34/share, implying 84%-93% downside.


 TTS’s creditors will likely restrict additional indebtedness &
capital expenditures until TTS’s accounting is corrected.


SUMMARY OF THE BASES OF OPINIONS


 TTS’s largest supplier, Beijing Pingxiu, is an undisclosed
related company, and accounts for 20-30+% of TTS’s COGs.


 Beijing Pingxiu is secretly controlled by Fumitake Nishi. Mr.
Nishi is the CEO’s brother-in-law and a TTS employee.


 Beijing Pingxiu invoices sent to the Tile Shop are directed
to Fumitake Nishi. Beijing Pingxiu has no presence in one
of its listed addresses, and a minimal presence in another.


 Days sales’ inventory for FY2011 & LTM 2013 exceed 365
days, at 396 & 414 days respectively.


 TTS inventory growth exceeds sales growth by 3x, as of
9/30/2013. Inventory growth has, on average, exceeded
sales growth by 2.1x over the last 5 years.


 The CEO believes TTS is worth somewhere between $83.6
and $180.4 million ($1.0-$2.2 million per store).


 Free cash flow has gone negative over the last 9 months.
 Tile Shop has had 3 different auditors in the last 2 years.
 TTS has missed EPS guidance 4 out of the last 5 quarters.
 Color Tile, Inc., the only other national specialty tile


retailer in US history, filed for Ch. 11 bankruptcy in 1996.
CEO Bob Rucker worked for Color Tile.

INTRODUCTION


GOTHAM CITY RESEARCH first heard about Tile Shop Holdings last summer, when the company entered
the US public equity markets via a SPAC (special-purpose acquisition company). Many low quality
companies and outright frauds have historically entered the public markets via SPACs and reverse
mergers. We decided to monitor TTS closely, as we suspected that it too is a low quality company. Our
interest in the Tile Shop story increased recently, after we found a few smoking guns.


We found that Beijing Pingxiu, Tile Shop’s largest China-based supplier (accounts for over 30% of TTS’s
COGs), is an undisclosed related party, and that invoices sent to Tile Shop from Beijing Pingxiu, originate
from phantom addresses.


We also found that Fumitake Nishi, who is the CEO’s brother-in-law and a TTS employee, seems to send
invoices from China, directed to none other than himself (sent to Tile Shop addresses).


These set of facts would explain why Tile Shop’s gross margins seem too good to be true and why recent
DSI numbers seem unrealistically high. We decided it was important to go public with our findings after
we uncovered these smoking guns, and got a sense for how the many seemingly disparate red flags, all
tie-in together. We are confident that Tile Shop is similar to Crazy Eddie’s of the 1980s, and that the
company will meet a similar fate. For example:


 Tile Shop secretly controls Beijing Pingxiu1 (and probably other) suppliers to overstate profits.
Crazy Eddie’s used a quasi-captive distributor, Wren Distributors, to overstate profits2.


 TTS’s inventory growth exceeds sales growth by a factor of 2x-3x. Crazy Eddie’s inventory
growth exceeded sales growth by over 2x, before it went bankrupt3.


 Family members and close friends play important roles within Tile Shop. Family and friends
infamously played an important role in the Crazy Eddie’s fraud.


Tile Shop May Be Worse than Crazy Eddie’s


While Tile Shop and Crazy Eddie’s inventory growth vs. sales growth figures appear equally bad, Tile
Shop’s most recent days’ sales of inventory (“DSI”) looks far worse4:


As Crazy Eddie’s, Symbol Technologies, and other famous inventory accounting frauds remind us: if
margins seem too good to be true (and too smooth to be true), they probably are. We believe that the
chickens are about to come home to roost for Tile Shop and CEO Bob Rucker. We recommend you sell
shares immediately.

TTS Uses an Undisclosed Related Party to Overstate Earnings


Tile Shop Gross Margins are Exceptionally High and Smooth – Are Margins Too Good to Be True?


“When I see a bird that walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, I call that
bird a duck” – James Whitcomb Riley


The Tile Shop is a specialty retailer of tile in the United States. The retail tile market is highly-fragmented,
yet TTS has somehow managed to report exceptionally high and smooth gross margins1:


The now defunct Color Tile Inc., the Tile Shop’s only truly comparable company, achieved gross margins
between 41%-48%2. That is, Color Tile’s margins were nearly half of TTS’s and twice as volatile.


What is Tile Shop’s secret sauce? The company attributes its apparent success to the following factors3:


We are confident that Tile Shop’s gross margins are too good to be true, just as Bernie Madoff and Allen
Stanford’s extremely high and smooth investment returns were proven to be too good to be true.

TTS Uses Beijing Pingxiu and Improper Accounting to Overstate Earnings


We believe Tile Shop’s true key to success has been Beijing Pingxiu, its undisclosed related supplier, and
improper accounting. Specifically, we believe the company is engaged in two parallel schemes:


 TTS uses Beijing Pingxiu (“BP”) and its other captive, phantom suppliers to overstate inventories,
understate cost of sales, and overstate gross profits in its 10Ks, 10Qs, and other filings:


 BP sells goods to TTS at (or near) cost, allowing TTS to achieve an artificial cost advantage:

Consequences of Tile Shop’s Undisclosed Related Party Malfeasance


 The artificially high and steady gross margins will decline significantly going forward.
 TTS will restate several years’ historical results as a result of the issues covered in this report.
 The SEC, DOJ, an independent investigation, and/or Tile Shop itself will validate our beliefs.


The following facts support our beliefs:


TTS’s Largest Supplier, Beijing Pingxiu, is an Undisclosed Related Company


 Beijing Pingxiu is an undisclosed related party supplier that accounts for over 30% of TTS’s COGs.
 Beijing Pingxiu is wholly owned by Fumitake Nishi, who is CEO Bob Rucker’s brother-in-law, and


a Tile Shop employee.
 Beijing Pingxiu invoices sent to Tile Shop are directed to Fumitake Nishi.
 Fumitake Nishi, Bob Rucker, and Lee Shoon Rucker (CEO’s wife) have a history of selling each


other assets and sharing addresses.
 2 of Beijing Pingxiu addresses (listed in SAIC filings) appear to be phantom addresses.


Beijing Pingxiu Accounts for over 30% of TTS’s COGs


According to Tile Shop’s SEC filings, “approximately 58% of our purchased product was sourced from
Asia, 9% from North America, 4% from South America, 29% from Europe, and less than 1% from other
locations. Over 95% of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars.”


Asia accounts for over 50% of Tile Shop’s cost of sales, which means that Beijing Pingxiu is particularly
important to TTS, even amongst its Asia-based suppliers. According to PIERS (“Port Import Export
Reporting Service”) data, Beijing Pingxiu accounts for over 30% of Tile Shop’s supplies as of 2013:


Tile Shop’s SEC filings do not mention Beijing Pingxiu in any of its SEC filings. TTS also never mentions the
words ‘China’ or ‘Chinese’ in any of its SEC filings. Given the materiality of the relationship between
Beijing Pingxiu and Tile Holdings, we find this suspicious (at best).


We believe Tile Shop deliberately omits Beijing Pingxiu from its SEC filings because BP is owned by the
CEO’s brother-in-law, and because BP plays a key role in TTS’s malfeasance.


Beijing Pingxiu may simply exist as nothing more than a phantom company, such that Tile Shop uses BP
to achieve whatever margin it so wishes. This would explain why BP operates out of month-to-month,
obscure locations in China, as indicated by our visit to its listed locations.

Beijing Pingxiu and its Ghost Addresses


We visited the Zhang Zhou Hotel, and Beijing Pingxiu has no presence at the hotel:


 Visited the hotel at Room 3408, Zhang Zhou Hotel, G area, 46 Enjizhuang.
 The desk clerk said the hotel currently has a Yunnan restaurant on the first floor, a Karaoke (KTV)


bar on the second floor, and a hotel on the third.
 All offices were moved out of the building in 2011 and she has worked at the hotel for four


years but was not familiar with Beijing Pingxiu.


Recent import and shipping records provided by PIERS clearly lists Zhang Zhou Hotel as BP’s address:


We also visited the Long He location. It is a very small office with minimal activity. One would think
Beijing Pingxiu, TTS largest supplier, would have a little more of a presence at a key location:


 Visited the hotel at Room 202, Long He office building, 78 lor
 Desk clerk recognized Beijing Pingxiu & directed the contact to the Long He office building 2


doors down. When referring to the company, she used the term "zhuang xiu" (to decorate).
 In the lobby of the Long He office building was a sign listing the various companies, including


Beijing Pingxiu in room 202. The 2nd floor, which consisted of a series of doors with no
nameplates, is like the floor of a hotel. Room 202 is a very small premise with no nameplate.


 Other offices on the floor with open doors contained no more than a desk, a few chairs and a
shelf. So the businesses operating in this hotel are clearly quite small. There wasn’t much
activity relating to room 202 and not much movement in the other offices.

Tile Shop Secretly Controls Beijing Pingxhou Through Fumitake Nishi, the CEO’s Brother-in-Law


So far, we know that:


 Beijing Pingxiu is Tile Shop’s largest supplier.
 BP’s physical presence at some of the provided locations is doubtful.
 BP operates at nearly no profit.


In the next few pages, we show how Beijing Pingxiu is, in substance, Tile Shop (i.e. secretly controlled by
Fumitake Nishi, a Tile Shop employee and the CEO’s brother-in-law). We also show invoices that are sent
from Fumitake Nishi of Beijing Pingxiu to Fumitake Nishi of the Tile Shop.


Fumitake Nishi Owns 100% of Beijing Pingxiu, According to Chinese SAIC Filings


As of Nov 8, 2011,西文武 owns 100% of Beijing Pingxiu5:
Page 13 of 58


The page shown below, directly from the Beijing Pingxiu SAIC filing, states that 西文武 holds Japanese
citizenship, and provides a Japanese Passport number6:


西文武 when translated is Fumitake Nishi in Kanji (Fumitake is the given name, Nishi is the surname)


A Japanese translator stated the following:


The Kanji (the Chinese characters) for Nishi's name is 西文武, which is pronounced as ''Xi
Wenwu'' in Chinese pinyin (Chinese characters and Kanji are oftentimes the same or extremely
similar in terms of stroke composition and meaning). However, ''Xi Wenwu'' is not a PRC national,
nor is ''Xi Wenwu'' the Japanese pronunciation of his name. The proper romanization of his name
is NISHI Humitake (note: Humitake is also sometimes romanized as ''Fumitake'').


We consulted two other Chinese/Japanese translators and they independently verified that 西文武 is
Fumitake Nishi. The translators also noted the following:


 西文武 is not a Chinese name, nor does it make sense as a Chinese name.
 Fumitake Nishi is not a common Japanese name. If I hear this name, I would wonder if this


person would be originally from China but living in Japan or something.

Fumitake Nishi Owns Beijing Pingxiu and Invoices Are Sent to Him and the Tile Shop


Patent records and shipping records indicate that Fumitake Nishi is a Tile Shop employee. Shipping
records sent from Beijing Pingxiu to Tile Shop state “attn: Fumitake Nishi” (please see the appendix for
full sized versions of the documents shown below)7:
Page 15 of 58


Fumitake Nishi is CEO Robert Rucker’s Brother-in-Law


We believe Fumitake Nishi is CEO Robert Rucker’s Brother-in-Law (through his wife, Lee Shoon
Hammond, who also goes by Xun Li) for the following reasons (please see the appendix for more
information):


 Ex-employees say Fumitake Nishi and CEO Bob Rucker are related. They also say that Fumitake
Nishi goes by ‘Ben Lee’ in the US.8


 Fumitake Nishi’s daughter XXXXX Nishi lists YYYYY Hammond as her cousin:


 Lee Shoon Hammond is CEO Rucker’s wife. YYYYY Hammond is her son:


 Bob Rucker and his wife Lee Shoon Hammond sold a home located on 6489 W 168th Avenue in
Eden Prairie, MN to Fumitake Nishi9.


 Fumitake Nishi and Lee Shoon Hammond’s businesses (e.g. China Link Consultants), share a
common business address, 5245 Silver Maple Circle:

TTS 2013 LTM Earnings Overstated by Over 200%


Sam Antar, former CFO of Crazy Eddie’s (“CRZY”), describes how CRZY’s cozy relationship with one of its
distributors/suppliers helped it commit accounting fraud1:


“Crazy Eddie’s had a very cozy relationship with a vendor known as Wren Distributors (Wren).
We were Wren's largest customer, accounting for 35% of its revenues. We purchased over 10%
of our merchandise from Wren. In order to inflate our inventory without adding to our accounts
payable, I asked Wren to ship us $3 -$4 million in merchandise before 1986 year-end, but to
hold off billing until after the auditors completed the year-end audit. Because the merchandise
was included in the year-end inventory count without recording the corresponding accounts
payable to Wren, we were able to inflate income by $3-$4 million.


In 1987, we continued to take advantage of our relationship with Wren. I pressured Wren to ship
us about $5-$7 million in merchandise before year-end. The merchandise was included in the
year-end inventory count without being included in the amount owed to the vendor.”


Just like Crazy Eddie’s, we believe Tile Shop is using its captive suppliers in order to overstate earnings.
We think TTS may prove to be worse than CRZY, as it secretly controls at least one of its largest suppliers.


Evidence that Reported Gross Profits are Overstated


 Day sales’ inventory for FY2011 & LTM 2013 exceed 365 days, at 396 & 414 days respectively.
Inventory is a current asset, which means it should be converted to cash within 365 days.


 Inventories growth exceeds sales growth by over 3x for 2013 TTM, September 30th, 2013.
Inventories growth has exceeded sales growth by over 2x, on average, over the last 6 years.


 Color Tile Inc, (TTS’s only true historical comparable company), DSI stood between 80-90 days.
 Lumber Liquidators’ inventory growth has tracked sales growth over the same period. Some on


Wall Street believe that Tile Shop is like LL. Inventory and sales growth figures show otherwise.
 Gross margins are unusually high and smooth, just as Bernie Madoff and Allen Stanford’s


purported investment returns were unusually high and smooth.


Tile Shop’s Explanations are Dubious or Demonstrably False


Some investors and others have questioned TTS gross margins and inventory levels. TTS management’s
explanations (regarding their gross margins, and inventories) are dubious, if not demonstrably false:


 Management recently claimed inventory levels are high because they need to build out
inventory in advance because “A lot of production and shipping shuts down in China in January”.
Shipping records say otherwise.


 Management claimed inventory rose in Q3 2013 due to its new Durant related distribution
center . TTS used the same explanation to explain why inventory rose in Q2 2013.

TTS Bears an Eerie Resemblance to the Crazy Eddie’s Accounting Fraud


Gotham City Research has seen many variations of the inventory accounting fraud story, and we know
how it always ends. TTS exhibits all the classic symptoms of a company that is overstating reported gross
profits, by improperly overstating inventories, just as Crazy Eddie’s did before it filed for bankruptcy.


Crazy Eddie’s used a captive distributor to inflate profits, as described in the prior page. Tile Shop
secretly controls its largest supplier (as we detailed in the prior section), and we believe it uses this
dubious entity to report fictitious margins. The similarities don’t end there.


For starters, Tile Shop’s inventory growth exceeds sales growth by 2x-3x2:


Crazy Eddie’s inventory growth exceeded sales growth by over 2x as well, just before it went bankrupt3:


Lumber Liquidators’ and Color Tile’s Inventory Growth Does Not Meaningfully Exceed Sales Growth


Many on Wall Street claim that Tile Shop is the next Lumber Liquidators, yet Lumber Liquidators’
inventory growth looks quite healthy relative to sales growth, unlike Tile Shop4:

Page 18 of 58


And if we compare Tile Shop against its only true comparable company, Color Tile, Inc. (which went
bankrupt in the 1990s), we find that its inventory growth vs. sales growth trends seem plausible5:


Color Tile Inc Sales declined in 1994 and inventories rose. This would makes sense, as a decline in sales
would lead to a buildup in inventory. In 1995, sales grew at a blistering 21% rate, yet inventories only
grew by 4.6%. This too makes sense, since the prior year’s excess inventory buildup diminishes the need
for aggressive inventory purchases in 1995.


Here’s what happened to Crazy Eddie’s (and what we believe will happen to Tile Shop)6:


The ‘Actual Pretax Earnings’ line above shows what the earnings would have been had the inventory
accounting fraud not occurred. Crazy Eddie’s inventory accounting fraud allowed the company to report
fictitious growth in pretax earnings. By 1987, the inventory accounting fraud was so egregious that Crazy
Eddie’s true earnings were losses (CRZY reported very positive pretax earnings to conceal the truth). See
the appendix for a more granular breakdown of the above calculation.


Tile Shop’s Inventory Accounting Malfeasance May Exceed Crazy Eddie’s


Gotham City Research believes Tile Shop is currently overstating gross profits more than it has ever done
before (as of September 30, 2013) as evidenced by a DSI of 414 days7:


Given that inventories are reported as a current asset, and that the Company classifies all its inventory
as current assets, a DSI over 400 days makes no sense. It seems like Tile Shop wants to have its cake and
eat it too, i.e. classify whatever it wants as inventories, so that gross profits are artificially boosted.

Page 19 of 58


We asked none other than Sam Antar, the former CFO of Crazy Eddie’s and a forensic accountant to
comment on the DSI of 414 days:


“Tile Shop, like many companies, categorizes inventories as a current asset, meaning that
inventories should be converted to cash within one-year.  However, DSI is 396 days in 2011 and
414 days as of September 30, 2013”


Gotham City Research believes that the 2011 and 2013YTD DSI figures indicate that those years’
inventories are overstated, cost of sales understated, and gross profits overstated.


Not only do TTS’s DSI figures for 2011 and 2013 make no sense, their DSI levels seem abnormally high
compared against Lumber Liquidators and Color Tile, Inc.8:


Allowance for Doubt Accounts No Longer Disclosed and Sales Return Reserve Looks Odd


Tile Shop used to disclose its allowance for doubtful accounts (in its S-4 filings):


Yet once TTS stock started trading publicly, it stopped disclosing this information: “As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, the allowance for doubtful accounts was not significant.”9 This seems quite strange for a
growing company, and a consumer-facing retailer.


Sales return reserves look odd as well. TTS sales increased from 2011 to 2012, and the company has a
very generous return policy yet sales return declined from 2011 to 201210:

Tile Shop’s 2013 TTM Earnings Overstatement Calculation


We estimate that TTS’s 2013 TTM earnings, after adjusting for the company’s inventory accounting
malfeasance, is around $9 million:


We estimate the inventory overstatement by calculating what the inventories would be if it had grown
at a rate in-line with sales and COGS growth. We calculate the difference between the reported
inventories and our estimate for actual inventories, and then add that difference to cost of sales. Profits
decline, and we arrive at $9 million in true earnings. This means reported adjusted earnings of $28
million is overstated by over 200%. We used the adj. EBITDA, EBIT figures shown from below11:

Tile Shop’s Explanations Regarding Gross Margins are Dubious or Demonstrably False


We are huge fans of the Dialectic/Socratic method of skeptical inquiry. We like to ask ourselves, “how
can we be wrong? What might we be missing?” We have looked to the company for answers. None of
their answers are satisfying. In fact, we believe management recently made provably false statements to
investors. TTS management recently told investors last week12:


"50% of our product comes from China. A lot of production and shipping shuts down in China in
January, so we have to build (inventory levels) for that as well. So we saw parts of that in Q3,
stepping up that [inventory] level.


Tile Shop’s above explanation is not credible for the following reasons:


 37 out of 72 Tile Shop import records were from China-based suppliers in January of 201313.
 Tile Shop had nearly a year’s worth of inventory leading into the Q3 quarter.
 Tile Shop has never disclosed this seasonal dynamic in SEC filings or earnings calls. Recall, TTS


does not even mention the word ‘China’ or ‘Chinese’ in its SEC filings.
 If China were to hypothetically cease all shipping activities for month, TTS would not have to


load up on inventory, given TTS’s DSI has consistently exceeded 340 days in the last few years.


Tile Shop Claims Inventories Increased Due to Purchases Related to its New Distribution Center


In the recent Q3 quarterly call, management claimed that inventories increased by $10 million due to its
new Durant, OK-based Distribution Center14:


With respect to the balance sheet as of September 30, let me make a few additional comments,
we ended the quarter with approximately $3.9 million of cash, $2.1 million of restricted cash,
and $90.1 million of debt. The increase in debt in the quarter of $15 million is the result of first,
an increase in inventory of $10 million, primarily related to the opening of the Durant
distribution facility and in preparation for the expected increase in revenues in the upcoming
months.


The problem we find with the explanation above is that TTS claimed that inventories rose in the prior
quarter, for the very same reason15:


Cash flow from operations in the second quarter was a use of cash of $3.6 million, as we added
substantial amounts of inventory to prepare the new distribution center for operation.


So Tile Shop is saying: we loaded on inventory in Q2, for our new DC… and we loaded up on even more
inventory in Q3? Even as DSI exceeded 400 days?


As they say: fool me once, shame on me. Fool me twice, shame on you.
Page 22 of 58


Additional Accounting and Oversight Issues


In the prior sections, we stated our belief that Tile Shop the bird is a duck, not a swan. TTS looks like a
duck, swims like a duck, and we’ve provided detailed photos and video footage showing as much. Yet
Wall Street and Tile Shop will have you believe TTS is a swan. In this section, we explain how Tile Shop
not only looks and swims like a duck, it sounds, sleeps, and smells like one too:


 Tile Shop has had 3 auditors in 2 years – McGladrey, Deloitte, and Ernst & Young. Tile Shop’s
reported inventories during that period look particularly dubious.


 TTS audit fees is less than one half its peers’ audit fees. Its audit fee is even lower than Ebix’s.
 Material weaknesses in internal controls were identified in 2011 and 2012. 2011 and 2013’s DSI


seems mathematically impossible, which suggests material weaknesses remain outstanding.
 TTS went public via the backdoor reverse merger/SPAC, just as many frauds in the past have.
 Bob Rucker’s immediate family and friends are employed by Tile Shop.
 No one in the Audit Committee has a CPA or a background in accounting/financial reporting.
 The current CFO has been with Tile Shop for just over a year, and there was an indefinite period


in 2012 in which TTS was without a CFO.
 CEO Bob Rucker’s failure to disclose Beijing Pingxiu as a related party resembles his intentional


failure to disclose vital information during his divorce proceedings.
 CEO Rucker’s 2012 compensation exceeded Lumber Liquidators’ CEO’s 2012 compensation by 5x.
 Ronnie Chan, a former board member of Enron, is a large shareholder of Tile Shop.


Before we go through all the above-mentioned, consider how Tile Shop may be explained by the ‘Fraud
Triangle’ framework (especially given our focus on its undisclosed related party):
Page 23 of 58


Tile Shop has had 3 Different Auditors in 2 Years


We believe Tile Shop will restate historical results significantly. Our belief seems strengthened by the
fact TTS has had 3 different auditors in 2 years. Investors should view TTS's reported financial
statements with a healthy dose of skepticism, given the myriad of accounting and oversight issues.


McGladrey LLP


From SEC filings:


On November 18, 2011, the board of managers of The Tile Shop dismissed McGladrey LLP, or
McGladrey, as its independent registered public accounting firm effective as of November 25.
Further, The Tile Shop engaged Deloitte & Touche LLP, or Deloitte, as its independent registered
public accounting firm during the first quarter of 2012. Deloitte is the independent registered
public accounting firm of the Company.


McGladrey’s report on The Tile Shop’s consolidated financial statement as of December 31, 2010,
and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, did not contain an adverse opinion
or disclaimer of opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or
accounting principles.


Deloitte and then Ernst & Young


From SEC filings:


Effective April 9, 2013, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Tile Shop Holdings, Inc.
(the “Company”) approved the dismissal of Deloitte & Touche LLP (“Deloitte”) as the Company’s
independent registered public accounting firm, and engaged Ernst & Young LLP (“E&Y”) as its
independent registered public accounting firm effective immediately.


Shockingly Low Audit Fees


Given all the problems we’ve identified thus far, it should be unsurprising that Tile Shop’s audit fees are
unusually low1:


Just by way of comparison, even Ebix’s (a subject of SEC, DOJ, and IRS investigations) historical audit fees
exceed Tile Shop’s2:
Page 24 of 58


Lumber Liquidators and Francesca’s audit fees also exceed TTS’s by 2x3:

Material Weaknesses Internal Controls


Given TTS’s auditor turnover, CFO turnover, low audit fees, and other problems we’ve identified, we
doubt that the material weaknesses described below have been remedied4:


On Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011, the Company reported the existence
of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting relating to deficiencies in
the financial statement close process. Specifically, the Company lacked sufficient personnel with
requisite competencies within its finance function for a company of its size and complexity and
did not maintain financial close processes, procedures, and reporting systems that were
adequately designed to support the accurate and timely reporting of its financial results. The
Company reported the remediation of this material weakness in Item 9A of its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012.


On a Form 8-K dated February 18, 2013, the Company reported that its previously-issued
financial statements for the three and nine months ended September 30, 2012 contained a
misstatement relating to its accounting for outstanding common stock purchase warrants, and
on a Form 10-Q/A filed March 18, 2013 restated such financial statements. As a result of the
restatement, on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2012 the Company reported
the existence of a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting relating to its
identification and analysis of the complex accounting and financial reporting attributes
associated with certain non-routine transactions such as the Company’s common stock purchase
warrant agreements, including not utilizing qualified external experts to supplement internal
resources. The Company plans to implement additional procedures to remediate this material
weakness.
Page 25 of 58


No One on Tile Shop’s Audit Committee Has a CPA or Financial Reporting/Accounting Experience5


Peter Jacullo III, Adam Suttin, and Peter Kamen sit on the Audit Committee, yet none of them appear to
be CPAs or former CFOs. None of them have disclosed any accounting or financial reporting experiences.
Peter Kamen serves as the chair of the committee, yet his experience seems limited to investing in
publicly traded securities or sitting on other boards.


Where is the CFO?


In an investor presentation dated June 27, 2012, there is a slide that touts TTS’s ‘Experience
Management Team’. A CFO is conspicuously absent:


It seems that the SEC noticed the absence of a CFO as well. According to a SEC correspondence letter
dated July, 19, 2012:


We note you have not listed a Chief Financial Officer as part of your management following the
Business Combination. Please add a footnote to your list or otherwise expand your disclosure to
address this position. Please also disclose how or by whom the functions and duties typically
performed by a Chief Financial Officer will be exercised.


The company responded:


In response to the Staff’s comment, the Company has added disclosure on pages 134 and 135 of
Amendment No. 1 that the Company intends to hire a chief financial officer and addressing how
or by whom the function and duties typically performed by a chief financial officer will be
exercised until such time.
Page 26 of 58


CEO Bob Rucker’s Lies of Omission


In the early 2000s, Bob Rucker underwent a bitter divorce with his ex-wife, Katherine Rucker. It turns
out that Bob Rucker deliberately misrepresented the prospects of Tile Shop’s business to the court. For
example, TTS internally estimated 2002 sales of $56.2 million and 63% gross margin, yet told the court it
expected sales of $48 million and 56% gross margins6:


Rucker provided the following Tile Shop financial forecast of to the court7:


In 2001, TTS was internally forecasting $6.9 million in net income before taxes. 2001’s actual reported
profits before tax was $6.7 million. Internally, Tile Shop estimated $6.3 million. Both the internally
projected and actual 2001 results are nearly 2x the estimate they provided the court.


We understand that divorces can be complex. However, we find Rucker’s material misrepresentations,
and defensive posturing disturbing. In deposition transcripts, he seems quite unapologetic8:


I'm not going to go and show McGladrey what to look for. I'm not an accountant. I wouldn't go
and show the bank what to look for. I'm not an accountant. I wouldn't go show Kaminsky [the
independent appraiser] what to look for. Misled? I didn't mislead him whatsoever.


We only highlight his divorce-related misrepresentations because we see a similar misrepresentation
with Tile Shop's business.


CEO Bob Rucker’s Compensation Seems Excessive


Rucker’s 2012 compensation stood at $5.85 million. Lumber Liquidator’s CEO compensation was $1.2
million in 2012. LL has 3x-4x more stores than TTS, yet TTS CEO made 5x more in compensation9. Tile
Shop has an "Omnibus Award Plan" that sets aside 2,500,000 shares annually for compensation through
2022 unless altered by the board ($55,000,000 annually at a stock price of $22.00/share); in 2013 the
full 2,500,000 was set aside for compensation. Additionally the plan provides for cash bonuses, limited
to $5,000,000 annually per individual (or 300% of base salary, whichever is greater). This level of
compensation seems extraordinarily high for a company the size of The Tile Shop.

Tile Shop Elected to Go Public via a Special-Purpose Acquisition Company


The Tile Shop went public via a SPAC transaction just over a year ago at $10.00/share. Within 50 days
(between 05/08/12 and 06/27/12), the transaction structure was negotiated, “due diligence” completed,
and the merger agreement, executed10.


In light of all the problems we’ve identified in this report (and in this section specifically), we feel that
the company deliberately avoided the traditional IPO listing process, so that it could avoid the spotlight.
SPAC investments have not historically fared well, as the average return for 111 SPACs between 2004
and 2013 returned -14.4%11. SPACs have a history of churning questionable companies.


A Former Board Member of Enron is a Significant Shareholder of Tile Shop


We have included direct excerpts and paraphrased from the Infitialis Research Collective’s piece on TTS,
below, as we believe they articulated the Chan brothers’ involvement very well:


Ronnie and Gerald Chan of Hong Kong currently control ~22.5% of The Tile Shop’s equity via their
Bahamian shell company Nabron International, Inc. After acquiring an original 30% equity
interest in The Tile Shop for only $12.0mm in total consideration in October 2002 (for an
approximately $2.2mm per store enterprise valuation versus the current market valuation of
$19.1mm per store), they have been highly motivated sellers at $15.00/share and $24.25/share
of the Company since going public via the SPAC at $10.00/share. As their 150-day lockup from
the most recent secondary share sell-down expired at the end of this month, it would not be
surprising if they are dumping a significant portion of their remaining $360mm equity value
ownership stake on the market (~60 days trading volume) at these current stratospheric
valuation levels.


In addition to the share overhang, the Chan Brothers’ intertwined involvement in the situation
raises further questions about the Company’s lead contaminated tile product sourcing
relationships in China in light of the numerous accusations of their involvement in significant
corruption and fraud throughout Asia.


Overall, this situation appears disturbingly similar to Enron Corporation, where Mr. Ronnie Chan
served as a Board of Directors and Audit Committee member leading up to its infamous Chapter
11 bankruptcy filing and was selling shares for his personal account up to the firm’s sordid
collapse. Finally, the Chan Brothers are not the only insiders selling, as a variety other Board of
Directors and management team members have been selling shares and indicating more shares
are forthcoming over the next 90 days via multiple form 144 registrations.

TTS Shares Are Worth No more Than $3.34 per Share


The art of valuation is only as good as the assumptions behind one’s techniques and calculations. As a
result, we are not dogmatic about which methods should or should not be employed. We do strongly
believe, however, that investors must base their investment decisions off reliable and accurate
information. Because we believe the Tile Shop’s reported earnings are inaccurate, it is far more
important for shareholders to determine what the true economics earnings of this company is, rather
than obsess over valuation methodologies. Information accuracy precedes everything else.


That being said, all valuation techniques suggest that TTS shares face significant downside, even after
avoiding the malfeasance we’ve highlighted earlier in this report. We believe the shares are worth no
more than $3/share, and arrive at a price target between $1.54 and $3.33 per share.


While our price target may seem low at first glance, note that Tile Shop is not a true growth company. It
is, at best, a capital intensive and cyclical business that has benefited from a housing boom and an
exuberant stock market. Gross margins have steadily declined over the last several years, and the
company currently generates no free cash flow. TTS cannot grow further without external capital.


Valuation Method #1: 20x-30x earnings on restated 2013e TTM


 As mentioned earlier in this report, we estimate that TTS’s 2013 TTM true earnings are closer to
$9 million, or $0.18/share:


 We apply a generous 20x -30x earnings multiple and arrive at an estimate of $180-$270 million
in value for the equity of the company. Because we believe the profit overstatements predate
2013, we expect additional inventory write-offs and accounting restatements. Therefore, we
think the shares warrant a discount to the $180-$270 million valuation range.


2013 TTM True Earnings Calculation
Net sales $217,945


Cost of sales $63,306
As Gross profit $154,639


Reported Adj. EBITDA $57,000
Adj. EBIT $44,000


Adj. earnings $28,172


Inventory Overstatement $19,002
True EBIT $24,998


Interest expense $2,495
Income Tax Expense $13,333


True Earnings $9,170
True Earnings per share $0.18
Page 29 of 58


Valuation Method #2: TTS is worth $82-$165 million, or $1.0-$2.2 million per store, per CEO Rucker’s
estimates


 50% of Tile Shop’s equity was valued at $7.125mm, according to the financial forecast CEO
Robert Rucker presented, per legal filings1. This comes out to $1.02mm per store on an
enterprise value basis.


 The same court found that Bob Rucker deliberately misrepresented the prospects of TTS
business. The court revised the appraisal of Tile Shop utilizing the correct financial forecast, and
at arrived at a $30.7mm enterprise valuation. This implies the business is worth $2.2mm per
store (including penalties and interest due).


 There are 82 stores as of the most recent earnings release.
 Bob Rucker and the other sellers of the Company, considered a merger whereby TTS would be


valued $450mm in enterprise value (9.0x expected EBITDA for 2012).


Valuation Method #3: Comparable Companies Analysis


 Absent the issues identified in this report,  TTS looks rich relative to peers (especially given it
lacks the ability to grow absent additional outside capital)


 The company is trading at a meaningful premium to other high growth concerns (that lack the
issues we believe TTS faces)2:


 Because Tile Shop is a capital intensive business, book value matters. Tile Shop currently trades
at 14x book value.


 We believe TTS will trade at a discount, not a premium to its peers, as the issues we identify in
this report become clearer to other investors.


 TTS may have been a ‘housing play’ at one point in time, but as Select Comfort shows, there is
room for both winners and losers in a housing boom and a rising stock market.

DCF Considerations


We don’t believe DCF is the appropriate valuation technique in the case of Tile Shop for several reasons
(one big reason: TTS’s numbers aren’t reliable). However, if one must build a DCF model, here is what
we would consider:


 We believe TTS true 2013 TTM earnings is around $9 million. One must forecast future cost of
sales and inventory levels that are in-line with peers, in order to a proper DCF analysis.


 Future gross margins are guaranteed to tank if one makes the conservative (and realistic)
modeling assumption that inventory growth is in-line with sales growth.


 TTS has little to no cash, sizeable debts, and covenants.
 There are signs of store saturation. New stores are being built in highly competitive locations


and new store productivity is low.
 Taxes are trending up, as evidenced by the most recent 10Q:


 Color Tile Inc, Tile Shop’s predecessor, filed for bankruptcy in the week of January 27, 19963:


Color Tile Inc., a flooring retailer that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection earlier this week,
said Friday it's closing 234 stores nationwide, including 12 in Illinois. After the closings, the
retailer said it will have 387 stores in 48 states. The closings will be spread out geographically


The company subsequently liquidated4:


Color Tile, once the nation's largest retailer of floor coverings, is closing its doors under pressure
from lenders and sliding sales. The company confirms that it will shut down all of its 195
company-owned stores and lay off 831 employees.


Perhaps tile retailing is, at core, a terrible business. Color Tile’s reported gross margins ranged
between 41%-49%, according to the SEC filings we reviewed. Tile Shop may experience a
diseconomies of scale (as Color Tile was much larger than Tile Shop), going forward.

TTS has Missed EPS Guidance 4 out of the Last 5 Quarters


Typically, growth stocks exhibit momentum in their reported earnings as well as in their stock price.
They also tend to consistently meet and/or beat expectations to the upside. Surprises tend to be
“positive surprises.”


This is not the case with Tile Shop. TTS earnings and cash flow growth have been irregular, and gross
margins have actually trended down. As we show below, Tile Shop has missed earnings 4 out of the last
5 quarters:
Page 32 of 58


Credit Agreement and Negative Covenants


If Tile Shop restates historical results as we believe it will, that means TTS is in violation of credit
covenants and qualifies for an event default. We believe that the issues we expose in this report should
(and will) lead TTS’s creditors to:


 Restrict capex spending
 Prevent any share buybacks
 Prevent TTS’s ability to take on additional debt capital
 Demand that TTS start paying back debt immediately, if not in full


From TTS Credit Agreement, amended July 8, 20131:

Appendix A: Lead and Product Safety Concerns


In the recent Q3 conference call, CEO Bob Rucker said the following:


I would like to spend just a few minutes before we take questions on the issue of our product
quality and our product safety which has been questioned recently. Let me first say that I take
these matters very seriously and frankly personally.


When I started The Tile Shop 28 years ago my mission was to provide customers with not only an
exciting shopping experience but to also provide our customers with unique all natural tile
products for their homes. I take great pride in the fact that all of our products are produced from
natural substances.


With the use of natural substances, however, comes the possibility that they may contain trace
amounts ofinorganic metals. Also glazing compounds used in ceramics may contain small
quantities of these elements, however during the ceramic tile manufacturing process, the
process of firing the tile and the glaze at extremely high temperatures uses any of these
elements into the tile. As a result they pose no health or safety risk.


However in an abundance of caution over the past 10 days, we have worked with our vendors
around the world to revalidate that no unnatural substances are used in the manufacture, or
fabrication of the products that we purchased. We have also tested a number of these products
ourselves. In addition, we have engaged URS the worldwide provider of Engineering,
Construction and Technical Services and the leading provider of Environmental Services to
validate our understanding and conclusions with respect to the overall safety of our products.


Based on all of the evidence we have accumulated from these procedures, coupled with the
information provided by our third party experts, we are able to reaffirm our longstanding
conclusions that the products we sell pose no health or safety risk.


We are committed to providing our customers with the highest quality of natural stone, ceramic
and glass tile products. We will continue to expand our quality control procedures and we will
provide more information on this matter on our website.


Gotham City Research holds no opinions on the safety of Tile Shop’s products (there were no health
hazards related to the Crazy Eddie’s product, yet the company still committed fraud). Note the following:


 There are plenty of “natural substances” that are poisonous or hazardous to human health.
 Lead is a carbon based substance. It is also a natural substance.
 Given the underlined statements above, we find the CEO’s answers highly deceptive. This does


not mean Tile Shop’s products are, therefore, hazardous. We just find it concerning that the CEO
is engaging in classic Spy the Lie tactics of deception and distraction.


 In the following pages, we include the Infitialis Research Collective’s assessment of TTS lead-
related concerns.
